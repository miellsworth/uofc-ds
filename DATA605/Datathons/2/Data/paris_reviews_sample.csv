8313266,176885591,2017-08-01,7762489,Mike,Jean-Pierre's place met our needs perfectly. It is a fantastic location right in the Marais with a ton of great restaurants bars and shops. It's also easy walk (or use the public bike share) to most major sites like the Louvre Notre Dame les Tuilleries and Ile de St. Louis. We even biked past the Arc de Triomphe to the phenomenal Gehry -designed Fondation Louis Vuitton. The apartment itself is very cozy clean and comfortable and Jean-Pierre couldn't have been nicer and easier to coordinate with.  Perfect for 1 or a couple.

18603659,336413631,2018-10-14,96240880,Erin,Our stay at Charlotte's place was absolutely fantastic. We loved the apartment everything was as described tidy and stylish. The location was excellent being both in a great neighborhood with tons of good restaurants – and close to public transportation. It was easy to get just about anywhere in the city in under 30 minutes with the apartment as our starting point. Charlotte left some great notes on what was good in the area as well incredibly helpful. Charlotte was also very quick to respond to any questions which was so appreciated. I absolutely recommend.

Gam is very helpful and great person was always in contact and ready to help out anytime! Apartment is in the great area with lots of cafes and restaurants. Also its walking distance to many sightseeings. Definitely recommended!!

27132220,338393730,2018-10-19,209673481,Miranda,The Louvre apartment was spacious secure beautifully furnished with a lovely bathroom. It was quiet comfortable and convenient. This is a fantastic choice for a short Paris stay far preferable to a hotel and one place I would definitely recommend. You could not find a more central location and you had a choice of wonderful restaurants moments away. Added to this you are just a stone’s throw from the Paris metro. Our hosts made our stay a comfortable one.  Thank you so much!!
328847,24596776,2014-12-31,23153402,Ville,Kun menimme asunnolle kaikki oli juuri niinkuin oli sovittu. Avaimien nouto ja kaikki muukin onnistui erittäin helposti. Asunto oli mukava ja rauhallisella alueella ja sinne oli mukava palata pitkän päivän jälkeen Pariisissa. Ehdottomasti voisin mennä uudestaan.

We were well warned about the tight spaces around the stairs but travelers should note the very steep access to the toilet shower and mezzanine.   Communication was great.  We really had a great time.

Fuimos recibidos por Cristiana y despedidos por Federica ambas amigas de Palma. La casa es muy comoda para dos personas. Con todo lo necesario para pasar muy bien en Paris. La ubicación es perfecta. Un lindo barrio con supermercado a una cuadra y varios lugares para comer en los alrededores. Boca de metro a 150 metros. Las galerias Lafayette a dos cuadras y la Opera Garnier a tres. La verdad que la ubicación es excelente. Pasamos muy bien.

29450673,403562002,2019-01-21,171163840,Sabrina,Staying at Sofia's place was lovely! So close to the metro station and Gare du Nord which was very convenient. Sofia replied to messages quickly and even let us leave our suitcases in the apartment while we enjoyed our last day in Paris (there was a bit of a mis-communication about this but it was all resolved in the end!). The only downside was she lives on the 5th floor so a lot of stairs! I would highly recommend staying at this Airbnb :)

539722,82837007,2016-06-29,55144010,Linda,I called the manager prior to our arrival and confirmed that she would meet us. It all worked perfectly. The location was great less than a block from the metro. There were plenty of bakeries and cafes near by as well as fruit vendors and a market. The Latin quarter  the Pompidou and Notre dame were all easily walkable with our two children 7 &10. The kids bedroom was a quite small and dark but adequate . The bathroom is fantastic

The flat is on the 5th floor so you get a bit of a work out as well;)
This is though very common for flats in Paris.
Christophe was very kind and easy to communicate with. "

21832031,218340003,2017-12-12,14921978,Arthur,"Theo’s flat was one of the BEST Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. The space is awesome the location is perfect the beds are comfortable and Theo is a super host. He gave us a bunch of local tips of must see restaurants/bars shopping and all were a 10/10.

It’s going to be very common to say that everything was perfect ! Not saying it wouldn’t be fair. It wouldn’t be fair neither to say that the pictures of the place are realistic : the real thing is even more magic !! 

So to be short. The flat is just SPLENDID : cosy comfy like any home you’d dream of decorated with tremendous good taste pleasant to spend time in… 

⁃The neighborhood : from what we’ve seen in few days the best place to be in Paris !  Loads of nice restaurants shops lovely architecture some of a hipster atmosphere but most places are still affordable. 

⁃The host : Theodore s welcome is warm helpful flexible  all attentive to the little details that make you feel at ease. Thank you for that… 
We wouldn’t imagine to come back in Paris without trying to stay at your place again !"

13672547,115826427,2016-11-27,24661589,Charlie,Un studio très correct mais tout de même assez froid et humide et sombre en hiver.

9446428,116881859,2016-12-04,50311973,Kaye,We only stayed one night but we had a really great time. It was a really good base in between all the sights we saw. Ji was helpful with storing our luggage on the last day so we didn't have to lug them around. Would highly recommend it!

Il est à quelques pas des Metro Cambrone et La Motte Picquet Grenelle qui permettent de rejoindre rapidement tous les points d'intérêt de Paris. L'appartement est au rez-de-chaussée il ne faut donc pas s'attendre à une vue sur les toits de Paris.

His flat is perfectly located in very central Paris a stone's throw from loads of restaurants markets shops and other kinds of entertainment one might like. Joe's place is comfy and clean with a lot of personal touch that makes Airbnb experiences so special.
Looking forward to coming again!"

13108322,93898313,2016-08-14,19504111,Celine,Dans ce joli quartier de Montmartre une belle rencontre avec Bonnie qui nous a accueillis chaleureusement dans son appartement très confortable et bien équipé. Nous avons passé un très bon séjour et nous recommandons ce logement !
17954630,267584739,2018-05-22,6371355,Adam,"Viviane was really communicative throughout and clear instructions on how to get into the apartment. 

The place is great plenty of space for a couple and a lovely light apartment. The location is great right in the middle of Montmartre/Pigalle but as it’s on a private courtyard it’s totally silent.  

The apartment feels really homely and had everything we needed. 

The only thing I can think of that wasn’t good is that the wifi password is difficult to get right - hardly the biggest problem! Would definitely stay at Viviane’s apartment again. "
22630351,441813082,2019-04-22,19508080,Neha,"We had a comfortable stay at Valentin’s place. It’s nice for a short trip to Paris and if you are out and about and need a clean place to sleep.
He left us good recommendations for eating and flat is close to many eateries and bars.
Overall comfortable stay in an area that is quickly getting gentrified."

4882717,454478682,2019-05-18,258615225,Alex,"Things I like: 
1.Perfect location. Subway stations only few mins walk; nice restaurants and bakery store nearby. 

2. Really nice owner. Respond very fast and very helpful. 


Things I don’t like: 
1.  Shower room is tiny.... it’s a bit hard to bend or turn around.  I’m about 182cm(5’10) and 80kg(176 lbs)
And the water heater tank is small so you need to wait 30mins after first person took the shower otherwise you will be out of hot water in the middle of shower like me. (Owner did wrote the instructions on the wall but I didn’t notice it.) 

Overall it’s a good place to stay for travellers. Old building small room but got everything you may need.  Location is the advantage."

6600888,53609921,2015-11-10,45326662,Emerald,Gaëlle was a wonderful host. Always friendly and welcoming while sharing her home. Room description is accurate and location to metro was very convenient. Slight drawback was the 5 flights of stairs required to get to the room. Not a problem unless you have a disability which prevents you from using stairs. Overall a great experience and l would recommend to my friends in the future.

1456058,546863569,2019-10-14,188204756,Val,Pierre est très gentil et accueillant.  L'appartement est bien situé près du métro des magasins des restaurants.  Appartement dans une vieille maison sans ascenseur.  Si des problèmes de mobilité je ne conseille pas.  La chambre présentée est de bonne taille avec un lit pour 2 personnes.  L'appartement lui-même est très petit en particulier la cuisine et les toilette avec la douche.  Je ne conseille pas pour les personnes de grandes tailles.  À mon avis cet appartement ne peut être loué que pour une courte période de 2 à 3 jours.
2335559,290946880,2018-07-15,19057940,Christophe,L'emplacement de la péniche permet de pleinement profiter de Paris tout en étant au bord de l'eau. Séjour agréable sous le soleil tout en étant au cœur de la capitale pour la victoire des bleus!

Je ne vois pas quoi dire d'autre tant les superlatifs positifs qui ont été émis dans d'autres commentaires sont pour moi une réalité.
Je recommande  cet appartement et cet hôte mais est-ce bien nécessaire quand on voit la difficulté à s'inscrire sur son calendrier.
Continu comme cela Pascal."

20137064,312913238,2018-08-24,125600312,Lukas,The apartment was smaller than expected. Was problematic even with two people. Couldn’t imagine living there with four people.

- It's more than super clean.
- It has more equipments than what you need (cooking pan pot various kitchen utensils extra towels in different sizes flat iron different sets of bed and pillow covers and etc....)
- It's perfectly located (max 3 minutes walk to Eiffel tower and 1 minute walk to a supermarket and4 minute walk to a metro station).
- It's in a quiet area. 
Mirielle was so nice to put 4 beers for us in the fridge! And she was very quick to respond.
This house made our trip to Paris very comfortable and memorable!
Thank you Mirielle for everything. I will come back to your house when I come back to Paris! :)"

Довольно чистые номера хоть и не со свежим ремонтом приятно удивлены были наличием второй ванны. Отличная терасса приветливый персонал. 
Но были удивлены небольшому «сюрпризу». После длительной прогулки решив принять ванну одной из нас пришлось смывать шампунь холодной водой а на третью воды и вовсе не хватило. Так что приезжая компанией больше 2 человек - экономьте воду "

True to all the other reviews the apartment is very clean and comfortable. The building feels very safe with security check in (key safe box). The apartment is ideally situated in a neighborhood full of restaurants and cafes. Many local attractions are within walking distance. The apartment is fully equipped for long- and short-term stays. There are many small touches that show the host’s attention to details and affection for the place. Kylliki has been a very gracious host who waited for me on my check-in day and gave me a warm welcome. She diligently walked us through the apartment and all its amenities and provided tips about the neighborhood. All in all a very good experience staying at her place."

1491910,26857689,2015-02-21,23408532,Luca,Nulla da togliere all accoglienza  il quartiere è tranquillo di giorno molto meno la sera. 200 scale per salire sopra casa dalla metro piu vicina... La casa è davvero piccola  più di quanto sembra dalle foto e condomino fatiscente.

The space good beds and bath for the children we really felt at home. The safe parking for our car just across the street was excellent very friendly check-in and the subways just around the corner to bring you everywhere you want in Paris including Euro Disney in 45-60 minutes (M line 4 + RER). 
Just book this superb place!!"

6611828,84534072,2016-07-07,53168523,Eli,The apartment was cozy with a lot of personality. Close to metro. The Bastille area is maybe not the perfect area when you travel with children ( a lot of bars/ clubs) but the noise at night was not a problem from the apartment.

17730202,286025865,2018-07-05,24880058,Ej,I read many of reviews and they are pretty accurate. The apartment is in good condition as expected. It is located walking distance to the SNCF train station (Gare de l’est) that routes to Champagne or other regions. Great if you plan to do some day trips in to neighboring towns. 
1581357,155347285,2017-05-28,101658651,Thatiany,O anfitrião nos recebeu na hora marcada e foi muito simpático. A localização do apartamento é excelente pertinho do arco do triunfo metro e da rua Champs. Ainda tem restaurantes ao lado do apartamento. Super recomendo!!

6737490,58924225,2016-01-05,46491942,Katherine,Florence put us in contact with her friend who was very charming and friendly. They were both very good at communicating and gave us some great recommendations of places to visit in the area. The neighborhood is not the most beautiful but that is made up for with the size and beauty of the apartment. Also it is close to two metro lines.
1159668,257221887,2018-04-25,35086995,Francesca,I highly recommend this apt - it's 5 minutes to the metro station. It's clean and can comfortably accommodate 7 persons. The apt is full of toys and DVDs - it's great if you are traveling with kids. They will love it! I had a great stay with my family!
905766,121989489,2016-12-20,37788129,Federica,Good position. There are many restaurant and pubs near the apartment. Ferdinand is a very nice personhe has helped us with metro and suggested us something activities in town. The only problem about the apartment is that's on sixth floor and there isn't a lift. 
11249452,128375676,2017-01-24,892148,Valerie,The apartment is very nice the neighborhood is great the wifi needs to be improved

27288,297728876,2018-07-28,23484645,Georgina,Simone’s apartment was fantastic. The apartment was close to the Metro and to the La Villette area of the Seine. It was a spacious space and perfect for my mother and I. I recommend the artisan patisserie down the road. Thank you Simone for an unforgettable stay!
5388226,214694825,2017-11-26,54995681,Emilie,"Appartement très agréable et spacieux nous étions 5 voyageurs et étions tout à fait à l'aise. Logement parfaitement équipé linge de lit et de toilette largement suffisant couchages très confortables chauffage adapté double vitrage très performant.
Echanges agréables et efficaces avec Fabienne puis avec Xavier très sympathique qui a dû nous laisser les clés sans nous rencontrer car nous avions pris beaucoup de retard au cours de notre trajet depuis Dijon.
Le quartier n'est peut-être pas le plus heureux de Paris mais l'emplacement était parfait pour nous qui souhaitions pouvoir rayonner à pied entre L'Aérosol l'après-midi puis les Docks le soir (trajets de 10-15 minutes maxi). De plus toutes commodités au pied de l'immeuble (commerces et transports).
Petite info utile à noter enfin : nous n'avions pas remarqué que le digicode ne fonctionnait que jusqu'à 19h30 et qu'il fallait après cet horaire utiliser la clé or notre groupe de 5 s'est séparé en 2 au cours de la soirée certains étant rentrés plus tôt avec la seule clé et étant injoignables. Heureusement nous n'avons attendu que 10 minutes avant qu'une habitante ne rentre aux alentours de 4h... Cette information (""code porte de ...h à 19h30"") est notée dans les fiches pratiques à disposition dans l'appartement mais peut-être gagnerait-elle à être plus ""alarmante"" et explicite (suggestion faite à Fabienne).
Malgré cette ""aventure"" (qui ajoute un peu de sel et de souvenirs au séjour^^) c'était parfait de A à Z !"

14096780,221363319,2017-12-26,30587620,Vera,It is a really nice flat affordable and situated in a nice neighborhood close to Père Lachaise Cemetery. Unfortunately is much tinier that I would imagine looking at the pictures. My husband is 1.80 meters tall man had barely stretched his legs on the bed and couldn't stand straight under the upper bed deck. Overall: really good choice for people like me - shorter than 1.65 meters :)
31797810,472771518,2019-06-20,137481168,Juliette,Very cozy and well - located flat ! There were 6 of us and we were a bit tight but the place is very comfortable. Thomas is a welcoming and communicative host and the flat itself it 3 mins away from Belleville station which is super helpful. The eggs and available food were a nice touch. Overall would highly recommend!

771414,39778902,2015-07-26,26543014,Charlotte,"Victor welcomed us with wine and biscuits and we instantly felt comfortable in his little flat :). Me and my two friends fit in it quite well - two of us on the bed and a third on the comfortable air mattress the kitchen had a good size and we even had the opportunity to eat on the patio. The separation into toilet and bathroom/shower was very practical in the mornings. Victor was even nice enough to take care of our garbage for us after we left!
The area is very convenient - there is a supermarket only 2 minutes away and we could walk to Sacre Coeur in about 10 minutes. The metro is also located only five minutes away and the way to Charles de Gaulle is quite easy!! :)
All in all we had an amazing time there and we can only thank Victor a thousand times for making our stay there so easy! :)"

2869015,319835349,2018-09-07,68745755,Joseph,Claire was one of the best hosts I’ve ever had while using Airbnb. She was really kind friendly and fun to talk to! The location was great with nearby public transit that can take you to any part of Paris but is still hidden away from tourists so you can really get an authentic feel of the city. I arrived in Paris not knowing what to expect but I left really loving it thanks to a combination of the many things that Paris has to offer and Claire’s warm hospitality. I would recommend this room for other travellers.
5953548,105935611,2016-10-03,85277977,Kelly,Beautiful flat very clean and tidy with great decorations. With in walking distance from metro station and very easy to get anywhere from. Would highly recommend

The apartment is as in the pictures it is well equiped and very comfortable .  We would recommend Frederic's place the location is fantastic and easy to get to place from the metro is super close along with buses and a great spot to start walking from.  Thanks Fredric hope we get to stay again soon.  LesleyJustin and kids
6931058,244660141,2018-03-19,93508744,Michelle,Yafeh and Loïk's apartment is a really a special place. There was plenty of space for me and my 6 year old daughter. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood eating fresh pastries and taking in local culture. Yafeh and Loïk were so attentive and quick to help with anything we needed. The decor was so beautiful and the bathroom was super cute. We can't wait for our next trip. Michelle and Lily NY
2729247,104244262,2016-09-25,7178187,Irwin,We were a family of 5 with 3 primary school kids. This meant that the apartment was a good size for us with the adults having the bed and the kids sharing the sofa bed & an ottoman bed. It would be a squeeze for 5 adults. Please note that Alexis has beautiful & expensive items in his apartment so it would be suitable for well behaved and older children. Supermarket conveniently located & wonderful Eric Kayser bakery was a favourite.

28737625,336975924,2018-10-15,58573128,Jerry,"Hajar is a delightful host. This was a shared residence and that always adds the dimension of the quality of the interaction between the host and guest.  
My excellent experience started before I arrived with Hajar communicating quickly and completely. I made this booking with only a few advance days notice and she confirmed right away gave me good directions  supplied all the necessary check-in codes and continued to communicate with me as my wanderings took me back to Paris.
I chose her place because it is so very well-located to the most popular sites most visitors will want to see.  While I'm no stranger to the Metro her place is within easy and short walking distance to the Louvre Orsay Museum Place de la Concorde Camps Elysees and more. I couldn't have chosen a better location!
And finally there's Hajar herself. I arrived after 9 PM very tired from my multiple journey to Normandy Brittany and wine country. She greeted me and offered a glass of wine which was so very much appreciated. We chatted for over 45 minutes andshe added very positively to my experience.
I would not hesitate to stay at her residence again!"

8348359,535448892,2019-09-24,129142848,Janice,Fabienne was an amazing host she is very sweet and communication was great. The apartment was beautifully decorated and spotless! The terrace was such a great amenity and truly makes this place worth the money. The neighborhood is quiet with markets pharmacies places to eat and order. My husband and I had no issues getting to all the tourists sites as they were all just about 20 minutes away. I would definitely recommend this place!

24276143,307317799,2018-08-14,61973938,Clifford,We have stayed at many airbnbs in France and we absolutely LOVED Raphael's place and is now our favorite place and will 100% stay here again when back in Paris.  Super modern cool and funky decor yet mixed with exposed stone walls and wood beams... spacious living room with very nice quality furniture. The kitchen is within the living area and has beautiful modern cabinets tons of accessories everything you need including really nice dishes glassware and silverware (copper!)  The bedroom is spacious and has a large wardrobe to store your things. Super SPACIOUS shower/bathroom area which is uncommon in France- no toilet in a tiny closet.  Awesome soft plush bedding and big comfortable bed. Beautiful sliding glass doors and super cool lighting and lots of it.  The best part was the thoughtful personal touches like the trays next to each side of the bed and in the sink area. Beautiful touches without being cluttered.... If you are a couple or even a solo traveler this is the perfect place in Paris. Location cannot be beat with everything outside your doorstep...

9904517,449701836,2019-05-07,93017234,Becky,Loved the 4 day stay.  There were 4 of us and the large beautifully appointed living room was a great place to sit listen to a large selection of music and recap our Parisian adventures.  Kitchen had all the necessities for meal prep if so desired.  Access to bedrooms might be difficult for those with knee or hip issues but otherwise adequate comfortable and clean.  Thanks Julien

18080169,294420354,2018-07-22,115021623,Tristam,"A beautifully well thought out Parisian flat in a lovely part of town. Gorgeous natural light floods the lower floor in the mornings as you step out to pick up a croissant from the local boulangerie. The huge bath in the bedroom was a real luxury.

Valérie was a fantastic host who made us feel very welcome. We’d love to come back!"

22073570,222985647,2017-12-31,161599111,Didier,On ne  peut que recommander l'appartement d'Anne-Laure et Benoît à toutes les personnes qui veulent faire une escapade à Paris. Très bien situé dans la secteur d'Alésia ( XIVe) un quartier plutôt sympa à la fois calme et doté de tous les services à proximité( bars restaurants boulangeries pharmacie supermarchés...). L'appartement est  lui spacieux très agréable à vivre bien équipé et joliment décoré. On peut y venir à quatre sans problèmes.Le tout à un prix raisonnable. Enfin  nous avons également apprécié la petite attention de bienvenue de ce jeune couple sympathique. Vraiment une bonne surprise qui a participé au plaisir de notre séjour
3450265,170852131,2017-07-16,5317916,José,"La estadía en lo de Sylvie fue muy cómoda. Estuvimos con mi esposa en el departamento los últimos días de nuestra luna de miel en europa. El departamento es pequeño pero muy bien distribuido y equipado. Pero lo mejor que tiene es la ubicación. Es una zona fabulosa a metros de restaurantes bistros verdulerías y supermercados. 
Recomiendo este lugar y lo elegiría en mis futuros viajes a Paris por su comodidad y ubicación."
2084939,37866626,2015-07-11,33270484,Rassanun,Caroline is very good host waiting for us to check-in providing some food + flower on check-in and extremely helpful helping us to book a Maxicab when we have a problem in booking.  The apartment is as shown in the picture.  Very comfortable for us (5 people) as it has 3 beds.  My 3 kids were enjoying the apartment so much as they played with toys (eg. kitchen sets for girls) every day after we came back to the apartment.  It is lovely apartment for family.

The room is very clean and cosy and has everything you need (including ""tourist-friendly"" items such as binders with all kind of information maps adapters toiletries etc.). I felt very comfortable and I would definitely stay there again."
24647360,361756345,2018-12-24,35945088,Amy,This apartment is in a very nice location on a quiet street in the Marais- but though there are 2 rooms there are no doors and the whole apartment is connected as 1 large room so there is no privacy at all- it would be a great  place for a family with small children. However more than 2 adults does not really work in the layout. It is definitely not for families with adult children.
29116487,467411436,2019-06-10,24831233,Orlando,Really cozy apartment 3 minutes walking from a metro station. Perfect for 4 people. The communication was good with the host.
8480520,55643636,2015-12-03,12651204,Jimmy,Appartement conforme à la description. Je me suis senti chez moi. Je recommande fortement cet appartement pour vos séjours touristiques et professionnels à Paris. Tout est à proximité. J'ai été bien accueilli. Expérience à renouveler avec grand plaisir. Merci Labatu et sa sympatique soeur Marlène.
780909,14334976,2014-06-17,10749615,Michelle,"Olga was an amazing host. She met me at the impeccable apartment on time to give me the keys and the layout.  She made me feel comfortable and was patient when I had questions. 
Perfect location perfect apartment. 
The only reason I will not be staying here during my next visit is because the studio is not available. 

Thank you Olga!"

Recommendations des restaurants aux alentours qui nous a été très utile. À l’occasion je n’hésiterai pas à refaire appel à Éric. Il a été très professionnel et patient. 
19254073,330015255,2018-09-30,22019769,Romain,Very spacious flat in the center of Paris very well located 5 minutes away from two subways surrounded by Boulangeries! Emmanuelle was a great host and very arranging for tot get and drop the keys always answering fast to our questions! I would highly recommend this flat!
7872357,58863636,2016-01-05,8892632,Kendall,We wanted to celebrate New Years Eve in Paris and this studio was the perfect location for us!  There were 3 of us and the 2 bedroom studio was fabulous for us.  The location is incredible just down the street from the Luxembourg RER stop the proximity to the gardens was wonderful and the surrounding area is full of fabulous bars bakeries and restaurants.  The studio is cozy and has just about every amenity you could need.  For those over 6 feet the upstairs of the studio is a stretch as you'll have to duck your head that's the only slight downside.   David was a wonderful host!  He was kind accommodating and incredibly helpful!  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in Paris!

4409288,71401483,2016-04-25,1092360,Tim,We had a mixed experience at Ismail's place.  On the positive side the location and views are great as others have said.  On the negative side we were surprised there was only one bed when the description said 2 beds and the photos appeared to be 2 different rooms but upon closer inspection the same room with dramatically different furnishings. We made use of the pullout couch but that wasn't what we were expecting.  The other surprise was Ismail said there was a $35 cleaning fee unless we cleaned the apartment ourselves.  This should have been included in the official Airbnb pricing list but was only communicated in person and felt awkward.  Ismail pointed out precious rugs on the floor that were in front of both terrace doors but didn't say why.  Were we not supposed to walk on them?  Lastly there was a major network installation scheduled for Sunday that included 2 massive cranes outside the windows crews accessing the roof via ladder just outside our unit and do-not-cross tape surrounding the building entrance.  We felt we should have been given notice of such a considerable development.  
14260154,537859320,2019-09-29,215903748,Colin,The location could not be better. Marc-André’s is extremely responsive and helpful. Suggest you try to meet with him to try to understand how everything works in the apartment. Would  definitely return. He should add “Freddy’s” restaurant and Marks and Spencer to his recommendations. Great trip!
240938,15478846,2014-07-09,14565866,Jean Francois,Prestation conforme à la proposition. Confort très rustique  et satisfaisant. Lieu insolite dans un quartier  singulier. Je n ai pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer valerie mais la communication à été efficace. Je recommande ce lieu aux personnes recherchant plus un lieu insolite bien placé  qu un confort cossu.
756756,109515510,2016-10-22,86492465,다솔,공항에서는 지하철타고 약 1시간정도 걸리고 passy 역이나 trocadero역의 중간위치에 위치해있고 집주변은 너무 안전한 동네이였으며 집에는 엘리베이터가 있어서 짐을 옮기는데 편했습니다. 창문을 열면 에펠탑 끝부분이 보이고 집에서 5-10분정도 걸어가면 에펠탑을 볼 수 있습니다. 너무 깔끔하고 위치적으로는 너무 적합한 곳이었던것 같습니다. 다만 화장실 샤워하는곳이 문이 따로없고 유리 가벽만있어서 약간 불편한점빼고는 불편한점을 느낀적이 없습니다. 다음에 또 방문하게 된다면 다시 방문하고 싶을 정도의 최적의 위치와 청결함 그외 기타 너무너무 좋았습니다 :-) merci 
27482459,325646616,2018-09-20,23283953,Christiane,I have no hesitation at all in recommending a stay at Caroline's apartment and hope my first stay was not the last. The hospitality was amazing the location perfect and the amenities provided above standard. I did not feel at all that having to access the apartment via Caroline's living room was a drawback (and that is going to change anyway) as it provided an opportunities for a chat.

Апартаменты находятся в здании особняка правда на цокольном этаже из-за чего по вечерам бывает шумно от прохожих т.к. окна находятся на уровне их ног. Также по ночам беспокоят комары учтите это и возьмите средства защиты."
7503850,526728798,2019-09-09,289757035,Erik,"It’s a nice cozy and quiet place in Paris. As soon as you enter the first door all the noises from the city fade away. I slept with the windows open and I didn’t hear a thing!

The place itself is clean and has everything you need if you’re looking for a place to stay for a couple of nights. 

Communication with the host was quick and easy. She was flexible in her check in/out times and gave clear instructions on how to find and enter the place."
37057444,527264319,2019-09-10,104189617,Ali,Perfect apartment for 3 people or a couple looking to stay in The center of Paris! Location was awesome as we were only 15mins walking distance to the Arc metro and bus stops were right around the corner. And the neighborhood is probably the safest in town.

It is also bigger than the photos lead me to expect along with the big window into the central courtyard with the trees... I found the flat relaxing and full of character - defo worth going her than above an hotel in my opinion"
2622898,32932134,2015-05-23,3707016,James,This is a really lovely apartment perfectly located just off the Canal Saint-Martin. Very easy to find being just a few minutes walk down  the road from the Jacques Bonsergent metro stop and in a fantastic neighborhood with plenty of delicious bakeries cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The apartment itself was very clean and beautifully furnished. We didn't meet Chiara as our flight arrived in Paris late evening but she provided us with lots of useful information and check-in was super easy - we especially appreciated the recommendations from Chiara on places to see during our stay in Paris. Thanks so much!

7747553,153386074,2017-05-21,68148288,James,Evelyn is a wonderful host and the apartment's facilities (living room full kitchen including clothes washer) were great. Despite some challenges with the loft her apartment was very adequate for us. The location is great quite close to the Eiffel tower near the supermarket and we enjoyed the outdoor clothing and food market (several mornings each week) by the Dupleix metro stop. I don't recall the listing having mentioned the very narrow circular staircase to the loft and the need to swat under a low (around 3 feet high) beam in the loft to get to the bed and the very low slanted ceiling making it very difficult for a 2nd person to access and use the bed without hitting their head. The headroom in the loft bedroom is unsuitable for guests taller than 68 inches and the narrow circular staircase is not suitable for someone who is elderly overweight or has hip or knee problems.

950501,47636263,2015-09-21,27875493,Rod,Just back from a wonderful stay at Pierre's lovely apartment. Pierre is a very kind and helpful host always willing to please. The apartment is very clean comfortable and perfectly placed to enjoy the best of Paris. There's a little street noise but the bedroom is perfectly quiet. The funky street ambience just adds to the Parisian experience. The shower pressure is excellent. The WiFi worked perfectly. After five days we were very sad to leave our little home away from home and would have no hesitation of booking there again.
32590665,489082527,2019-07-16,157980742,Alex,Great place overall. Not noisy. Location is great next to train though it's quite far from arc and tower. Host had Netflix which was great. Utensils were sufficient and complimentary tea was nice

De délicates attentions comme les petits oeufs déposés pour le voyageur puisque nous sommes en période Pascale. Le linge de toilette très bien présenté sur le lit. Et un lieu très propre. C'est petit mais très efficacement agencé .
6668175,274376679,2018-06-09,112504384,Bogdan,Great place for the money :)
21821176,343273930,2018-10-31,10264026,Lara,Loved the place - just as in the photos. Not much by way of amenities beyond soap but clean quiet and well-located. Beware though this is run through a brokerage company with automated communications - time-consuming and frustrating if you have any specific needs or requests at all. If you use AirBNB for the personalised interactions the commercialised approach will be disappointing.
13562524,474464306,2019-06-23,250151261,Ron,Future travelers can expect accommodations to be as advertised.

9342492,411935053,2019-02-14,46879294,Teresa,If you are looking for a silent and secure apartment with a very thoughtful and  delightful host this apartment is definitive worth to look at. We always look for cleanliness  peace and quiet plenty space for the 2 of us to work comfortable and easy access to all transport . After renting 3 other French Airbnb’s in the past  this is the only host who has left fresh flowers fruit  tea and biscuits for our arrival ... It was indeed a gesture we truly appreciated. The Eiffel Tower on your door step. The first class fresh food French Market on the corner( twice a week ) is a must for ‘foodies’  particularly as for our breakfast we like to be self sufficient. Short walk to Trocadero and the host always available for queries. We would not hesitate to book again . Thank you .

Nearby there are shops and a market with seafood.  You can walk to the main attractions of Paris: the Eiffile Tower the Louvre the Champs Elysees the Arc de Triomphe. Jacqueline is very nice and ready to help with any questions. We had a wonderful week in Paris!

25790429,328463351,2018-09-26,68532470,Nick,I hesitate to give such a glowing review for fear that I may not be able to book this property again in the future. A+ location in the heart of Le Marais close to every quintessential French restaurant cafe and boulangerie imaginable. Clement is a fantastic host very concerned with our happiness at the apartment and always ready with a suggestion for dining nightlife or general Paris tips. The apartment itself is beautifully and stylishly decorated and offered every amenity we expected coming from the US. Lots of space especially for a Parisian flat and very well done. Highly recommend!

Mehdi foi muito atencioso ele preparou uma pasta com instruções sobre o apartamento e dicas de Paris. Como ele estava viajando quem efetuou o check in e check out foi sua mãe que também foi muito gentil e pontual. 
A estadia foi ótima e sem dúvidas escolheria o apartamento numa próxima viagem a Paris. "

530324,37728308,2015-07-10,26872014,Nick,We spent 5 nights in Nicolas' apartment and it was perfect. It is located on a side street and at night is quiet. Being only a 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower was great. There are a number of supermarkets close by and there are so many places to eat within a short walking distance. The apartment is well stocked with everything you will need to cook a meal in if you like. Check in was so easy as the key was available with a code supplied before our arrival. This was ideal for us as we had no data or phone when we arrived in Paris and as it took us a while to navigate the train system for the first time it was good not to have to worry about meeting Nicolas at a certain time. Nicolas came and met us once we had arrived and gave tips about the local area. He was available during our stay if we needed anything and called in before we checked out to make sure we were happy with our stay. We would definately stay there again.

13144615,140488807,2017-03-30,56121015,Amber,Micheal and sylvie's apartment was just what we needed in an awesome location! Great bars and restaurants just around the corner walking distance to the louvre and notre dame and moulin rouge! Small and cute living space with a kitchen and little fridge and a fan- for anyone else who has troubles sleeping without one only downside was it is on the 5th floor (American). After walking an entire day those stairs were the absolute worst. However for the price and location you really cant beat It!

Mais ce qui fait de cet appartement un coup de coeur c'est sa déco et ses prestations ! Les photos sont bien représentatives. Il est propre et au calme avec la chambre donnant sur une petite cour. Isabelle est à l'écoute et la remise des clés s'est très bien déroulé. Bref je recommande vivement !"
8606572,50388109,2015-10-11,35220859,Jer,Très agréable week-end passé dans l'appartement de Caroline (pour les 20km de Paris). L'appartement bénéficie d'un emplacement de rêve à deux pas de la tour Eiffel avec même une vue sur la grande dame. Il est au calme ce qui est un vrai luxe à Paris. Les chambres sont spacieuses et les lits agréables. Caroline s'est révélée une hôte agréable et discrète à la fois attentive à ce que l'on se sente bien (pas de machine à café qu'elle s'est empressée d'aller acheter il y en a une maintenant) et à trouver des solutions à un ou deux soucis d'organisation initiaux vite résolus.

3558574,36795022,2015-07-01,32070517,Michael,"We had a great time in Paris the quartier latin where I used to live ages ago just down the street from Seymour's great place. This was despite the Taxi driver strike for which we had to rent  a car arriving at CDG the first day of the strike with three kids ... since this made us quite late I was so happy for Seymour to wait till we got to his place having to  fight through heavy trafic and blocked streets because of ""la greve"". He helped us with all the luggage up to his apartment (5th floor no elevator) and had a snack for us and the kids waiting and two cold beers for dad - that  really helped after a stressy day :-)
The place is great roomy for us with three smnall kids under 6 and there were even toys in the kids room - we left two frozen Helium baloons from Eurodisney for his kids to thank for the toys. The location can't be beat just a couple of blocks from either the Notre Dame Ile St. Lousi with Berthilion's ice cream and the rue Mouffetard. We had looked for a child friendly apartment in Paris and Seymour's place is precisely that. He was also very quick to help when I had problems with the lock. So thank's for all and sorry about the boken wine glass."

15489448,321724232,2018-09-11,39552420,Michael,Perfect location for a trip to Paris.  St Germain is a great place to explore and Maikel's apartment is at the center of what is hot in the neighborhood.  The place has charm and character and a beautiful courtyard that makes you feel right at home.  Check in was easy as well as checkout and the place was nice and clean.
21706718,304685104,2018-08-10,138976763,Cherry Lyn,We had an amazing time at Yassine's place! It is very close to Eiffel Tower so you can go there as often as you want no rush :) The place is clean contrary to what I've read in some reviews. Will definitely recommend!
13228542,356135878,2018-12-07,12038097,Joany,Great location!  Very clean small apartment in the 3 Arr. within walking distance to many popular spots.
728737,174599776,2017-07-26,123135948,Hannah,"The place is nice.. the pictures make it look bigger than it is. The location is good. The home is clean safe and that's great.
A few things went wrong during my stay. The person checking us in was a half hour late. The navigation on air bnb brought us to a home that was half a mine away from where it actually was. The television didn't work. The coffee machine takes special cups that you will have to buy a large case of because it isn't provided. 
These things weren't a big deal. The only thing that really bothered me was the host gave me a number to reach with questions or for help. After responding one or two times the person started completely ignoring me. Prune must be somewhere else because he either didn't respond to me or took hours. Nobody offered help with the television. It was okay but you shouldn't ignore your guests..."
23988565,429937961,2019-03-29,241021208,Patricia,Great little apartment with everything you might need. Location really worked for me as it was a relatively quite area but a short metro ride away from centre. I was travelling alone and I felt safe throughout my stay. I would recommend for a short stay. Both Stephan and Aurelie were helpful with my many questions :)
35516893,522531476,2019-09-02,274514218,Marília,The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6849340,257198224,2018-04-25,21327487,Ashten,Marie-Pascale was a terrific host! She was so thoughtful during our stay. When asking for directions she even went out of her way to draw a map for us so we wouldn't get lost our first day in Paris! I could not recommend her as a host more!
32696994,476539101,2019-06-26,265664435,Cindy,"Muslimat's instructions and responsiveness were excellent. The wifi worked great.  The location is convenient to a metro station and Eiffel tour.

The place is pretty much as you see it and in line with the price.  Meant for the budget traveler who expects to spend little time indoors and just needs a bed and bath.  It is equipped with the bare essentials.  No wine opener--which was odd for France.  It is small; I was a solo traveler and it was ok. I put my suitcase on the floor and had to walk around it.  It was clean enough.  The kitchen had a dirty sponge and rag.  That is why I gave it four stars on cleanliness.  Two bath towels were provided no hand towel for bath or kitchen.  

I was there during the heat wave in June.  The place does not have A/C and there is not much breeze via the window which faces the complex courtyard.  As such I only stayed one night as I was sweating just sitting in the room.  I ended up renting a hotel for the rest of my stay.  So my budget minded travel got rather expensive!  Overall  I would stay here again but not if over 75F 23C."

15448248,550632937,2019-10-19,201216766,Alison,"Thomas’s flat surpassed our expectations! It was bright clean cheerful spacious(for Paris) safe thoughtful and the location is amazing. It is literally right around the corner from place de Vosges which is lined with cafes and art stores. And if you walk the opposite direction you run into more cafes and restaurants and are not far from Marche des Enfant Rouge which is one of the best markets in Paris!

The other thing that stood out to me and my boyfriend were the little touches that made our stay so comfortable. The bed was so cozy with its multiple pillows and fluffy comforter. There was an easy to use coffee maker with coffee pods available for our use night stands and plugs for phone charger next to the bed and a beautiful closet system to hang our clothes during our stay! They may seem like simple things but these creature comforts can really make your stay more enjoyable. 

We can’t wait to stay here again and we wish we had spent our entire time in Paris at Thomas’s flat!"

The location of the flat is in residential area with some cafes shops near by. 
We are very grateful that our early check in was accommodated (with €17 charge). 
Flat looks slightly different from the pictures: sofa decorations light. This hasn’t affected comfort in anyway just we were expecting something slightly different. 
Overall we recommended the place to others who are looking for place for two in Paris."

14067272,248854763,2018-04-01,181354460,伟豪,good side location is great but the price that I was staying is around 70 euros per night not really worth that much as it's just a old mattress and sheet it is just a place to crash for a night not to enjoy. and for those who'd like to stay please read their descriptions carefully.

It is a bit far from the city center but the metro and bus stations are close to the flat so you can get to the main attractions in 20-30 minutes. There are restaurants and a supermarket nearby. Alex was really helpful and kind he answered all of our questions.

L’appartement possède les commodités essentielles et bénéficie surtout d’une localisation exceptionnelle pour nous qui avons crapahuté dans tout Paris. Le plus étant la vue sur la Tour Eiffel évidement !!! Je recommande cet appartement pour sa localisation et pour les familles avec enfant en bas âge notamment du fait du canapé lit limite pour  2 adultes a notre sens . Sinon RAS vous pouvez foncer

4930778,164662735,2017-06-28,87093636,Greer,This apartment was clean beautiful comfortable and the hosts were extremely friendly. We traveled with our two kids and upon arrival they had stocked the fridge with a couple of drinks and small yogurts. Very thoughtful! It's right across the street from a lovely park and not in the center of a bunch of touristy places. So it felt calmer than some of the areas we visited in the city. There are many restaurants just around the corner in several directions. We hope to return someday.

Week end parfait je vous remercie encore.
17618524,485234196,2019-07-10,247789043,Marley,O valor da diária está adequado. O apartamento é limpo possui um bom banheiro e um bom quarto. Infelizmente o prédio estava em reforma com muitos trabalhadores lixando pintando e usando máquinas muito barulhentas o que causou certo desconforto e nos deixou doentes por conta da poeira da reforma do prédio. O apartamento é ideal para um casal ou no máximo um casal com um filho pequeno enquanto para quatro pessoas não é assim tão perfeito mas para quem não se importa muito com falta de espaço dá pra dormir no sofá da sala tranquilamente. Para melhorar deveria adicionar mais um ventilador para os dias de calor (há apenas 2) e um forno para o preparo de refeições rápidas; há fogão elétrico e microondas; havia toalhas de banho para apenas três pessoas e não para 4 e como estávamos em 4 tivemos que dividir as toalhas. Ponto negativo foi a ausência de cortina no banheiro que possui uma grande janela voltada para a rua. Resolvemos isto de forma improvisada retirando a cortina do quarto e transferindo-a provisoriamente para o banheiro. Nossa família gostou muito do apartamento e da localização voltaríamos com prazer a alugar o espaço da Bettina em uma nova oportunidade e indicamos o lugar a todos que queiram um bom espaço em Paris pois é seguro próximo aos pontos turísticos e corresponde fielmente às fotos do Airbnb. Abraços Bettina. Obrigado.
11498629,225638713,2018-01-07,89804448,Miguel,"Jean-François apartment is great. It's in a cheap zone of Paris but very close to the metro and bus. It also has a lot of supermarkets and restaurants nearby. The bed is really comfy and it was very clean. 

The main drawbacks are that it is a third floor with no lift and that the lady that welcomed us only speaks French so it was a bit difficult to communicate with her.

Overall a great experience and we'd definitely repeat at Jean-François' place"

12499846,261365794,2018-05-06,184506582,Wade,Marie-Loup was an amazing host always getting back to us quickly and providing us with all the info we needed. Her place was clean tidy and very chic in decoration. The balcony provides an amazing view of the Eiffel tower which is only a 15 minute walk away. The area has everything including shops cafes restaurants kiosks clothing stores and supermarkets (there was also a farm market out front on Sunday morning). We felt extremely safe in this area and the people couldn't have been nicer. The train station is right out front but we found ourselves walking everywhere. Our stay in Paris was amazing thanks to Marie-Loup and her studio suite. Would highly recommend
11649493,533781726,2019-09-22,19058568,Ben,"The flat is a great space located within walking distance to many of Paris' great attractions. 

The neighbourhood itself has a lot of cool restaurants and bars so no need to travel and our hosts made us feel very welcome even allowing us to stay late into our departure day. We had a wonderful stay and would visit again."

549295,481726202,2019-07-05,47531394,Cécile,La chambre et les draps étaient propres. Les toilettes et les douches n'était pas nettoyés chaque jour.... robinets dévissés et bonde de lavabo coincée. Poubelles qui débordent devant l'entrée. Réfrigérateur sale je n'y aurai pas stocké ma nourriture... Prévoyez les bouchons d'oreilles pour la nuit car les murs et les portes ne sont pas insonorisés.

The apartment is spacious lovely and well equipped as advertised. It is located in a very beautiful building in a wonderful neighborhood as Montmartre close to the Metro restaurants and shops to buy all sorts of food. I definetly recommend Charlotte's apartment and hope to go back.

15533132,485580986,2019-07-11,90964125,Lisa,This was our family of 5’s first trip to Paris and Philippe’s flat was the perfect home away from home for our stay.  Close to every type of eatery (including some amazing Patisseries) with a grocery store literally on the same street and a few minutes walk to the Metro this flat has it all!!  Philippe was out of town when we arrived but when he came back the next day he went out of his way to stop by and check that all of our questions were answered and that we had everything we needed.  Unfortunately our airline lost 3 of our 5 suitcases but luckily Philippe helped us navigate even going so far as to talk to the airline and luggage delivery service in French for us a few times!!!  The flat itself is cozy and had all needed amenities :-)

16627409,161671148,2017-06-18,71908647,John,"I stayed at Camila's while visiting the Université Paris-Dauphine for work. It is conveniently located - everything you might need within a few minutes walk and close to Metro stations bringing you swiftly and cheaply to the city centre and a stop for Le Bus Direct to and from the airports.
For an apartment of its size it has everything you might hope for. The bed is comfortable the cooking facilities were good and the view is a delight. The elevator is great to have after a long day in the city but be aware that it stops one floor short of the apartment. If you have mobility difficulties this is not for you.
An excellent stay in every respect."

3729680,19638989,2014-09-15,5863516,Anas,"Catherine's apartment is a wonderful place to enjoy Paris. 

We felt very cosy : the interior is charming with a comfortable bedroom and a useful bathroom. We also had a good communication with Catherine's son Alexandre who was very flexible for the check-in/out. Thanks for the champagne btw ;-)

The flat is located in a beautiful neighborhood. You'll find anything you need; from a typical pastry shop to a tasty restaurant. It's also a great spot to start a walk into Paris (Pompidou Notre Dame la Seine le Louvre Saint Germain and many other cute streets and places).

We recommend!"

4407168,434669835,2019-04-08,13442448,Timea,"We had a mixed but rather positive stay in Amélie’s studio eventually. It did’t started well because we could barely sleep due to the noise the neighbors made in the first two nights. The first night Amélie handled the situation professionally and called the neighbors immediately which solved the issue. However on the second night when I wrote her at midnight her response was „it is Friday night” and „they will end soon if not you could knock the door” (the music from one neighbor and the clamor from the other). I will let you decide whether this solution was appropriate or not. All these were especially annoying after Amélie wrote 2-3 times in her welcome letter that the building is very quiet and they have strict rules and be quite after 10PM and even asked us not to roll our suitcases on the corridor. Anyway this building is anything but quiet as you can hear people even to walk the stairs in the staircase. 

Except this we liked the studio. It is small but well equipped and perfectly enough for two people. All the previous comments about the studio’s condition are true: there is mould on the wall by the shower and the studio could bear a renovation (and sound-proofing!) but I think you can deal with it for some days. Cleanliness could be better. The towels were rather hand towels so be prepared and bring yours if you prefer a normal size towel. The location was just perfect I doubt that you can find a better placed studio for the same price. 

All in all it’s a good choice if you can sleep in any noise otherwise you should avoid this studio (ear plugs do not help)."

En effet il nous a contacté quelques jours avant notre arrivée pour savoir si nous avions des besoins particuliers pour ce weekend. A notre arrivée Sidney nous a accueilli chaleureusement et nous a fait visiter l'appartement en nous donnant toutes les explications nécessaires. L'appartement est confortable spacieux et joliment décoré. Il correspond bien à la description faite sur le site. Il est idéalement situé à deux pas de l'Arc de Triomphe et des Champs Elysés. Sidney nous a spécifié qu'il était joignable pendant notre séjour si un problème se présentait. Pour un prochain séjour sur Paris je n'hésiterais pas à retourner chez Sidney. Je vais me répéter mais l'accueil était vraiment d'une grande cordialité.

6802187,59035004,2016-01-06,43684550,Romina,Host gentilissimo e disponibilissimo appartamento in posizione fantastica ma credo non sia corretto non scrivere che oltre a non esserci l'ascensore e' al sesto piano con scale dissestate e tipo chiocciola. Per fortuna non avevamo bambini piccoli o persone con handicap altrimenti sarebbe stato inaccessibile. 
11780110,454031602,2019-05-17,100696558,Mala,This is a large and comfortable flat in an excellent area.  The patio with plants was a nice bonus of green  space.

493269,104752169,2016-09-28,42454924,Masood,"I had a great experience staying at Alexandre's apartment and would readily recommend it. The apartment is spacious well-furnished clean and located in a fantastic neighborhood. Alexandre is easy to contact and responds quickly. His father waited for us to arrive from the airport and helped us upstairs. The place looks like it's kept for Airbnb use and not a personal living space that is occasionally rented out--which I greatly prefer.

The location is my favorite part of the apartment. It's just the best."

Il lavandino del bagno minuscolo ma bella doccia.

The host wasn't flexible for the check in time and we have not met him all the advices he gave us was through Airbnb's inbox. He had no towels for all the people he hosted while he knew we would be 3. We are not sure if the sheets were clean the fridge smelled awful and the place was full of his own things. If you can take with you sheets and towels and you are not a cleanliness freak the apartment is nice.

7771595,97625136,2016-08-28,37956133,Lucie,Nous avons réservés ce logement pour nos parents. Leur commentaire aurait pu être plutôt positif malgré quelques désagréments (douche très petite pas de serviettes pour les mains cheveux et poils dans la douche et le lavabo et tâches sur le protège matelas) mais correct pour deux nuits. Sauf que l'hôte nous réclame de l'argent pour une housse de clic clac soit disant tâchée (mes parents n'ont jamais mangés dans le logement et ont bien déposé la housse sur une chaise pour la protéger) et un ventilateur cassé (il fonctionnait très bien à leur départ). Apparemment Aribnb est un vrai commerce pour certaines personnes... J'attends le retour du site concernant ce litige.
3477049,524134763,2019-09-05,223414006,Anna,The view in pictures does NOT do it justice the most amazing view I’ve ever seen. So worth the climb (which is six flights a little bit crazy with lots of luggage). It was a really nice stay. The only thing was the bathroom being a bit small but we were out walking around for most of the day. There’s an amazing market outside the building and sooo many places to walk to. In a great location.
25759266,501086344,2019-08-03,95450204,Adrian,Alice's place is perfectly situated and within quick walking distances of several metro stops. When we arrived Alice was there to greet us and provided incredibly helpful explanations about how to enter and exit the building at night and she was quick to communicate whenever we had logistical questions. There were thoughtful touches throughout the apartment including a delicious bottle of complimentary Bordeaux wine and fresh fruits. The portable AC unit came in handy during our stay and we appreciate Alice providing that amenity to guests in a city where air conditioning can be hard to come by.

35954634,550752461,2019-10-19,52745479,Valeria,Siamo stati a casa di Gianni per 8 notti e siamo davvero stati bene. Partivamo la mattina presto per tornare la sera e ogni volta era come tornare a casa perché l’ambiente è molto ospitale curato confortevole. Letto comodissimo vista spettacolare sui tetti e sulla Tour Eiffel due coccole in più che hanno reso speciale il nostro soggiorno. La casa ha tutti gli accessori necessari Gianni è un host molto attento e molto facilmente contattabile per ogni evenienza. Zona molto carina e piena di ristorantini e altri locali la casa è a tre minuti al max dalla fermata metro Goncourt. Mi spaventavano le tante scale ma non hanno pesato minimamente sul giudizio complessivo anzi ottime per smaltire le cene e ultimo sforzo prima del meritato riposo. Se dovessimo tornare a Parigi non esiteremmo a tornare qua :)

1717639,29297800,2015-04-06,28716803,Revathi,"Thibaud is a very friendly and helpful host. The place was a artful and cosy studio room and very neat with all the required amenities. When we arrived the weather was really chilly and it was really nice of thibaud to have all the heating equipment up and running.  Though the place is little far off from the main tourist attractions of paris the city metro network is quite good and hence it is of no problem. Overall we enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to check his place. 
PS : Thibaud is a good photographer also .. and i personally liked the way he gave his personal photography touch to the house. "

Stephane's flat is in a perfect location - walking distance to small shops bakeries wonderful local restaurants.  The flat itself is extremely clean modern and comes with all you'll need to have a perfect stay in the city. The Metro stop is less than a block away and is the perfect way to go visit the main tourist spots. We actually walked over to Notre Dame. 

Stephane was an extremely gracious host. He gave us a detailed overview of the many amenities of his flat and then gave us a perfect recommendation for a local restaurant. We visited twice and can't believe the awesome experience we had. 

We'll definitely be back!"

Communication was good. The flat itself is absolutely lovely the decoration is nice and makes you feel quite at home in a foreign city. The location is good too close to metro stops that will take you closer to the city centre super markets and cafés. Overall I can highly recommend Charlotte's flat as the basis for your visit to Paris.

The advertisement is really accurate with a few extra touches (like a bottle of wine and extra amenities) which make it even nicer. The location is superb with great access to public transport local shops and a view to Basilique du Sacré Cœur. Also the communication was quick and smooth so thank you Kevin for being a great host!

It's beautifully designed very unique in a really great and very central location and it has everything you could possibly need and more. Plus it's very quiet. I would definitely stay here again and loved everything about the apartment. The photos on Air B&B do not do it justice. It's very comfortable with great beds a fully equipped kitchen and it's SO quiet. The location could not be beaten and it's easy walking distance to many of the top sites in Paris whilst the local neighbourhood is full of amazing shops cafes and places to eat. It's also 5 minutes walk to two metro stations. Isabelle was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. What more can I say? Do stay here if you can you won't regret it!

783294,7779191,2013-10-02,8821140,Tom,We had a wonderful time in Paris at Cyril's apartment. Yes there are stairs...but the apartment's central location in the Marais and ease to the subways make up for it.  Additionally we really enjoyed the local farmer's market located right around the corner where you can eat breakfast lunch and dinner as well as shop for fresh produce. There is also a great wine store at the end of the street and two wonderful bakeries. The washing machine located just outside the apartment was also a nice bonus. We have been to Paris numerous times and wanted to try staying in an apartment instead of the hotels. We found Cyril's apartment to be clean and comfortable well worth the money. I found the only drawback to be the lack of extra towels in the apartment an easy fix.

32589437,558675349,2019-11-03,178837317,Erin,"WOW. Olric’s space is absolutely charming. It is his home and it is apparent that he loves it. Everything is comfortable from the sofa and delicious antique armchairs to the bed and bedding. The space functions beautifully. Olric saved us— our first Airbnb turned out to be in a very dangerous part of town where we felt really unsafe (this is saying a lot— we have both lived in big cities all over the world for the past 30 years). In a panic I searched Airbnb to find a new place to stay and Olric not only agreed to host us a the last minute he also let us check out late on our final day. 

The neighbourhood is perfect— lots of restaurants bakeries shops. Bustling and bright but the apartment is quiet and peaceful. We felt safe and at home in this lovely little slice of heaven tucked under the rooftops of Paris. 

We cannot thank Olric enough for his flexibility in accommodating us and we hope to return to his beautiful flat the next time we are in Paris. (If ever you want to sell Olric see me first!)

13078573,80271778,2016-06-17,73235756,Alfonso,Nuestra experiencia fue muy buena. Si bien sólo usamos el apartamento para dormir el mismo estaba muy limpio la ducha excelente y el dormitorio muy ordenado. Joseph es un muy buen anfitrion y habla muy bien inglés (es traductor) Se ofreció para que dejemos las valijas en su dormitorio antes del horario de ingreso y posterior a la salida para no cargar con las mismas por París innecesariamente. El apto está muy bien ubicado muy cerca de la zona principal de París. Tiene un supermercado muy bueno a 20 metros en el cual nosotros comprábamos el desayuno de paso. Lo recomiendo.

All facilities here are convenient. So if you were planning your trip to Paris it is the place that deserves your consideration.
By the way it is a shame for me (as a plant scientist I am :P) that I could not give any advice on how to take care of  your beautiful plastic flowers. I hope next time I could.    "
23107504,460399234,2019-05-29,117866645,Alexis,Great location and nice apartment for a single or couple traveling to Paris.  There was an issue with questionable stains on the couch cushions/pillows.  Also the door handle broke off as soon as I tried to close it.  A little more attention to detail would have solved these issues before check in.  The team was quick to respond but unable to fix the issues during my stay.

It is a great overall location for the Paris marathon as the route is on Rue Saint Antoine and you can watch the marathon from the apartment.  Julia was a great host and we would highly recommend this apartment to others for their stay in Paris.
13291021,232771085,2018-02-06,13358158,Kelton,The apartment is much smaller than it looks in the photos (too small for 4 people). The location is very good very close to the Louvre subway and shops. Very clean and the kitchen well equipped. Unfortunately we had some problems. We could not sleep well during the night because of the noise of the people above nor to bathe with hot water since it lasted 5 minutes warm and then it got cold and as we were 4 only one person could take a hot shower which was a little annoying in winter. Also since we did not speak French it was a bit difficult to communicate with the hostess. She already knew that we did not speak French but didn't try to explain anything to us and didn't answer our messages during the stay.

9690447,58203251,2016-01-01,51329523,Terry,Apartment is as advertised. It is an older building though but that's what also makes it cool. Great location easy access to public transportation quiet street safe neighbourhood and building. The host was honest and friendly and gave us all kinds of information about the neighbourhood and places that we might need. Although it is small it was fine for both of us and it had everything needed for a comfortable stay. Could have been a bit cleaner in some of the corners and a shower curtain would be a nice  addition around the tub. Overall we had a great stay and would ask to come back again. It's a fantastic price for Paris too!

The place was  clean & big enough for us (3 adults & 2 kids). Facilities were basic but good. Great shower & comfortable beds.  Kitchen was just a bench - sink & hob -place was pretty much as in the pictures.
A little humid but fans were provided to help with this.
Good value - thanks Kuen"
9182663,81386889,2016-06-22,60979682,Маrina,"We absolutely loved staying at Marine's apartment! It was our first time doing Airbnb as well as first time in Paris and we could not be any happier. It was very well kept and had all the essentials to make it feel like a home. The street was quite and very close to local shops and the metro. (Several Bakeries to choose from and fresh orange juice every day was amazing!) 
We opted to stay In the area for a couple days on our trip instead of going to see the main attractions of Paris and we were not short of any activities. A short walk will take you to the quaint bercy village (we wish we went sooner) or to the local park where you can rent a row boat.
Marine was very helpful and kind as well as accommodating. She was out of town during our stay but was very welcoming upon our arrival and replied to any questions we had almost instantly. 
We really loved this apartment and would definitely stay here again."
1137096,24657049,2015-01-01,23851848,Robert,"We had a great time staying at Sophie's roomy homey 3-bedroom apartment in the Charonne/Voltaire neighborhood. The apartment was exactly as advertised with a fully stocked kitchen a large living/dining room a washer/dryer combination and 3 separate bedrooms. The Charonne metro station was very close (less than a five-minute walk) which makes the apartment super convenient for quick excursions to anywhere you might want to go. Also very close are a number of bakeries butcher shops and supermarkets in addition to a wide variety of great restaurants.

Sophie was very responsive helpful and just plain friendly from the first inquiry to our last day at the apartment. It's difficult to suggest anything she could have done differently. I couldn't recommend her or the apartment any more highly."

The washing machine is very good and all kitchen needs were available (apart from a toaster which we survived without). The rest of the amenities were great. There was a fan there which was really needed as it was very hot and humid during our stay. 
There is only a sofa bed which you need to convert back to a sofa during the day in order to have room. It is very close to metro stations and supermarkets. We can recommend an excellent restaurant Le Café du Commerce right next to the Commerce metro quite close. Overall a good place to stay. "

2162251,37328204,2015-07-06,34055931,David,"We were excited to arrive in Paris our first time back in years.  This time we were with our daughter arriving from the UK. 
The good news - The location was nice around the corner from the Bristol Hotel.  The entrance was clean and secure.  The unit was as pictured in the listing.  
Now the bad - We are from Florida and know hot weather.  We knew in advance to book an apartment that had Air Conditioning.  Upon arrival the apartment seemed hot. The owner’s brother who met us warned us about issues with the AC. He told us to keep the bathroom door closed the bedroom door open and the shades closed in the main room etc.  We suspected there was a problem and found it upon our returned that night. The apartment was hotter inside than Paris was outside.
We contacted the owner’s brother and he wanted no part of it and told us to contact the owner. That’s when denial set in. The owner Patrick tried to explain away the broken AC instead of dealing with it.  He told that Paris was in a heat wave that 99% of the apartments in Paris don’t have AC that there is nothing wrong with the AC all the while we were sweating and uncomfortable.  We sent pictures and video to show him there was NO airflow. He finally agreed to have a repairman come out on the weekend which became Monday the day we were leaving and finally he confessed to us no one would be out until Wednesday!  WE WERE STRANDED IN A HOT SWEATY MESS.  Nowhere else we went in Paris had AC problems except our apartment!
We asked for some consideration like moving into one of the owner’s other units or some type of discount. We got NONE.  My wife was only comfortable keeping cool using the ice cube trays from the freezer.  Our daughter was so uncomfortable she went back to London.  The broken AC and lack of consideration on the Patrick’s part ruined our trip to Paris.

35065,945638,2012-02-24,1615184,Treesa,Great Flat Great Location! This is so handy to everything you need to fully enjoy your Paris trip. With a Metro stop literally steps away to markets bakeries and coffee shops within 1 or 2 blocks you can't go wrong. You can occasionally feel the  rumble (from the Metro) or hear street noise so if you are a light sleeper you'd want to bring some ear plugs. Otherwise I can't imagine a better location. We plan to be back!

6076911,442432371,2019-04-23,12509480,Michael,"Die Wohnung hat eine perfekte Lage. Mann kann zu vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten laufen. Das Viertel ist sehr schön und es gibt unzählige Restaurants. Die Wohnung ist in einem Altbau und hat einen schönen Flair mit tollen alten Möbeln.
Einzig die Sauberkeit war ein Problem wobei der Vermieter sich bemüht hat die Missstände zu beseitigen. Mit dem Auto ist die Wohnung nicht sehr praktisch da keine Parkplätze und sehr schwer zu finden."
6679230,182341963,2017-08-14,30107743,Ricky J.,"This was a wonderful apartment. Veronique and her colleagues were extremely helpful from the day I first arrived up through the sad day in which I had to return home to the United States. Everything was as advertised and more--it was clean bright beautiful spacious and comfortable. 

This apartment was located perfectly in the 5th Arrondissement close to everything and a few steps away from the Cardinal Lemoine (Line 10) metro station. If I could I would come back here to this very apartment every year for the rest of time. It's so secure from top to bottom!

It's very expensive yes but for some occasions perhaps that's necessary. The price is the only downer. In a perfect world it's much cheaper but I imagine that's life. But here's what I know: I'm thankful for the opportunity to live here during my stay in Paris and I'd love to come back again someday.

Thank you for opening your door to me Veronique."

He provided us with all the practical information needed and even met my group at the metro that is located like 400m from the flat. The neighbourhood at first seems to be unsafe but we didn't have any problem there. You can find everything you might need nearby from supermarkets to nice bars.  Bojan even provided us with a brazilian breakfast that we weren't expecting. :D
Thanks for everything."

Close to restaurants and the main artists square in Montmartre! The best thing about the apartment are the amazing views... the whole city and the Eiffel Tower from the living space and an extremely close up view of the sacre coeur from bedroom!! The bed was b comfortable and apartment well furnished with everything we needed! Clemente was great at giving us tips and staying in touch. I would note that the apartment is in the eaves and as such getting in and out of the bath can be a little difficult if tall so just be aware. Also the shower is hand held so you have to be careful otherwise can make the bathroom v wet!  All in all this was a great apartment and we will never forget looking out over Paris as the sun sets! "

2665755,16624421,2014-07-30,17514031,Victoria,My Daughter and I enjoyed our stay in Sophie's beautiful apartment. She kindly came to the train station when we arrived to get us when the metro stopped running. The closest station is conveniently right at the end of the street and there is an ATM right across the street. The security is very good with an electric outer door and intercom. Sophie kept in touch with us to make sure we were getting on well; as this was our first trip to Paris and we don't speak French.  Sophie is a wonderful host and her apartment is cleancomfortable and well appointed. I would recommend it to anyone.

The price is fantastic for location and charm!!
8251470,125705482,2017-01-07,94535159,Nancy,"We just arrived home after a wonderful stay at Myra's apartment and I have to say we were very happy with our choice. This apartment has all of the character you would like in a nice Parisian apartment in a lovely part of the city. It was a very short walk to shopping and the Metro. My family of four adults was very comfortable.

It was quite cold in Paris while we were there and we had a little trouble keeping the living room warm. After contacting Myra and our greeter Victoria the problem was solved immediately. We were very impressed with their responsiveness. 

We would highly recommend this apartment and hated to have to leave it!

Thank you to both Myra and Victoria!"
796422,463929397,2019-06-04,159310690,Sandeep,The stay at this place was far better than I thought. The place was well kept and sparkling clean. It is small in size which cannot be guessed from the photos. But is sufficient for two. May be they should mention square feet area in the description. But location wise it is in the middle of Paris and is very convenient to get around the whole city. Cem is a wonderful host. And I would definitely come back to his place next time.
8663931,69201214,2016-04-10,29021205,Rob,Realy nice and cosy apartment in beautiful neighborhood. Very close to the underground station.
32927838,483205865,2019-07-07,178545337,Darlene,Pierre’s home is located in a great area but the home is not very clean or as described on Airbnb. The carpet Is heavily soiled and smells like urine. The toilet area has the walls falling apart and plaster falling apart and smelled. The bed is very old and very very uncomfortable. The wallpaper is coming off the walls it is very run down. With some updates and care this would be a fabulous place.

13308703,136197045,2017-03-09,53567195,Nydia,This apartments was awesome! You are literally a street away from the Eiffel Tower and get views of it when you age walking outside of the apartment. There are many shops on the street where the apartment is at. Mehdi and his wife Pauline were great. They were very responsive to all my questions and the instructions to reach the apartment were very clear. The apartment it self was very cool. Has plenty of space for two people. The only bad thing was that there is a restaurant right next door so it could be very loud I am not sure it extends to above the apartment but you could hear people walking almost all night. But it didn't bother us too much because being on the first floor it's expected you will head the people above. We had a great stay in Paris and would definitely  recommend staying here. 
6175543,68252681,2016-04-03,51557980,Paul,Decent host and location. The apartment is well equipped and closely located to metro station with lots of restaurants nearby.

29044948,364784466,2018-12-31,235429,Marta,Molt bona ubicació. En general molt net tot i que el bany no feia gaire bona olor suposo que per les canyeries antigues de la finca. Les escales per accedir al pis estan en bastant mal estat i poden ser perilloses per pujar i baixar molt carregats o pels nens petits però l’apartament està molt bé i té tot el que puguis necessitar per a una curta estada a Paris.

Die Lage der Wohnung ist am Rande eines recht ""proletarischen"" und von Einwanderern geprägten Gegend aber dadurch gerade interessant. Es gab keine Störungen durch Nachbarn alles sehr ruhig. Die Einführung zur Benutzung der Wohnung durch einen Beauftragten war ausreichend. Betreut oder unterstützt wurden wir vom Gastgeber bzw. deren Beauftragten persönlich sonst nicht war für uns aber nicht so wichtig war. Wir können die Wohnung sehr empfehlen!"

17275720,513390387,2019-08-19,24377893,Nick,We stayed here through a cool period in the heart of vacation season in Paris.  The views of the Eiffel Tower were great and the proximity to La Motte Picquet Grennelle metro station was very convenient.  Unfortunately a lot of restaurants were closed in this Arrondissement while we were here so we consistently found ourselves traveling to the first and fifth arrondissement. The apartment was very clean and the beds were comfortable.  You will get your flights of stairs in - prepare yourself for the 8 flights of stairs in the dark at night on a small windy wooden staircase - the first floor is the American second floor. Worth it overall though.

The apartment is very bright and clean and is on the fourth floor in a building which is accessed from a courtyard and has an elevator.  You will need to bring your own dishwashing liquid and laundry soap as the host has advised they do not provide these.
4562960,499967892,2019-08-01,134700489,Rhona,My daughter and I spent nine days at Natalie's apartment and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It's a warm comfortable clean very stylish apartment with all the amenities of home. We appreciated the well-stocked kitchen dishwasher and especially the washer-dryer as well as the comfortable beds and great shower. This charming apartment is located in an especially lively part of Paris that is well situated for reaching all the major sightseeing areas either by walking or through the several metro stops in the vicinity. We took several day trips from Gare du Nord and it was only a few quick stops from the Republique metro. We also found several great markets and boulangeries in the area and especially enjoyed people watching on place du Republique where there was always something interesting going on - whether it was a pop-up salsa dancing event or skateboarding. This apartment was a fantastic find and we hope to come back someday with our whole family. Merci beaucoup Natalie!
10169600,127119646,2017-01-16,94656815,Fabiana,La ubicación es muy buena y su anfitrión es muy atento y agradable. Lamentablemente hay que subir muchos pisos por escalera para llegar
859972,17053672,2014-08-06,2197258,Iris,Etienne made us feel very welcome! He is a great person and loves to make you feel at home. He even made us some french breakfast. But he also respects your privacy. The room and the apartment are exactly as on the pictures and the view from both the apartment as the bedroom is incredible (you see the Sacre Coeur from your bedroom)! Everything is very clean and the bed is really comfortable even better than in a hotel. The apartment and the building really give you a feeling of how Parisians life. The neighborhood is lively at the end of the street you have a Velib-station and the metro station Grands Boulevards (which is close to everything). But the Grand Boulevards are also nice to wander around and the beautiful street Rue Montorgueil (with french bars/speciality shops) is also within walking distance. All together I would definitely recommend to stay at Etienne's place. Thanks a lot again Etienne!

Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und die Umgebung war schon etwas abgelegen aber man hatte seine Ruhe mit einem wunderschönen Blick auf Paris. Trotzdem könnte man öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sehr schnell und gut erreichen. 
Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen!"

Die Umgebung perfekt edel zentral. Berthillon Eis war super gleich um die Ecke und das Orangerie Restaurant um die Ecke war echt Französisch. Beim Schiffsdeck auf der anderen Seite der Brücke war immer was los man brauchte gar nicht weit zum Ausgehen man hatte alles was das Herz begehrt in und vor der Haustüre. Sehr schönes Appartement mit viel Liebe zum Detail.
7187934,50199296,2015-10-10,43841809,Frances,Cecilia was the first Parisian paul and I met when we arrived in Paris for our first trip and she was absolutely delightful. The apartment was fabulous and cecila had catered for our every need.  We felt very welcome and comfortable as coming all the way from Australia was a long trip and Paris a very different environment / vibe from home.

The sofa bed is very comfortable and folds up so easily so you have space in the apartment during the day. You will not regret the area. Quiet yet close to everything. Be sure to rent a bike right outside the apartment. First half hour is free! Ride down along the Seine and enjoy a cold glass of wine or beer. There's toilets and fresh cold water everywhere there. You can ride all the way to the Jardin de Tulleries and even continue to the Eiffel Tower. Enjoy!

587868,47460736,2015-09-19,843992,Anna,"Such a wonderful home full of interesting objects and that beautiful stained glass! There were 8 of us in our group including two small children (who loved the toys and books!) and every one of us had a fantastic stay. Emmanuelle made our arrival very easy and was there to welcome us and make sure we got settled in. She also provided an extremely helpful list of local shops and restaurants.

The location was perfect - a short walk to Sacre Coeur 5-10 minutes to Chateau Rouge metro (the one we used the most although I think there's one nearer?) and despite being next to a junction we all slept very well. I'd definitely recommend Emmanuelle's apartment for a family group visiting Paris."
15806644,158378409,2017-06-06,91375647,Jessica,Beautiful luxurious room. Worth the price for a nice getaway within a 20 min walk from the Arc de Triomphe 40 from Eiffel Tower metro close by and several lovely eateries.

13229230,304701086,2018-08-10,502639,Mitra,We loved the location. We hated how dirty the place was there was built up soap scum and grime in the shower and the toilet was dirty. There was layers of dust everywhere and the floors had dust in every corner. I actually found some disinfectant and scrubbed the shower as best I could before using it. We felt uncomfortable about the dirt our entire stay. I hope the host gets the place properly cleaned before letting it out again yuk.

4478240,250728203,2018-04-06,76012212,Erik,Catherine’s charming Parisian apartment is ideally located for anyone who wants to explore the city from a great base camp. There are fantastic restaurants and shops all over the neighborhood including one on the ground floor of Catherine’s building.  The apartment is walking distance from the RER stop for easy access to and from the airport (no taxi needed).  It’s also walking distance to many of the city’s most famous sites like Notre Dame and the Luxembourg Gardens. The area is lively during the day and quiet by night.  We had a great experience.

She cares a lot about her place and it shows! She was very hospitable and met us at the flat and talked with us and showed us places on our map where she recommended. We enjoyed our stay very much. This flat is a relaxing escape after walking around Paris all day. 
14252019,201332733,2017-10-08,11004732,Nick,The room is exactly as advertised. Very clean and in a superb location next to bars restauranrs trains buses and shopping. I am particularly picky about cleanliness and Thierry did a great job of keeping the rooms clean and ensuring that they are stocked with essential items (e.g. toilet paper paper towels etc). The washer/dryer is a good as well however note that it is outside of the room and it will take some time to dry (as expected of all in one machines). One last thing to note is that there is no look hole in the door (so you can see who rings the bell). There is a monitor outside to see the hallway but you cannot see who is ringing your own doorbell. That is a small item that shouldn’t deter you from staying with Thierry though. His apartment was great and he always responds quickly! Thanks for everything!
2143577,291025218,2018-07-15,137746090,Guanglin,Phi and Marie are awesome hosts. They are extremely friendly and nice. The room I stayed has very unique design and I really love it.

El apartamento estaba a lado pero tardamos en dar con él.  Las instrucciones del lugar donde nos dejaba la llave también eran incorrectas. Tardamos horas en dar con el apartamento y las llaves. No nos cogía el telefono.
Una vez encontrado cual fue nuestra sorpresa al entrar y ver que estaba sin hacer de los interiores huéspedes. Las sabanas usadas papeleras llenas baño sucio  sin papel higienico....etc. Una experiencia desagradable. La limpieza la tuvimos que hacer nosotros.
Sin comentarios....."

We would definitely stay in one of Ludovic's apartments again! Thanks!

We did not spend much time there but it was great to be able to come back and relax in such a spacious apartment in a great location very close to two metro stops. We did not meet Genie herself but she was in regular text contact to make sure everything was alright and we did not need anything. She sent helpful notes in advance about the apartment and ideas for things to do in Paris. All in all a great experience which we would happily repeat.

C’est aussi tout près du Jardin des plantes un grand parc idéal pour les coureurs. Bien que nous n’avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer Margaux elle a été très sympathique et a répondu à toutes nos questions.

32082,14727343,2014-06-25,9864042,David,"There is a good reason that there are so many positive comments about the apartment in the Bastille. Michel is passionate about Paris and welcoming guests. We managed to get ourselves lost getting to the apartment. I need to say it is not hard to find the apartment we made an error in map reading. Michel came to our rescue gave a full introduction to the apartment and then took us on a tour of the neighbourhood. When we came to leave Michel likewise showed us where to get the bus to the airport an easy walk from the apartment.
The apartment had everything we needed was well laid out and spacious. 

It was a short walk to the metro at Bastille although on our first day we comfortably walked to Notre Dame and on another occasion walked back through the Marias. There are plenty of great places to eat within a few minutes walk. There is a copy of 50 walks in Paris and using this was an excellent way to explore.

We would happily stay here again."

9233242,271706692,2018-06-02,54424664,Kaleb,Elie’s place is great. It is a little smaller than you think it is from the pictures but size is made up for by efficiency. Elie has the place organized to the limit! It was amazing. The place is just about a 20-30 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower which was perfect. It was surrounded by plenty of shops to stop in and pick up food. Elie provided breakfast as well! He thought of everything. I would highly recommend this space.

37456684,527638502,2019-09-11,194651242,Sacha,Tout avait l'air bien malgré quelques manques d'équipement (sèche-cheveux et kit de repassage) je ne peux pas juger au final car un dégât des eaux a conduit à l'annulation de ma réservation par l'hôte.
14498129,124179656,2017-01-01,44397772,Stephanie,L'appartement était tout à fait conforme à la description et aux photos. Très bel appartement agréable à vivre. La communication avec Victor a été très facile et précise. Je recommande vivement . 
24461413,333421538,2018-10-07,194288836,Anna-Maria,"Daniele's place is in the 14th. It is a cosy little flat comfortable for two people and close to the tram and metro for an easy access to the city attractions. We felt like we were a part of the neighborhood with nearby boulangeries grocery stores markets parks and restaurants.
The flat had everything we needed for comfortable living. Nicolas was very accessible and responsive to all of our questions and requests and even met with us for coffee. We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this host."
25024817,285688552,2018-07-04,197499445,Patrick,Very friendly host for a perfectly located apartment - very clean and well equipped. Nice restaurants in near vicinity with very good connection to all monuments. Would book the apartment for the next Paris trip again.

7388139,250478159,2018-04-05,50729502,Maria,Solo hay una cama el sofá cama y el futón son de la misma mala calidad es un colchón de menos de  10 cm sin muelles sobre el suelo. Todo se reduce a una habitación aunque las fotos están hechas de diversas perspectivas y parecen diferentes habitaciones no lo son. El propietario no apareció ni al llegar ni al salir dejo las llaves en la recepción del edificio y se las devolvimos al chico que envío para limpiar el apartamento cuando nos íbamos. No hay ni un espacio para poder dejar tus cosas colgar algo de ropa o sencillamente sacar algo de la maleta. Nunca me había encontrado comida en la nevera o los armarios del propietario llenos.
1947121,484555498,2019-07-09,7505957,Lisa,Our stay at Josephine's apartment was just great.

5213447,347897931,2018-11-12,48063128,Rodrigo,David is a very kind and friendly host. Unfortunately the apartment was not tidy clean and was smaller than we expected. Grease and dust on the kitchen were present. The heater was not working at all. Apart from this issues we had cozy time at his place which is few minutes by foot from the Eiffel tower.

Esspecially the neighbourhood where she lives was the right thing to chose. There are nice Bistros shops and a good transport connection. The communication with her was all right. Very advisable!

3621325,294568376,2018-07-22,7070691,Terry,This was the second time we stayed in this apartment and once again it was a great experience. We were traveling with our young adult niece and the apartment layout is perfect because the kitchen and bathroom separate the bedrooms giving everyone some privacy. Although the apartment has a combination washer/dryer right across the street is a new clean laundromat which helps with longer stays. The apartment is very well located near a metro but still on a quiet side street. Isabelle is charming and she presents the right balance of availability and respecting privacy. I would absolutely recommend staying here. Merci!

19697537,214640620,2017-11-26,153138090,Dorothy,The location of the airbnb was great! It was super close to a metro station and the lines at that station easily go us to the famous tourist attractions in France. Valentin was not there when we checked in but he made sure we were able to find the key and kept good contact to make sure we were able to check in and find everything. The apartment was super clean and we were able to see part of the Eiffel Tower in the distance outside the living room window. Overall the stay was fantastic!

19845083,361711521,2018-12-24,6114839,Michele,This is a stylish typical Parisian studio with Tour Eiffel view. The apartment had all the necessary amenities and it was sparkling clean. Communication with Agathe was excellent she was super flexible with my check-in and check-out. I definitely recommend it for a couple seeking a romantic escape in Paris. Also the Wi-Fi works perfectly I was able to work remotely during my stay.

We stayed for 3 nights in her spare room and were amazed at how close it was from everything in the city. The metro was extremely convenient and due to the location Uber at night (after metro is closed) is very affordable!
Thank you so much Alice for sharing your home with us and giving us the chance to see the local way of life while being so close to all attractions.

When we come to Paris again we would love stay here!

The location in my opinion is ideal. You were close enough to walk to major Parisian neighborhoods but also got to experience the life of the locals. Eating options were great. 

We were welcomed by Ismael and were so happy to be able to meet him. We are art enthusiasts so to be able to see his work in person and meet the artist was a great experience. He is definitely one of the kindest patient people. He went over everything we needed to know and was reachable if we needed him. We were able to have a cup of tea with him and I truly felt we knew him for a long time. He waited for us to check in (we had a later flight) and helped us with our suitcases. The bed is comfortable and he supplies you with fruit jam butter everything you need to cook etc. 

I would definitely stay here again. Merci!! "

23968889,471356852,2019-06-17,242571797,Camille,Vanessa’s place was extremely nice and in a quaint traditional apartment building which made for a nice experience in Paris. She was very responsive to communication and accommodating when we needed an earlier check-in. The one point we should have been aware of is that the place is not far from the Moulin Rouge and surrounding shops and clubs but we felt safe walking through this area the whole stay even later in the evening. Many tourists and families are in the area as well and we would feel comfortable staying in the area again. Thank you again Vanessa!

Adele und Emery haben uns bei der Ankunft alles notwendige von Küche bis Waschmaschine gezeigt und ihre Telefonnummer für evtl. Fragen gegeben (was aber nicht nötig war). Sie hatten sogar eine Flasche Wein Obstsaft und Obst für uns bereitgestellt.
Die Lage ist optimal um Paris zu erkunden. Eine Beschreibung der näheren Umgebung mit guten Tipps für das Essengehen war auch sehr hilfreich.
Alles in allem waren wir 100% zufrieden."

15579358,133708183,2017-02-24,114415580,Michelle,"Simon was absolutely helpful and his place was nice and cozy. Although the space was shared with him he made me and my husband feel at home. We stayed there for one night and it was about a 8-minute walk to the Eiffel tower. He also provided us with some recommendations which worked out perfect as a one-day itinerary.  

In addition he offered us his laptop and additional assistance on booking our flight back to London. I would definitely recommend this place. It was central cosy clean and flexible when it was to check-in. "
13569879,102507364,2016-09-18,66698822,Fiona,La communication avec Clément a été très facile et son atelier au-delà de nos attentes. C'est vraiment très agréable (le lit est très confortable la décoration jolie et pratique la baignoire jacuzzi dans la salle de bains est un vrai plus après une journée de promenade ainsi que la terrasse). L'atelier est idéalement situé. On a particulièrement apprécié les restaurants et bars autour de République et du canal St Martin. On reviendra certainement et recommande vivement l'apartement de Clément!
6990720,127155165,2017-01-16,3183592,Jordan,German's apartment is lovely and well situated. There is a fantastic bakery right outside and I recommended it to anyone seeking to stay around the Bastille.

10428409,521552177,2019-09-01,232253437,Alicia,"Franck was an excellent host he gave us advice on where to eat or what to do. The check-in and check-out went perfect. At night it was a little noisy sometimes but it was ok.
All in all we had a great experience!"
14305624,181229776,2017-08-12,128785887,Gem,This is a very well appointed and well furnished apartment in the most charming neighborhood and street of Paris! We loved Patrick's place and will always want to come back to exactly this spot. All rooms are well furnished with comfortable mattresses even the couch convertible had a comfy mattress! The separate toilet room gives you the flexibility to manage a family of 5 sharing one bathroom. The bathroom kitchen and furnishings are all very clean very modern and easy to use. The water pressure in the shower exceeded expectations as did the whole apartment. Patrick thinks of every detail to make your stay comfortable right down to the marvelous espresso machine city maps and a power adapter. And Patrick is great at returning emails responding and accommodating any changes like our unexpected flight delay. And beyond the apartment the location is supreme! Montmarte is in our opinion the best neighborhood in Paris. The small winding  streets with walking access to the artist district Sacre Coure and the most picturesque storefronts and cafes are the perfect Paris holiday. A one minute walk to the nearest Metro makes touring the whole city so easy. Just outside the front door are the best bakery creperie and endless bistros/restaurants with outdoor dining. If you wanted to paint a picture of the most charming location in Paris it would be this very street.

1133596,123440032,2016-12-29,101082780,Mark,"J'ai passé un séjour très agréable chez Zazie. Elle a parfaitement organisé mon arrivée et a pris le temps pour donner toutes les explications nécessaires au déroulement du séjour. Zazie et son mari m'ont non seulement offert un accueil extrêmement chaleureux mais on aussi veillé à ce que mon passage à Paris soit le plus agréable possible par exemple en me renseignant les bonnes adresses et les lieux vraiment typiques du Paris insolite connus des seuls habitués! J'ai aussi beaucoup apprécié les petits déjeuners frais et copieux servis en toute simplicité qui étaient aussi l'occasion d'échanges sur les voyages nos passions et expériences communes. Rien à redire sur l'emplacement qui est idéal pour qui veut visiter Paris à pied ou aussi en métro (la station est au coin de la rue) tout en étant dans une rue très calme. 
Une adresse que je recommande vivement à qui aime Paris et aime aller à la rencontre de personnes pour qui l'hospitalité est un mode de vie."

13001090,167882487,2017-07-08,107977025,Brent And Belinda,This apartment is in a perfect location supermarket across the road has all you need but does create a little bit of noise in front rooms with early morning deliveries. Eiffel Tower is just down the road where you can also access the river cruise so location is perfect. Apartment is very clean and hosts are excellent in meeting you on arrival and ensuring you are set for your stay.
9338458,170688273,2017-07-16,133898486,Sanjana,Maissoun is an amazing host available all the time to answer any query. The house was very located right next to the Metro. It was fully stocked house and we had a very good experience. We will surely recommend it to everyone. We were a family of four.

1647495,68909364,2016-04-07,13602375,John,"I needed to visit Paris (from Dublin) to visit a friend in the Centre Hospitalier Sainte Anne and so wanted somewhere nearby. Of course I was influenced in my choice by comments of earlier airbnb travellers and to them: a very very big 'thank you'! Here in Catherine's was *the* best place to stay. Catherine was there to greet me on arrival she kindly offered to make me coffee/tea but I declined as I needed to see my friend. Then Catherine most generously offered to accompany me to find the hospital location of my friend (I would have had great difficulty) and I would have lost valuable time without her help. I can only speak a little French and a little Italian and Catherine was very tolerant of my modest efforts. My room was indeed a charming ""chambe simple"" very quiet (just right for a good night's sleep) very comfortable bed (so necessary for someone like me who has a bad back) and the spotless bathroom was fully stocked. A lovely breakfast was served (fresh orange juice coffee/tea croissant crusty baguette butter jams yoghurt fruit) in a truly lovely room with a view over the hospital grounds and while Catherine gave me quiet time in which to have breakfast she always chatted with me afterwards. I suppose I could write an essay about my time there but I will sum up by saying that I could not imagine a better place in Paris in which to stay. Merci beaucoup (mille grazie) Catherine."
486542,152525995,2017-05-17,6353655,Roded,"We enjoyed the appartment and the vacation very much. The appartment is exactly as in the peactures and descriptions at the website. It is in a central position at the Marais near Pompidou center.
We never met Tea but we met her colleague Yasmina which was very attentive and helpul with local information and things we needed.
We recommend this appartment.

18662438,339812269,2018-10-22,44685049,Barry John,I doubt there are but a few better located AirBnB apartments in central Paris to explore this wonderful city from. Perfect for a weekend four a family of four!
1415913,64013723,2016-02-28,59294210,Patience,Anissa was really helpful and pleasant she was a great host! it was our first time in Paris and she helped us find our way around the locations we needed to get to. She was really polite and kind to us and we felt really comfortable. The apartment was cute and cozy. 
19515575,494451643,2019-07-24,1487588,Hannah,The apartment is in an amazing location within walking distance to great restaurants and the metro. The bed was comfortable the two kids slept on the sofa bed. The balcony was a great place for coffee in the morning and cocktails in the evening. Emi was very responsive check in and out was easy. Thank you for having us!
27453711,457897676,2019-05-25,21556576,Graham,On the plus side this apartment is in a lovely area which is in a quiet neigbourhood with lovely bars cafes and restaurants. I think it would be ideal for a couple and 2 children but not for 4 adults. The loft is difficult to get up to (for an adult); you need to crouch down into a three foot entrance. Once up there there is no storage for clothes or space to hang stuff and no privacy. Also the shower doesn't cope with 4 people having a shower. Our real gripe though was that Marie was conspicuous by her absence. When we arrived at 4pm the concierge was not expecting us and the room was not ready - she had not been informed of our arrival. She was very helpful and agreed to prepare the room for us and we disappeared for a couple of hours while she did that. However no communication from Marie at all no apology no explanation. The room was then prepared for 2 people as my nephew and his girlfriend had not arrived yet and we had to contact the concierge again to make up the room / lay sheets for them. We then had to hunt around for more towels as we had only been given for two. Marie had clearly not communicated to the concierge that there were 4 guests. The shower did not work properly as the regulator to add cold water seemed not to be working. Thus the shower was so hot you couldn't stand underneath it. I contacted Marie about this - no response. No response on leaving no recommendations on restaurants etc. We did have a fun time in Paris in the end and were very grateful to the concierge. But Marie was perhaps the most absent host we have ever experienced on AirBNB and I sincerely hope she repairs the shower before the next guests arrive because it is dangerous. Mistakes happen we accept that but the way you deal with them is important. Marie's method seemed to be to just maintain complete radio silence.
23729975,284834560,2018-07-02,88397770,Emily,We had a great stay! The location is fantastic and the three of us had plenty of space in Jk's apartment. Just what we needed :)

4285903,255086305,2018-04-19,163038844,Harriet,The room was lovely as was the whole property however the real perk of staying here for us was the location. Only a 20 min metro journey from all the main sites and close to the airport it was great. Additionally the immediate area was safe buzzing and beautiful. A great place to stay.

Wir können einen Aufenthalt bei ihr sehr empfehlen und kommen gerne wieder.

Il répondait très vite à nos questions avant notre arrivée et pendant notre séjour également ! Tout était vraiment parfait ! Léo a fait en sorte que notre séjour se déroule merveilleusement bien ! L'appartement est neuf et très bien entretenu ! On a adoré la mezzanine et la décoration ! Et la salle de bain est très belle ! Parfait pour une petite famille de 6 personnes ! L'appartement est situé à 1 min à pied des Champs-Elysées et l'immeuble est pourtant très paisible ! A côté nous avions l'un des meilleurs boulangers de Paris l'un des meilleurs bouchers et de nombreux bars / restaurants ! J'espère pouvoir y faire un nouveau séjour :) Héloïse

17399100,146020586,2017-04-21,17384128,Antonina,The place reeked of cigarette smoke. We couldn't stay here and left immediately and had to find last minute accommodations. My mother had a reaction to the smell and could not enter the apartment. The host did not want to refund the cost so we paid for one night here and one night at a hotel. Bad experience. 
1190478,144980024,2017-04-17,26739473,Roberta,Appartamento di charme in un quartiere tranquillo vicino a negozi e ristoranti.
3922345,20518524,2014-09-30,1760713,Sara,Jean-Philippe was the most helpful friendly and kind host we could've ever imagined! He speaks English flawlessly (used to live in LA) and was in constant contact with us on our day of arrival to help us find the place. He even carried my luggage up the stairs for me! He is extremely organized and has a binder full of information for his guests including restaurant recommendations. His apartment is very nice and was immaculately clean and the view of the Sacré-Coeur was breathtaking. I can't say enough good things about him and his apartment other than I wished we had stayed longer! 
6803143,229380336,2018-01-23,99262396,Ronald,Great terrace rooftop view. Recommend to enjoy the terrace balcony with Parisian pastry and coffee. Room was small so not suitable for huge luggage but otherwise clean with warm shower facility.

429331,2429106,2012-09-27,3393866,Laura,We had a pleasant stay at Pierrette´s place. The apartment is very comfortable warm spacious and full of fantastic books. We felt almost at home. The rooms are quite large and bright and the location is great. The neighborhood is not very touristic but close to the greatest districts of Paris as Le Marais.  Pierrette is a great host. She was very helpful. I strongly recommend the place.
31495283,423755071,2019-03-15,9399153,Mike,"Camille’s apartment is a gem in between the 6th and 7th districts arguably the best location to stay when you are in Paris. I was a solo traveller but the place can easily fit 2-3 people with a double sofa bed. 

The apartment is cosy and has all the amenities you would need and Camille is responsive via text. 

It is near several metro stops all along different metro lines and you can find bars cafes and bakeries on the street itself as well as shopping food souvenirs and a grocery within 2 minutes walking distance. The Musee D’Orsay less than 10 minutes by foot and the Louvre is 15mins. 

Highly recommend this place"

Could split hairs on a few small things (didn't realize the check in process involved a 3rd location) but overall it was a great experience and I would recommend 
4724941,298426793,2018-07-29,104678262,Rafaela,Super acessível nas respostas. Casa muito bem posicionada com metro a 50m. Último andar num prédio de 6 sem elevador. Casa super acolhedora

There was tea coffee and sweets if we desired. Once inside the building it was very quiet. The WIFI was fast. The furnishings were gorgeous; I was inspired to open the window and play Edith Piaf!

It is a very convenient location and very secure environment.  Unfortunately during our stay there was a construction going on the street which was extremely noisy.  And there was a party at night on the street that went on till 2am.  
976953,411018330,2019-02-11,28271921,Parisa,We had a great couple of days at Anthony’s apartment. The location is great; really convenient with lots of nice bars on rue Ramey and the Rochechouart. Anthony was very communicative and responded very quickly to messages. Check-in was a breeze thanks to his clear instructions. The apartment is typically Parisian and actually looks much better than the photos suggest! All in all a great stay so thanks Anthony! :)

The flat in a cute neighborhood with several great cafes and restaurants within walking distance from the metro. I would highly recommend the Argentinian restaurant across the street. The flat is small and the bathroom in particular is very small but it is the perfect size for two people. Overall my husband and I had a great time and would stay there again.

5183724,249611480,2018-04-02,4024478,Jennifer,Such a cute place and in a great location. We loved it. The beds were super comfortable. If you are OCD and need it sparkling clean this is not the place for you! It feels like staying at a really lovely friend’s house as she and her family live there when guests are not staying.
15388631,258573282,2018-04-29,21456572,Jing,An artistic place in central Paris. Easy to go to most of the landmarks and CDG by subway. It’s a great place to stay if you like to experience the authentic Parisian life
34608803,535767209,2019-09-25,6427478,Carlos Javier,Muy recomendable.
17648726,195361072,2017-09-19,38927180,Shilpa,Would highly recommend this cozy apartment in 16th arrondissement. The location is fantastic. Very close to Jasmin metro line 9. Couple of supermarkets in the vicinity that is convenient for your daily needs. Also i really appreciated Xaviers advice of taking a chauffeured car rather than a metro from CDG. Worked out really well. Ryan checked us in and he was so warm and friendly. Gave us some really useful tips. Anwar our driver was really helpful with our bags and we can't thank him enough. Xavier was very responsive...responded immediately to all my messages. I really hope to come back again with my family...

13387921,538808952,2019-09-30,275006355,Danye,"This is a very lovely apartment. Washroom kitchen bedroom microwave refrigerator washing machine heater wardrobe cupboard and more. You can live here very comfortably.
The traffic is very convenient it is super close to the subway line 2 and the line 3 is not far. Near the apartment you can find Carrefour Francrix and a variety of restaurants. You can also walk to the Chinese restaurants Chinese supermarkets McDonald's KFC Sephora near the apartment and buy the daily necessities you need.
The landlord is also very nice and kind answer my questions quickly and tell me where I can buy what I need. The neighbors are also very helpful. On the day I arrived one of my neighbors helped me move my heavy luggage to the apartment.
If you want to feel the real Paris this is the perfect place!"
27011599,328101236,2018-09-25,2800227,Linda,Wonderful location (5 mins walking from Notre Dame) nicely decorated apt with a convenience store downstairs. This seemed like someone's home so there were a lot of personal belongings in the apartment and bedrooms (locked closets baby crib baby car sear books etc.). It felt a tad expensive but it is Paris after all. Have to coordinate with a travel company called Welkeys that hires representatives to hand out/ collect keys during check in and check out.

21183788,469293225,2019-06-14,2279640,Eric,The issue of broken elevator was not resolved for a few days and we had to inquire several times. You're up five flights so if you've got luggage it's hard and every time you go out. Also I don't think the owner Franck ever actually even texts or is involved with the guests. It's all a service and it does feel quite cold and like you're on your own there. The shower is old and is yellowed and there is mold. The master bed is great and the sheets are clean and good quality. The other small bedroom is not very inviting and the windows do not open so it is stuffy. I also recommend just having some salt and pepper in the kitchen. Would really make a big difference because it's not something you want to go buy during a 5 day stay. Otherwise I want to say the space is nice and the location is amazing. We had a good overall experience.
6385761,269969726,2018-05-28,26492792,Stephen,Emeric's place is very clean charming and wonderfully located for those using the metro.  We stayed over a week and it was a great home base for visiting Paris. Emeric is super hospitable and organized.  The photos on the AirBnb site give an accurate perspective of the apartment.  There is convenient shopping and two street markets close by.  
13044049,79797414,2016-06-14,66283985,Corbin,I had a great stay at Mooz's place. The apartment was clean and centrally located. It is a shared space but I had plenty of privacy. Overall great experience!

NAthalie was extremely helpful and flexible with check in time. She responded quickly to EVERYTHING- even a light bulb blew out when I arrive and she had it fixed immediately! I will be going back for a longer stay of 5 nights. I highly recommend this beautiful place! Merci Nathalie!"

1080284,33051059,2015-05-24,17578,Chris,Paul and Ani are just the sweetest people. They genuinely enjoy chatting with you and making you feel at home. They both personally welcomed me even though my arrival was at night on a work night (for them). Breakfast goodies were set out for me each morning--what a pleasant surprise! I sat on the balcony each morning and took in the Tour Eiffel lights each night; the neighborhood is very peaceful and friendly with lots of different ethnic foods. Paul is extremely responsive by text and helped me in person too with random questions such as where to find a candy shop. the home is very accessible to many neighborhoods. I had a lovely stay with Paul and Ani!
5332708,326432413,2018-09-22,1680689,Genevieve,J'ai passé un très bon séjour chez Clara. L'appartement est aménagé avec goût et tout est prévu pour se sentir bien. J'ai rencontré des difficultés avec la connexion Internet et Clara fut réactive pour essayer de résoudre le problème. Je recommande !

15966114,352493869,2018-11-25,93819098,Maxime,Court séjour dans le logement de Sebastien l'appartement est idéalement situé et pratique. Typique parisien je recommande ce logement qui a un bon rapport qualité-prix. Seul bémol la finesse des cloisons entraine quelques nuisances sonores lorsque les autres personnes se déplacent dans les parties communes de l'immeuble.
1474850,11551105,2014-04-07,10010300,Alice,"Thank you for a great stay Alex! Comfortable stay in a great location and the bottle of wine is a lovely touch!
"
10480504,236391785,2018-02-19,113548234,Anina,"The apartments worked well for our group of 10 adults. The host was communicative and professional and the space was as described well appointed and comfortable. I would highly recommend for a group although the smallest bedroom was tight for two adults (better for one adult or one or two children). Additionally one bedroom was up a narrow spiral staircase and the nearest toilet was back down the staircase which might not be convenient for all guests. The apartments are up several flights of stairs and the building does not have an elevator.
The location is fabulous and living and dining spaces comfortable and well decorated. A wonderful way to experience Paris with a group."
15097414,473137709,2019-06-21,69615322,Diane,Beautiful apartment with a great view!  Near a trendy neighborhood with lots of shops bars and restaurants...steps away from the metro.
1133596,457498647,2019-05-24,255783349,Kyra Jacqueline,Zazie's airbnb was perfect! It is surrounded by cute restaurants and cafes and very close to the metro. We were able to get to all the popular sites easily with public transportation :). The room itself was very clean and bright. The ceiling and windows are very high which made the room feel extra spacious. You also have your own shower and bathroom. Zazie was really sweet and helpful and we really loved the breakfast ^^. I highly recommend staying here ♡.
4568802,233392703,2018-02-09,41890615,Laure,Louise a été réactive et a toujours répondu au téléphone lorsque nous avons eu un problème de clés ! Merci pour le séjour l'appartement est agréable !
882192,329171495,2018-09-28,105969057,Deborah,In an excellent spot near the Pigalle metro with view of Eiffel Tower. There is a lift and all the amenities you need. The outlook gives a feeling of space
2195317,186082606,2017-08-23,108408738,Flavius,"Overall this is an ok place but not really a fantastic apartment as the pictures may lead you to believe. At first we were very underwhelmed when first seeing the apartment and comparing with the impression we had from the pictures.

It's more of a nitpicky thing but for the price we expected the place to be maintained a bit better. For example there are screw holes in the wall various stains broken towel rack broken towel hooks on the door. The pictures are certainly a bit miss-leading.

Pros:
Ground floor easy to find safe neighborhood very close to the metro very close stores and restaurants.

Cons:
*You have almost no space to dry clothes if you wash them. (There is a laundry just down the street but they were closed while we were there).
*You can hear almost all the noises from the neighbors in the apartment. If you are a light sleeper the neighbors walking down the stairs or doing laundry will wake you up. 
*If you are a big guy like me the shower is a bit small and challenging.
*The photos are a bit miss-leading and the value isn't really here. The place isn't as nice as it appears to be in the pictures.
*Yas is a good host however it always takes her hours to reply to messages.

Tips:
*There are shutters on the windows and you can actually close them. 
*Buy the pack of metro tickets because you will be using them every time you leave the apartment to get into downtown."

240938,22726293,2014-11-12,23508172,Chelsea Jeongin,Valérie has been a great host. She's been kind and understanding throughout my stay at her place. The best thing was the flexible check-in and check-out time. Also she responded my emails very quickly. I'll be definitely recommending her place to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Paris. Thank you Valérie! :)
1156037,143538154,2017-04-12,103868263,Erik Alexander,"Es un buen lugar con una buena ubicación a unos pasos de la estación de metro Saint Marcel seguro se puede caminar por los alrededores cerca de supermercado lugares para comprar comida y cafeterias Samira estará al pendiente de tí por si requieres ayuda! Definitivamente facilitó mi estancia en París! A unos minutos en metro de Notre Dame Museo del Louvre Torre Eifel Arco del Triunfo Campos Eliseos Jardines de Luxemburgo Trocadero Rio Sena y demas atractivos turisticos. Lo recomiendo es un espacio ideal para dos personas pero si lo que que buscas es un espacio para descanzar por las noches y poder recorrer las calles parisinas por el día pueden acomodarse cuatro personas! Agua caliente todo el tiempo lugar tranquilo y sin ruido wifi a la perfección que te permite programar tus recorridos una noche antes fue una bonita experiencia pude conocer París aunque días son los que hicieron falta! Regresaría sin duda alguna! 

Muchas Gracias Samira por compartir tu espacio! Saludos y bendiciones!

534650,430921693,2019-03-31,7723895,Sarah,"Gillian was really accommodating and let us leave our bags in the apartment as our flights were early morning. She was also very quick to respond when I emailed a query while we were there. The area is fantastic!! Straight walk down to the Right Bank Centre Pompidou Louvre and Notre Dame - plus great vintage shops along the way. 

Lots of bars and restaurants around the apartment especially on Rue St-Denis. Great bakeries nearby too!

Apartment is small but we fit very comfortably with 5 - two on the couch beds one on the day bed and two in the double up in the mezzanine. 
You would definitely need to be comfortable together though as you're sleeping very close.  Enough room to eat breakfast at the table together straight from the bakery every morning! That's all we needed. 

Easy check-in and great area. Would really recommend this apartment."
11203901,144262855,2017-04-15,12725048,Mette,Sara was very friendly and she was there to greet us and explain everything. The apartment is as described wonderful bright and spacious and in a very pleasant and calm area with great places where to eat and drink coffee the and wine. The kitchen is tiny a few things not thoroughly clean but there is all you need and the overall impression is superbe. So we were very happy and we can highly recommend a stay here. 
10351331,75706651,2016-05-22,21651513,Laurie,The apartment was as advertised - it was in a fantastic location the apartment itself was quiet clean and pleasant everything functioned well and Sid's sister met us as planned with the key.  The common areas of the building are not in good shape with some large holes in the walls but this was in no way a problem within the apartment.  I recommend the apartment for one or two people.

13165246,257426679,2018-04-26,91142196,Наталья,Correcte mais il y a plusieurs bémols: l’odeur du tabac tenace l’acoustique assez forte les draps sont très usés. L’appartement convient à 1-2 personnes maximum à trois vous seriez déjà trop à étroit. L’emplacement  et l’accessibilité sont irréprochables ainsi que la communication avec l’hôte.

Had a small issue at the start but she was quick to respond and fix it right away. The unit is close to the canal and great to rent scooters to explore the area. Would stay again!
10614603,98152673,2016-08-29,75842204,Barbara,"Vladimir's place was the ideal base for our short holiday in Paris. It is small as described in the listing but has everything you need for a few days and the view from the balconies is definitely a huge plus and a well-earned reward for having climbed 6 flights of stairs (which is not actually as bad as it may sound).
We stayed there during a bit of a heatwave and as you would expect a studio flat under a tin roof won't be the coolest place to be but the two fans that Vladimir provided helped with that. 

The location is also excellent close to public transport that can get you to all the major sights and within walking distance of Sacré Cœur. There is a nice bakery just 3 doors down the street as well as other shops and nice restaurants in the vicinity.

Vladimir was not there to meet us but he explained everything in great detail beforehand and he was always reachable. He also left a bottle of wine for us which was nice touch.

All in all a great experience!"
24425449,454442203,2019-05-18,1514548,Andrea,Clean well appointed private yard so quiet in great neighbourhood with many new restaurants and bakeries close to several Metros and buses.

23417235,455752978,2019-05-20,14554407,Sandra,We absolutely loved Michael's flat and hope to return soon. We loved it so much that when we make plans we're going to probably try to make it around the availability of his flat. The pictures do not do the space justice.  It is more spacious than the pictures suggest.  It has everything you could possibly need. His design style is fabulous and like something you would see in a magazine.  This was our first time in Paris and we were not sure about which arrondissement to select. We are so happy we selected based on his description. We were in the heart of the beautiful Montorguiel neighborhood. We stepped out the door and to the left there was a michelin-rated restaurant and you go a little further and there was Rue Montorguiel a walking street full of cafes patisseries produce shops flower stores and so much more. Walk a little further and you have easy access to the metro which was super easy to navigate.  It was all amazing! Beautiful flat + ideal location = ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

20199376,295283495,2018-07-23,71739984,Vincent,I enjoyed staying in this Parisian studio with my two 10 year old daughters. As a studio there isn't much space but it was to be expected and it has everything we could need plus it is very clean and tidy. The neighborhood is lively and safe yet the immediate neighborhood is quiet which is fantastic. Only drawback for us as we stayed while it was very hot is that when you open the windows everyone in the streets or the skatepark across the street can see everything in the studio. Other than that it was very comfortable.
14244978,439631056,2019-04-19,47152750,Rowena,"Thierry’s place was a great little haven to come home to at the end of each day. It was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed.

Located just minutes walk to the metro and Luxembourg gardens and easy access to restaurants and a supermarket. Adequate cooking equipment supplied for simple cooking.

Thierry welcomed us on our arrival and let us in to drop our bags and show us around even before the flat was ready. We were also able to leave our bags safely for the day when we were leaving late in the day.

Thank you Thierry for your hospitality. We hope to return another time."
18146763,283556849,2018-06-30,41319755,Janet,The flat is close to everything especially the Metro (Les Halles Chatalet). Very efficient use of space with two double beds and one single bed loft plus the couch. We were 4 adults and one child and we had plenty of space. There is a bakery literally across the street from the flat and a little market so very convenient for buying breakfast food and/or lunch & dinner items.  Michael was an amazing host and responded right away when we had questions. He also arranged for a taxi to pick us up at the airport on the first day and allowed us to check in early and drop off our bags which was super helpful. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you!

Previo a nuestra llegada la comunicación fue muy buena y fluida pero el día de nuestro arribo nadie nos estaba esperando en el departamento y fue muy frustrante. La respuesta a algunos pedidos no fue inmediata tampoco. Sin embargo al final el chico fue muy amable en pedirnos un taxi para el aeropuerto y siempre se comunico con nosotros vía (Hidden by Airbnb) .
El barrio es muy cómodo para transportarse aunque no era el barrio que esperábamos la zona de la Ópera.

19376460,296133448,2018-07-25,68928017,Marcela,"El departamento de Geneviève Et Xavier es exactamente como lo publican en la página.
La entrada del edificio de a un jardín muy agradable y en un lateral se encuentra el departamento. 
La ubicación es excelente en un barrio encantador  el subte  y también  algún supermercado están a pocas cuadras.
Nosotros fuimos en pleno verano y nos resultó un poco caluroso el departamento a pesar de contar con un ventilador en cada cuarto.
 Éramos cinco personas y estábamos muy justos con el espacio. Creo que para cuatro personas es ideal.
Las instalaciones son modernas y estaba limpio contaba con lavaysecarropa y lavavajillas además de heladera y microondas. La ducha es muy buena.
Contaba con café té azúcar y otras cosas para desayunar también contaba con productos de limpieza y para la higiene personal.
En definitiva es un lugar muy recomendable en una hermosa cuidad.

Margaux was also a very helpful and communicative host ready with very helpful tips and the necessary information about the neighborhood and Paris itself. The apartment is located on the 2nd floor from ground level in a lively busy vibrant street and is also located next to the Metro - which is excellent! Definitely recommended.

4973468,68950818,2016-04-08,51798475,Ben,Franck is a great host. He was very helpful throughout our stay - always proposing the best places in Paris to eat at visit. His hospitality was amazing and definitely matched  by his beautiful apartment in a great location! Would highly recommend. Thanks Franck!
27675373,342756115,2018-10-29,199073399,Kalina,"The room was exactly as pictured and spacious enough for a one night stay. The bed was comfortable the  bedroom bathroom and toilet were clean. The location is great - the address is within easy reach to a metro station and within walking distance to the flixbus station. The host made sure to respond to my messages as fast as possible and was quite welcoming. I loved the cat!
My only remark would be that it was very cold during the night."
37855184,546959508,2019-10-14,291499285,Jéssica,Good Place and good location! It’s really near by good restaurants and tourist places! The house is very comfortable for two person but miss paper toilet and napkins! But in the end everything was perfect
10423725,433319947,2019-04-06,29657073,Luis,"Simply perfect.
Jehanne’s house is located 30 mins away (by walk) from the river museums and Notre Dame.

Also she’s an amazing host answers really fast to any doubt and the house is super clean and beautiful."
1350350,225638287,2018-01-07,29164274,Arnaud,"Si vous recherchez  quelque chose d’atypique à Paris ce loft est fait pour vous. Il est confortable pratique idéalement situé près du Métro (2 5 7). L’hébergement est très confortable et les espaces de vie sont grands voire immense si l’on se rappelle que l’on est au cœur du 10è arrondissement. 
On trouve les commerces nécessaire à proximité immédiate et l’appartement est doté de tout ce qu’il faut. 
Nous étions 5 et avons utilisé 4 chambres ravis que celle du bas dispose de sa propre salle de bains. Les lits sont bons il y a 3 grands lits. 
Honnêtement il n’y a rien à redire. Si ce coin de Paris est proche de vos attractions : allez-y ! 
Nous y retournerons avec très grand plaisir. Merci pour l’accueil et la flexibilité !"
615069,10151004,2014-02-03,10959967,Clive,Really nice apartment in the centre of Paris with great transport links. We were a group of 6 staying for a weekend and couldn't find fault with the place. Great communication from Eloise too.
29877253,356810931,2018-12-09,39593546,Benoit,Très jolie petit appartement sous les toits et très très bien placé. Accueil très sympathique de la part de Julien. Je recommande !
22716780,237495246,2018-02-23,4067944,Jean,Très joli studio très propre et très bien décoré. Violaine a été très arrangeante pour notre heure d'arrivée. Le seul petit bémol est plutôt lié à la météo puisqu'il a fait très froid à Paris et le petit radiateur du studio n'a permis de garder une température suffisante. À conseiller sans retenue à part ça.
34275897,456316995,2019-05-21,258959812,Victor,Gary and his team are very friendly and good hosts. i recommend them for your next trip to Paris!
33315834,501955242,2019-08-04,28288908,Sarah,Justine’s place was so perfect for a weekend visit to Paris with my mother and sister. We loved the style of the apartment and it was in a really convenient location. Lots of great local food places and close to the Metro. Would recommend!
9559950,94024310,2016-08-14,17095159,Terry,la descripción del anuncio se ajustaba a la realidad. el apartamento está situado en una zona tranquila del centro de París con zonas muy interesantes a su alrededor. Didier fue agradable y solícito en todo momento y aunque no llegué a conocerle estuvo pendiente en todo momento. el apartamento es pequeño en la línea de lo que es París suficiente para un persona y para una semana. 
11439005,539866070,2019-10-02,145688528,Si-Lam,The apartment especially the bedroom was quiet. Bedroom and living room windows face an inner courtyard with steel curtains that will block out all light. A suggestion would be to add another light in the bedroom because it's easy to make the room very dark at night. Kitchen was great; we even made a few meals. Induction stove-top. Bathroom was nice as well. Location is fantastic: very close to 2 different metro lines and fairly close to a third so they save quite a bit of travel time to most parts of Paris. Very close to an outdoor market. Spacious elevator right to the apartment door. Felt very safe. Would definitely stay again.
285786,8348317,2013-10-27,8736340,Victor,Dominique and Catherine are fantastic hosts. They respond almost immediately to emails and the check-in was very easy.  The apartment itself is spacious comfortable bright and very close to everything. We walked to the Louvre Notre Dame Saint-Germain Hotel de Ville Pompidou etc and the metro at Les Halles with many lines was less than 5 minutes away.  I would recommend the hosts and the apartment to anyone planning to enjoy their stay in Paris.
27919298,407852114,2019-02-03,113087133,Marie,Parfait rien a dire je recommande
16047627,122398374,2016-12-23,21272276,Hannah,Gilles was an amazing and thoughtful host and his place is beautiful! The location was fantastic both in terms of setting and proximity to the metro. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
5860876,63194383,2016-02-21,41465457,Ella,Large spacious room and clean apartment good for people going on a short cheap break. Host spoke good English and left info in the room about the area. We were unable to use the bathroom a few mornings due to the host needing it which was slightly inconvenient and we also didn't feel comfortable using the living room or kitchen even though we had access to it. We both felt we were Invading the hosts home so would be best for people who are planning on spending a lot of time exploring Paris/eating out or just need a place to crash. 
30897001,544398663,2019-10-10,145993202,Kendra,Xenia’s place was an amazing accommodation and the location was perfect for all of the major sights. Would recommend and stay here again.
10713121,254615535,2018-04-17,14769702,Allan,"We loved this location. So close to Gard de L’est and easy to get around.
Fell in love with Rue Fauborg St Denis - a real Paris street zero tourists apart from us and every food store/restaurant/cafe you need - less cool than say La Marais but more authentic for it and pumping after 5.
The flat was big enough for five of us but not huge. A bit dusty throughout but generally clean the kitchen is pokey but all perfectly serviceable. Plumbing as with most European flats it seems struggles sometimes with volume! Bloody old world plumbing!
My wife felt the beds were too hard and had trouble sleeping but no problem for me. My daughter loved the comfy couch. The flat is on the second floor above an internal courtyard so no street noise apart from some cleaning plates from a bistro below.
Ismael was really responsive when we had to get in to flat."

3800644,80028027,2016-06-15,5651985,Mark,"What a great experience with Delphine's flat in Paris. I have used  AirBnB in Paris several times and her flat was great. Nice location near Beaumarchais with access to many cultural sites restaurants local cafes and markets. I always cook when staying afar and the kitchen was well equipped. 

Delphine was simply great in her communications and hostess responsibilities. She met me even though my flight was two hours late arriving plus she was absolutely attentive to my needs for the flat.

I had a couple of issues that were resolved quickly when I requested help.

I highly recommend this flat and of course the hostess. I will use one of Delphine's places again:-)
"
34885134,520265116,2019-08-30,22554462,Amy,"Book with Véronique and you will not be disappointed! 

Her apartment is very close to a main station and two good metros so you can very easily get into central Paris but also to CDG airport Versailles and Disney Land. 

Vèronique kindly met us at the main station which is less than 5 mins walk from the apartment. 

There are a great selection of shops on the doorstep and a very good bar directly opposite the apartment. We would buy fresh bread cheese fruit and meats each night and eat with the balcony doors open enjoying the surroundings. 

Véronique is very welcoming and the extra little touches she leaves make her the perfect host. The apartment is sparkling clean the decor is very stylish and we felt so very at home. She gave excellent travel advice and made sure everything was ok before leaving us to our trip.

Our next Paris trip will 100% be at Véronique’s place as she more than exceeded our expectations."

3509041,23092250,2014-11-23,5079926,Matt,Nathalie and her apartment were great. It's in a great location - walking distance to many sites and easy access to metro and the city bikes. The apartment was cute and very clean - the croissants and fresh flowers were a nice touch as well. To top it all off Nathalie was an exceptional host. She was very communicative provided some great recommendations was very hospitable. I'd highly recommend her apartment.
539800,352990126,2018-11-26,134962794,Josh,We just had an amazing stay at Nina's place. The apartment is in a perfect location with great shops restaurants bakeries etc just steps away. It is small but very cute and perfect for a family of 5 as each child got their own bedroom. Nina was a fantastic host  and helped us arrange a taxi for our departure. It is a little noisy as it is in the heart of the Marias but that is city living! Thanks Nina.

1900636,255067360,2018-04-19,51400584,Bran,The house is perfect on the ground floor which means you don’t need to take your luggage to go stairs. There is supermarket bakery(the deserts is soooo delicious) and some shops just nearby the house. Also the transportation is just few minutes walk from the place. Highly recommended and will go back again if have chance to visit Paris.

4225678,185363475,2017-08-21,32981173,Aman,The place is convenient for a couple or family as you will find a supermarket across the road and a convenient store downstairs. It has a small lift but a reliable one. Gare Du Nord is just three minutes walk. Quirky decor but you love it if you love life. Recommended for its cleanliness and having most things you need if you cook.

Thank you Michael!"
2667375,12141196,2014-04-23,13538111,David,Spacious and well-designed apartment in an AMAZING location. Great restaurants all around and right in the right spot in Paris. Very kind and courteous hosts.
9248720,161461754,2017-06-18,99527904,Emilie,I chose this apartment based on ratings and reviews. The room was impressively small. We were able to cook small meals. Karolina and her family were extremely flexible and helpful. We accidentally lost the key. We were given a spare and we gladly paid to replace the one we lost. Unfortunately none of those reviews talk about how incredibly hot Paris is in the summer. We had to rearrange the room just to open the window and even the the room was an oven! It didn't matter much during the day because we were out sight seeing. But at night we were sweating something terrible!  
15540665,443479451,2019-04-26,221645039,Tom,This place gives you the ultimate Parisian experience. The metro is right at your doorstep and you get a spacious apartment that is not too far outside central Paris. However keep in mind that the host lives in this apartment so every room is quite full with their things including the bedroom you stay in.
16241207,344227454,2018-11-03,127451447,Alisha,We enjoyed our time at Jeanne's flat in Paris. Jeanne was prompt in her replies and very friendly!

3513206,41627677,2015-08-08,33201688,Charlotte,"The communication with Sandro and Lina before we got to Paris was great. They sent us all of the information we needed and directions on how to get from the airport to their place.  Sandro and Lina them selves were not in Paris when we got there but they had arranged with a friend to come and meet us. Sha also had contacted me on mail before our arrival. 

The apartment was like the pictures. Perfectly located by the Pompidou center and with a walking distance to almost every sight worth seeing. There were fresh towels and bed sheets to put on. The kitchen had all we needed and we could get the food we wanted for breakfast from a shop right nearby. Great falafel place in the street and a nice bakery straight across the road. Quiet neighbourhood. Only thing bad was that cigarette smoke came in the windows when the neighbours smoked. 

All in all a great place to stay while in Paris!

Thank you so much!"

Trotz großer Hitze war es in der Wohnung angenehm und gut auszuhalten. Die Wohnung liegt nah an Metro-Station und Bushaltestellen vor der Haustür sind Bäcker Lebensmittelläden und Supermärkte. Restaurants Bistros und Cafés sind ebenso reichlich vorhanden. Um die Ecke ist ein nettes Viertel mit vielen Bars und Nachtleben mit Live-Musik. Caroline hat eine kleine Mappe mit Infos und Ausgeh-Tipps in der Wohnung hinterlegt sie hat mir bei der Ankunft persönlich die Schlüssel übergeben und das Wichtigste gezeigt das Auschecken war unproblematisch. Ich habe mich in der Wohnung sofort wohlgefühlt gut geschlafen und werde bei einem nächsten Paris-Trip gerne wiederkommen.

3600767,152133378,2017-05-15,117837592,Sara,"This apartment is the perfect place to stay! There's a metro right outside the door and the location is very close to so many sites. It's within walking distance to The Louvre Notre Dame touleries Concord Bastille the Opera House market patisserie brasserie and more. I loved that we enter into an exterior courtyard before entering into the apartment building. It helped keep things quiet while still being central to so many things. The apartment was clean and well equipped with adapters and blow dryers. There was plenty of space for the 8 adults that stayed. I was worried the round king bed would be uncomfortable and small (my husband is 6'4""... he fit just fine but he bends his knees to sleep. His legs would hang off if they were straight). We were exhausted every night so my opinion of what's comfortable may be a little skewed. We all slept really well though. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone!! You won't be disappointed."

2031777,130768887,2017-02-08,92865947,Jiwoo,"Evening elo. At first I should say sorry to you that I couldn't give you the five stars. Let me explain this situation.
I know you did try to make us more comfortable. early-check in and late-check out & additional towers improve that surely. But the thing was in your attitude as an airbnb host. First you seemed like ignoring guest's sincerity. One guest before us put a message card with a small cookie for you on the table when we arrived in bnb. But you didn't even touch that till we leave that house(3 nights and 4 days)... It dissapointed us a lot. Because it made us felt that we're not in the ""airbnb"" but literally in a hostel which is run only by ""business"" mind.
Just saying your friend didn't wash his dishes directly after using. For the last you sent me a mail to get five stars. You said that please grade five stars if we liked it otherwise just send you a message what should be improved while still grading five stars for your business. It was kind of non-sense to me. I reserved this bnb because of the five stars actually. Now I fully understand why you get that high grading.. And I don't wanna all other people are cheated by this grading system. Sorry for saying this anyway. Hope your business be better and better than now.

2411919,68986297,2016-04-08,1915510,Lauren,"Carolyn's apartment was very cute and ideally located on a small quaint street with a bevy of nice boutiques and restaurants.  Unfortunately there was construction on that street while we were there so we woke to the sound of jackhammering every morning at 7:45am.  But the biggest downside was the fact the downstairs toilet and the upstairs shower (basically in ""the bedroom"") shared the same piping.  So when the toilet was flushed downstairs the shower upstairs smelled like raw sewage for a good 20 minutes.  We had to run the water to try to get rid of the smell.  If that was fixed it would be a charming place.  "
24639350,480245204,2019-07-02,258546306,Mylene,Better than I expected.  It has all the necessary amenities accessible to train restaurants and shops.  Easy check in and check out.  It was quiet at night.  Stayed here with 2 kids and 3 adults and we were comfortable. Highly recommend this place.

787962,134431963,2017-02-27,117183771,Cierra,I would absolutely recommend this spot. Very cute acletic little loft - the location is slightly far away from the big tourist attractions but taking the metro quickly fixes that. Alex was warm and welcoming and offered great recommendations for anything we had in mind if you're there on a Sunday ask him about brunch !

1118764,125174643,2017-01-04,3955374,Trisanto Henki Wira Saputra,"Jerome's place is nice. Even though the room size is small and makes us difficult to move since we have 2 large luggages but it was fine. 

The bed is comfy and the bathroom is clean too. Jerome provides self-service breakfast like bread or croissant which is nice and also tea and coffee that we can make by ourselves from the coffee machine. 

As for the location is easy to access. It is walking distance to the train station Paris Nord/Gare du Nord. So for those who will continue journey to other places via Paris Nord Jerome's place is a good choice.

3454732,461162828,2019-05-31,165056331,Scott,Beautiful studio apartment in the heart of Paris. It’s an absolutely unbeatable location and my boyfriend and I easily walked to the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower many times. Very nice kitchen and bathroom and the waterfall shower was perfect. The owner was very accessible and helpful throughout the trip. Due to the size of the apartment this property is probably best for single travelers or couples. Overall the best experience I’ve ever had with Airbnb.
12240436,190371439,2017-09-04,130421720,Christine,Elsa's place was wonderful very quiet at night despite being in a very lively part of Paris super comfortable and absolutely spotless. Elsa took the time to meet with me and tell me about good places to walk around her neighborhood and was very friendly and responsive (despite my having multiple email issues). I had an amazing stay and would love to return soon! Thank you so much Elsa!

4911410,115351161,2016-11-23,47010732,Beth,"Fantastic location and wonderful apartment! My sister brother and I each had a queen bed and to find that in a hotel for a comparable price is impossible. The bathroom WAS tiny but completely usable and had everything we needed. Patricia's communication was BEYOND EXCELLENT! She touched base before during and after our trip and when the toilet had an issue during our stay she had it fixed for us the exact same day. I cannot WAIT to stay ""with her"" again in the future.
Location was fantastic. Just a 2-3 minute walk to Grands Blvd metro with parking and bus stops also nearby. A hop-on-hop-off bus stop was also about a 5-8 minute walk away. Plenty of restaurants bakeries grocery stores nearby and was in a very safe area. 
This was our first air bnb experience and we couldn't have asked for more. :-)"

8180309,209871720,2017-11-06,47042927,Gilberth & Oscar,Cobran 3€ por cada equipaje dejado en la oficina. Al llegar al piso nos pareció q el baño estaba algo sucio. Para ducharse un problema climatizar el agua. La cortina del baño se puede caer. Fuimos 5 personas y se puede estar fácilmente 5 ó 6. El Barrio es un poco feo. Pero es la zona. Para estar unos días está bien

13390968,209816929,2017-11-06,123653946,Elaina,We stayed here for 4 nights and it was a great stay. Check-in went smoothly and Eli (who checked us in) was very kind. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious. We had a lot of privacy. The location is good and short distance to public transportation. I️ wish I️ would have brought my own towel to shower as theirs were not very great. There was also a strange odor in our room that we were not able to get rid of.  Aside from this everything else was superb. Overall this place was a fantastic stay for the value and I️ would stay again if I️ were to return to Paris!

7867930,152615617,2017-05-17,90413571,Nilu,"Convenient place to stay. It's just about walking distance to louvre and Norte Dame. Very easy to get to the metro from here. Room itself was very nice and cosy but the shower room and the kitchen was very very small ( it's expected in central Paris tho). 

Checking in and out was fairly easy. However we were told to check out before 11.40am even though the air b&b says no check out time limit. I guess this won't be an issue if you organise a late checkout with the host in advance. We  were happy to checkout at 11.40 and keep our luggages with us. 

All in all It was a good stay. Thanks Adelaide "

665843,103701689,2016-09-23,8605156,Sandie,Gildas was a lovely host for our stay in Paris. We arrived mid-day mid-week so he arranged for his neighbor to let us in and show us the building's security system. The apartment and bathroom were spotless and had everything we needed. He advised us on places to eat in the local neighborhood and how to structure our days seeing the Parisian sights. Unfortunately we had to cut our trip short by a day but Gildas helped us hail a cab to the airport and confirm the set price. We miss the breakfast croissants already. Don't miss the view out his windows of the Eiffel Tower!

The neighborhood was amazing and a quick walk to restaurants Notre Dame and a 4 min walk to the metro! Definitely worth the it!

The location is fantastic and you really feel like you are living like a Parisian :) with many many restaurants and wine bars very close by as well as metro being very close by and tram a minute from the flat. Valentin's communication was perfect. We cant think of anything remotely negative to say as it was really perfect.
I hope I can come back to Paris again soon and stay at Valentins flat where I know I will feel very comfortable and happy."

Las camas del salon no son como en la foto ambas son sofas cama de los que se estiran. Almohadas pobres. En esta época del año mucho calor dentro de la casa ni ventilándola todo el dia se agradeceria algun ventilador mas. No llegamos a ver al dueño ni en la entrada salida ni estancia aunque estuvo atento a los mensajes por la web. Muy buenas comunicaciones.
Cosas a mejorar: menaje de hogar ropa de cama amenities y climatización.
Puntos fuertes: ubicación."

Desventajas: El último día de la estancia irrumpió en la habitación de manera agresiva a los gritos enojada hablando en francés sin poderle entender  porque cuando utilice el baño para la ducha quedó vapor y humedad por el agua caliente.

19619033,185656101,2017-08-22,52656985,Lucas,"This apartment made our short stay in Paris unforgettable. When we arrived Alex gave us a great overview of the city and explained the details of the apartment thoroughly. Cécile had left us a bottle of wine which we were able to enjoy on the beautiful balcony overlooking the city. She also had delicious coffee beans which we were able to grind fresh in the morning and brew in the french press. 
We had access to the kitchen which allowed us to store food and make a few meals easily. Alex was kind enough to bring us delicious baguettes and croissants both mornings we were there as well! During checkout Alex let us keep our bags in the apartment since our flights weren't until later in the evening and we wanted to explore the city more.

After staying in Airbnbs a number of times Alex is the best host we have had. The hospitality balcony and location of this apartment made our stay enjoyable and stress free. Hope to stay here again if ever back in Paris."

4772732,136367224,2017-03-10,72345771,Kelsey,This studio is great. The location is perfect it was very clean and it had all the amenities you'd need. I would mention that it is very small but if you're on vacation you're not spending much time there anyway. Would definitely recommend it overall.
15763909,164192811,2017-06-26,19326423,Pam,Close to 2 metros and a bus station just a few steps from the apartment.  Lots of restaurants and bakeries nearby. It is an interesting and lively neighborhood. The views from the apartment is fantastic. We found the apartment comfortable. If you sleep with the windows open it can be noisy so come prepared with earplugs if you are a light sleeper. My husband and I did not have any problems. Be aware the apartment is on the 5th floor and the building has no lift.  Great communication with Marion who is very helpful.
18387993,369365592,2019-01-10,12990811,Nicole,This apartment is in the best location!  Alyzee is accommodating and prompt to respond.  Would stay here again.
36336868,537240527,2019-09-28,86971978,Bertrand,Bel appartement rénové avec goût propre. Il manque des accessoires comme des portes manteaux ou une penderie. Il est bien situé un quartier agréable. Dommage que la literie soit peu confortable.
15425860,460426123,2019-05-29,5243851,Thomas,"Clean comfortable and conveniently located! 
Eric is a thoughtful and kind host and made sure we were comfortable from our arrival in Paris through check-out. Really enjoyed our stay here!"
19305298,166050332,2017-07-02,6655584,Cristina,"Una ubicación ideal para pasar unos días en París el apartamento es pequeñito pero es ideal para dormir a gusto y al ladito de la Torre Eiffel metro a cuatro pasos ¡una gozada! .

Marguerite es una mujer encantadora nosotros llegamos con un horario muy tardío y nos facilitó el coger las llaves igualmente ha sido muy flexible con la salida y comprensiva.

¡Lo volveré a alquilar seguro!"
26447494,540194841,2019-10-03,102548180,刚,The room is a room in a hotel like all the small hotels in Paris. The location of the hotel is good and can be easily found. If the subway is a good choice the hotel is very close to the subway station. If you drive it's a disaster. There is no refrigerator and kitchen in the room only bed.
3392939,52787678,2015-11-01,32367205,Doriane,"Logement très agréable et surtout très bien situé vraiment à 2 pas de la station Trocadéro. L'appartement est pratique confortable et propre. Jérôme est très prévenant et tout s'est bien déroulé.
Il serait peut-être juste bien de noter dans l'annonce qu'il n'y a pas d’ascenseur. Cela ne nous a pas gêné mais pourrait être embêtant pour certains.
Nous retournerons avec plaisir dans cet appartement pour un autre séjour à Paris !"
14160831,336440120,2018-10-14,134013758,Maria Julia,the location is very good and the apartment amenities also should only charge cleaning fees but ensure a clean apartment as it arrives and I had to clean everything.
19156321,168405113,2017-07-09,5719270,Caroline,Appartement récemment rénové très propre et très fonctionnel.  Métro et RER en bas de l'immeuble. Marie nous avait laissé l'essentiel pour le petit déjeuner. Pas de problème pour l'accueil à l'arrivée. Le canapé lit est confortable et nous avons séjourné à 3 facilement.Un appartement à recommander pour un séjour parisien.

"
1005675,51380291,2015-10-19,45763532,Paul,"We felt very uncomfortable like we we intruding on Patrick's space.  Without a private bathroom connected to the room we are sharing the same bathroom facilities-- and trying to make sure you are not making any noise takes more time to get ready. Knowing that we were traveling with a Baby we were given 2 (Website hidden by Airbnb) hand towel for the bathroom no wash cloths not even avialable for us to ask for an additional towel for the baby or hair etc.  Toilet is in separate room across hall from the shower and sinks. Host fails to mention that while there is parking available he lives in a rental area that has apartments --so dense amount of people and few parking (Website hidden by Airbnb) parking is available for free---if you park your car early in the day and do not move it. When we returned late one night spent 30 mins driving around for a spot...ended up parking on the sidewalk in front of the house--- knocked on hosts door to see if this was ok-- and got yelled at the ""he was sleeping""--- obviously we were not knocking to just chat....  If you aren't willing to be available for questions or have people in your home don't advertise for it.  The room was not cleaned from the guests prior to us-- as there were cigarette ashes and food crumbs on the floor. The Bathroom ceiling and part of the walls is covered in black mold. Thin walls no TV or mask any noise... I would not recommend this particular spot to anyone. We had excellent experiences in the other Air B&B spots we stayed in--Patrick's house was not a pleasant experience. "
20437521,250250555,2018-04-04,172909680,Stacy,Daniel's apartment worked out very well for our family (2 adults 2 teens).  The sofa bed was very comfortable and fit 2 adult sized teens with no issue.  It was centrally located and quiet.  Daniel was very responsive to any questions I had.  We enjoyed our stay!
23643769,343948836,2018-11-02,65342959,Sergio,"The apartment is on a street parallel to the avenue ""Boulevard Saint-Denis"" the street is full of prostitutes and young delinquents (bad people). It is not a safe area at night and I do not recommend it to go as a family with children.
The apartment is very good just as I expected."
1204369,353750255,2018-11-29,9374176,Alison,Daniele's studio is exactly as pictured! It's nothing super fancy but exactly what I needed as a single person traveling in Paris. Daniele met me as I arrived which was extremely helpful. The location is very centrally located next to Metro and about 30min walk to major attractions. I recommend the restaurant Frenchie which is about a 10 min walk away.
4711721,252320261,2018-04-10,7609199,Jessica,This was a wonderful AirBnB! Clean Central easy to get to and check in and check out. Would for sure stay here again.
8011222,114732012,2016-11-20,94845464,Amber,Although the flat was smaller than I expected (living room bed kitchenette small bathroom) it was actually perfect for my needs the weekend that I was there. The flat wasn't impeccably clean but decently so. Using the heater was a must for the cold Paris nights. Fadel was very welcoming and provided me with maps and useful information as well as answering the specific questions I had about breakfast recommendations.  The location is pretty good considering that Paris is such a huge city; however the metro entrance closest to the flat doesn't have machines to buy metro tickets. All in all a good experience in the city of lights!
20219202,521826742,2019-09-01,22032605,Kaisa,The best part of this place is the location - basically right next to Galeries Lafayette and Printemps. The room is large enough for one person and while the bathroom is shared I had no problems with it as I was the only guest at a time - the same goes for the kitchen. The room is also very quiet which is amazing for such a location. Grace was kind and friendly in our communication and when there was a mixup with the cleaning she immediately refunded the cleaning fee. Apart from that misunderstanding the amenities were as advertised.
25795750,427735841,2019-03-24,43728920,Kaydee,Solene and Antoine’s place was lovely!! Their home was in the perfect location for exploring and close to all the main attractions.

22556984,251629664,2018-04-08,4575825,Renee And Freek,We had a great time staying in Florence's amazing apartment. It's a wonderful big bright and clean place to stay. Lovely decorated and a nice kitchen with everything you need to cook at home too. It has a big roofterrace which is really something unique in Paris. The location was great as well close to Garde du Nord when arriving by train and just a couple of metro stops away from the Marais and other central areas. Florence was a really nice and helpful host and took great care of us before and during our stay. She was always available for questions and responds fast. Thank you Florence!
7367189,290363091,2018-07-14,132256090,Wita,Ahmed's place is very strategically located and very close to public transport and attractions. The host is also very responsive. We truly enjoyed our stay
4245705,222286857,2017-12-29,386186,Nicolas,"This flat is in exact conformity to the announcement ( and in Paris  believe me this is not so common...) : Exceptionnal decoration and settings with personal flavours made you feel really at friend's home and made the stay unique and inspiring . A modern feeling inside an old building.
The location is wonderful  between 3 wonderful Parisian districts Le Marais  Republique and Beaubourg. Despite of it it is located in a very quiet street.
Definitively one of the best AirBnB gems we' ve experienced so far."
4622452,250499500,2018-04-05,9106528,Chu-Yun,Max’s apartment is located in the center of Paris near to everywhere we want to go! The apartment is clean and tidy when we arrived and even though it’s in the city center it’s located in a calm area so there is no noise problem at all!
26923583,440729111,2019-04-21,36918655,Amy,Fantastic location! Lively street with everything you need within walking distance. Great communication with our host and easy instructions.  Fan for every room which was a great touch. The apartment was nice and clean with lots of room. It was perfect for a large group. We really enjoyed our stay. I would definitely come back.

4479405,66255212,2016-03-20,18009741,Carla,"Exactly like the pictures! Beautiful small apartment in a fantastic location right by some amazing restaurants close to public transport and great for walking everywhere. Yes the apartment is small and in a 5th floor with no elevator but it is totally worth it! Daniel left towels water bottles some sodas a few snacks guides and a map out for us. The apartment has a computer TV mini fridge microwave and electric kettle. The heater and wifi worked very well. The bathroom was small but amazing the toilet is very fancy (heats up and everything) and the shower has great pressure and temperature. 
Daniel was out of town so he sent a very nice and helpful friend to welcome us at the apartment. I highly recommend staying here we enjoyed our stay very much and hope to return soon!"

1362667,352945316,2018-11-26,66762795,Alyssa,Fantastic flat! Great location super close to the metro station great restaurants and shopping nearby. We were two ladies traveling on our own and felt very safe in the neighborhood. Quentin was there to meet us at check in and the whole thing was very smooth. The other tenants in the building were friendly throughout our stay as well. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this place!

4028574,110288723,2016-10-25,98798922,Claire,The apartment was perfect for a family of 4 (our kids are 11 and 8) for one night. Very comfortable clean and secure in a great area. It wouldn't be good for a family with younger kids as the stairs within the flat are all open but ours are older so it was just fine for us.  Clara was extremely responsive and very helpful. Thank you.

13705258,180066764,2017-08-09,44383770,Pak,This is a beautiful home with plenty of space for the six of us to hang out. We all enjoyed having lunch in the quiet courtyard. The location is excellent there are two metro lines around the corner. We also loved the bakery shop and the super market near by. It's very close to the Euro Star station and has an easy access to the Orly Airport. This is very convenient to us since my in-laws travelled back to London using the Euro Star and we flew to Biarritz to continue our vacation.

11035450,260502485,2018-05-04,180920463,T.K.,Very close to the Eiffel Tower which was a good reference point for when we were walking and unsure which direction to head. Was also very close to the hop on hop off boat tour on the River Seine.

Thank you so much!"
21764962,282342173,2018-06-27,32641423,Shandi,"First of all nice hospitality. Fluent communication. 
The host was super nice response fast and helpful. 

The interior was really cosy cool with good taste nice music and atmosphere. 
People say the host is a smoker but its actually someone downstair or around the flat so if you close window properly should be fine if youre aware of the smell of cigaret. 

Moreover the sound insulation is quite nice if youre worried of the noise outside make sure you close the window and you will be totally fine. 

Location wisely within 3 min to the subway (Parmentier Station); within 30 min you can access to almost anywhere in Paris. Many nice shops in the area lots of cafe and boutiques. Overall highly recommend booking if next time trip to Paris. :)"

263044,31585576,2015-05-07,9404186,Linda,My boyfriend and I have stayed in various Air BnB flats across Europe and I can honestly say that Raphaelle's home was my favorite so far! The place itself is exactly as pictured and the location in St Lazare was perfect to hop onto any metro we needed. We were able to reach any arrondissement really easily. The flat was clean and wifi worked great the windows opening onto the square were amazing and made you feel like you were outside! Secure building with a lift made us feel safe. Would highly recommend Raphaelle as a host and this great home.

Montmartre is a nice area but we found it challenging to find a close spot for breakfast though perhaps with more investigating we would have. Melanie is super fast with response time for messages. We had issues with the locks on entering and heat and she was extremely helpful and fast with both. It was really a great situation where a terrible one could have been. It is clear that they just ran out of the apartment as their belongings abound. It made us wonder where they went! :)
1249964,288993819,2018-07-11,56984915,Hainan,It's a nice little apartment that has nearly everything. I enjoyed the food we cooked when nearby restaurant is closed. The only thing there's is no air-conditioning and it happened to be a bit hot on my first day there. 
21810459,323708376,2018-09-16,17575348,Marissa,"Great Airbnb  tiny space BUT cleaner comes every day which is awesome and changes the towels etc so basically just a hotel stay. Very cool
Location in the 11th arr. great restaurants within walking distance . Would definitely recommend !!! Trendy hotel too"

11439005,65906896,2016-03-17,40670929,Orestis,"The location is excellent just two steps away from St Germain and Odeon across the Jardins de Luxemburg. The area is full of art galleries - museums shopping / Bon Marche + design clothing. 

The building itself is clean and maintained to an excellent standard. Safe at it has two external double doors.

The apartment is beautifully designed by Christina who apart from being a businesswoman in the travel industry for many years is also an artist photographer.

The facilities showers kitchen bathrooms are all brand new and in perfect working condition. Bed is very comfortable.

Most importantly Christinas hospitality was genuine and she helped us with all our queries for our short stay in Paris."

Ns ne l'avons pas rencontré directement mais  Driss est arrangeant en ce qui concerne la remise des clés à l arrivée comme au départ.
Par contre en ce qui concerne le studio il s'apparente plus à un taudis qu'à un studio de charme comme décrit ds l'annonce... Les photos sont loin de correspondre  la réalité...
Rien n'est utilisable tellement que c'est sale (ns avons acheté de la vaisselle en plastique pr manger (froid) sur place) ; bouilloire cafetière micro-ondes et ne parlons pas de la pseudo vaisselle dégueulasses...
Robinet de la cuisine qui ne fonctionne que sur l'eau chaude chasse d'eau qui fuit prise arrachée sols moisis un seul mot pr résumer ce séjour : CAUCHEMARDESQUE...
Ns l'avions loué pr 4 nuits et y sommes restées car pas les moyens de louer autre chose ms c'est une honte de proposer des trucs pareils !
Le propriétaire promet de grands travaux ms il faudrait d'abord commencer par un bon nettoyage.
Si vs voulez gâchés votre séjour à Paris allez-y !!!"
4217209,294422023,2018-07-22,4246614,Lisa,Brigitte et Guy ont été très accueillants ils ont rapidement répondu à ma demande de réservation et ont été très arrangeants pour nous donner les clefs au plus vite (ils habitent dans l'appartement à côté ce qui facilite l'organisation). L'appartement est lumineux propre agréable le lit confortable. Le quartier de Jourdain est idéal pour découvrir Paris avec ses nombreuses boutiques et épiceries sur la rue de Belleville et le parc des Buttes Chaumont pour se reposer après de longues balades parisiennes. Je recommande !

5408527,263501558,2018-05-12,28323683,Marisol,"Sobre el piso : no me gustó la limpieza  sinceramente yo he pagado 25€ de limpieza y me esperaba que esté mejor  tenía pólvo. Además olía mal porque el baño está cerca .  El baño no tiene puerta por lo que es algo incómodo de tener intimidad . La cama bastante incómoda el piso está más bien pensado para uno . 

Por otro lado tiene transporte muy cerca que te lleva en poco al centro  además tiene supermercados y bares cerca ."

The apartment is perfect: clean and spacious and  close to centre of Paris next to the metro in a lively neighborhood but in a quiet street. 

We had a great stay and would definitely recommend Lily's place. In fact we would love to stay again next time we're in Paris!"

1429609,227807936,2018-01-16,73872289,Merrilee,A tranquil oasis set back in a courtyard in a bustling neighbourhood. Great area close to everything. The kitchen is very basic & small but there are many restaurants close by. Ideal for 3 people.

The only thing for travelers to know is that in the evening there are many homeless families around. None of them were ever mean or aggressive at all  it just came to me as a surprise as I didn't see any during the day. But honestly I cannot give Viktor and Elsa's place enough praise it was phenomenal!!!! 
530288,6872465,2013-08-28,6799923,Ruma,"For a first time airbnb experience in Paris it couldn't have been easier. Nicolas' apartment is very central - just a step across from Bir Hakeim metro station which made travel so easy. Nicolas himself is super organized & very helpful. He quickly responds by email etc on any queries & has a list of FAQs answered from supermarkets to eateries nearby.
His flat is small but perfectly run; we were 4 including my boys one night & all slept comfortably (boys on the sofa bed). There are table fans for summer a couple if supermarkets Franprix & Monoprix just 5 minutes away. Don't miss a meal at Cafe Michel. Small & good. 
Will be back. Most professional booking interaction. Will be back. "

3145333,51032973,2015-10-17,820274,Christina,For a family of 5 adults Blandine's place was perfect. We really liked the New Yorker style of the apartment and the interior decoration. The combined kitchen and living room provided a great common area for a family to spend time together. The neighborhood was nice and had all commodities at the door step butcher bakeries vegetables wine cheese deli as well as a beautiful church around the corner. It was very easy to get to the center with the next door metro. Blandine was always very friendly and Raffaella from the service company who handed us the key was also very helpful and flexible about our checkin. When we had trouble with the water & heat Blandine and her husband Emmanuel were quick to fix it and made sure we had a great stay! Thanks for having us!!!

16737380,472756076,2019-06-20,27362626,Saloni,"Claire's apartment is so typically Parisien that I would recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic experience. Very clean and very well located. Picard Carrefour express and Franprix are all located in walking distance along with a great bakery just downstairs. 

Any sight is not more than half an hour from the apartment by metro. The kitchen is self sufficient and if push comes to shove you can cook small meals there! 

Claire is easy to get in touch with and was able to answer any queries I had prior to our arrival to my satisfaction.

There is a reason why she is a superhost"

Michael is very responsive as a host  we requested more towels and they were delivered. 
There is an ironing board but no iron. 
A place is nice  but needs a good tidy  I don't think cleaning was done before we arrived . 
Beds were comfortable but bed linen is not of great quality. 
Shower was clogged with hair on our arrival.

Le studio est très bien situé  à proximité de tous commerces  à peu de distance  du Jardin du Luxembourg  des stations de métro donc parfait pour rayonner dans Paris.
Véronique m'a très bien accueilli elle m'a dit être là si besoin.

9387646,330215219,2018-09-30,16340846,Kristin,Lovely apt great view of Sacre Coeur.  Quiet and contemporary.  The stairs are a bit of a challenge especially with a large (Website hidden by Airbnb) be truthful it was tough with the smaller ones (Website hidden by Airbnb) the stairs narrow as you go up.
8020842,435328591,2019-04-10,40105775,Kaela,"We had a lovely stay at Remy's flat. Sébastien did our check in and was very informative as to the local area and places we could go/eat/see.
The area itself we really liked not too busy.
The flat was great clean and nice to be in. It had everything you could need including a hair dryer washing machine clothes airer hoover. Bed was very comfortable. Second floor steps up are narrow and quirky but we loved these :)
So many places to go around here within walking distance. Parfait!"
23640110,426474324,2019-03-21,246897300,Ayu,The place was phenomenal. It had everything that we had needed (with the bonus of a washer and dryer!) Secluded very private modern and stylish great views even had a handbook guide for local places to eat. Eric takes his time to make hosts feel welcome & it truly showed through our stay with him. He has made our Paris trip memorable and would stay at this Airbnb again. Would recommend!

L'appartement a tout pour un séjour tranquille. Tous les nouveaux ustensiles appartement bien rangé bon lit douche chaude et beaucoup d'eau. Rue calme et tranquille. Quoi qu'il en soit c'est un appartement parfait pour ceux qui ont besoin de passer quelques jours à Paris. Je reviendrais 100 fois dans l'appartement de Marie s'il le fallait. De plus nous avons été accueillis par son mari Vitor qui parle le portugais ce qui a tout simplifié. Vitor était très poli et nous a laissé notre départ. Vitor et Marie sont des hôtes parfaits. Je recommanderai toujours cet espace à des amis. Merci Vitor et Marie. Tout était parfait !!

16120952,471227817,2019-06-17,236549328,Kathleen,Apartment is close to Champs Elysees and the Presidential Palace.  Two bedroom one bath on first floor.  Quiet except for the faint rumbling of the subway which really did not bother me and I have sensitive ears.  Josephine met us at the apartment (even though we were late because of Friday afternoon traffic).  She answered our questions and made helpful suggestions.  I highly recommend this sophisticated apartment.
312437,205457670,2017-10-22,5066930,Colin,Pascale's apartment is a perfect Airbnb. Having stayed in many this was great. Very clean and comfortable. All of the things you'd really hope for right down to easy-to-use locks on the door (which can sometimes be a hassle). The location is spectacular and it's great to have a first floor apartment after a long day. You can walk anywhere in Paris from here but the Sentier metro is right around the corner. It's less than 10 minutes to the Etienne Marcel metro as well. The bed was very comfortable and clean. Bathroom was perfectly clean. Everything was wonderfully appointment. For two people we couldn't have felt more at home here. Pascale was prompt with all communications and the arrangement of arrival and departure was as easy as could be. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and would absolutely recommend it.

10587126,172597603,2017-07-21,133245919,Christopher,This flat was ideal for a short stay. My girlfriend and I were after somewhere central and close to public transports so ticked the boxes there. Augusta messaged with clear instructions for locating and getting into the flat which was really helpful. She also messaged mid stay to ensure we found our stay was going well. Bathroom is a little tired and dated and there was a few bits that could have done with a quick wipe but it was a good place to stay. 
7420529,96678217,2016-08-23,4727161,Janaka,"Amazing location perfectly situated for the Louvre and Musee D'Orsay.

The apartment is very clean and spacious might perhaps benefit from a little modernisation but this is hardly a deal-breaker.

We were met by one of the agency staff who patiently waited for us as we arrived 30 mins after expected.  We see given a short tour of the apartment a little info on the area and advised how to access the apartment (simple).

There's a small Carrefour 1 minutes away and some good restaurants - of note is a Ramen/Japanese place.

If anything could be improved it's a few minor things - one bathroom could do with a shower curtain we couldn't find any dishcloths to dry cutlery ... that's all I can think of!

We were happy with all the communication with the agency - they  were very responsive and allowed to check out a little later than contracted to.

All in all very happy with our stay."

The apartment which is beautiful is situated in a lovely part of the city thats easily accessible to any other part of Paris. There's a great bakery on the corner and a very convenient mini market. The metro is only a few mins walk and there are a couple of bus lines close by which we also used frequently. The apartment is bring and airy (looks exactly like the pictures) its spacious clean and modern. The bed was so comfortable and a dream to come home to after a long day out. Lilian is wonderful and friendly. She greeted us and checked us in and was always available for anything we needed during our stay. 
Paris is filled with so much to see and we will defiantly return ... and of course we will stay at Lilian's :) "

The room is very tidy and she provides all you need.  the decoration of the room is very French style. Importantly here is very quite and safe and closer to the tower Eiffel. I definitely will come back if I have chance.
11507093,203167186,2017-10-14,42781583,Rebecca,This was the perfect place for me. Dominique's apartment is a beautiful old Parisian place that is very spacious. The balcony has a view of Sacre Coeur!

772556,35555094,2015-06-20,6352987,Codruta,My two friends and I stayed in Edouard´s apartment for 2 nights in June 2015. The apartment is absolutely perfectly located in a lively area close to the Opera Montmartre etc-  yet relatively quiet charming street area with lots of cafes shops and restaurants around. The apartment in itself is very clean and tastefully decorated. One of the highlights was the terrace wonderful for enjoying breakfast outside. The communication with with Edouard was very prompt and informative smooth check-in/out. Highly recommended would definitely go back again.

6421188,259961673,2018-05-03,17619313,Pankaj,Wonderful space in the heart of Paris. We were able to get to all the great sights by walking or metro. The space isn't huge (according to West Coast American Standards) but it was clean and well designed. The bathroom is a bit tight but there was great water pressure. It is a great option for one or two people looking to stay on the heart of the city. The host is very nice and accommodating.

Even so it's still do-able. My sister and I loved our stay here and we would definitely stay here again! Merci

It's walking distance to Sacre Coeur and many bakeries and food/drinks. We landed in Paris late but the host was still very accomodating and stayed up for us. Thanks for the great hospitality Paola and Bryan!

25774560,297332789,2018-07-27,33787871,Presylia,"Please be careful with this host. I was very discontented by the way the booking was handled by Vikyath. I booked for three nights at Vikyath’s place. After my booking was accepted - I have to stress that it was not an automatic booking so someone had to push a button - I received a message from Vikyath asking me to call him on What's App. I did so to hear that the room was not available for the night because he was there. Apparently he didn't realise that I booked the place for the same night. He said it was free for the two other nights but not for that night. He proposed that I shared the appartement with him for the night which I refused. I booked for a full appartement because that was what I needed not for a room. I was a bit down because I was at CDG airport looking for a place to head to before I took off. Tired and understanding and and told him I'll find another place. I asked him if he could cancel because it would cost me money if I did because of the cancellation policy he chose to which he responded that he would look into it. I started looking for an other place and found it. To my surprise I then received a message from Vikyath on What's App telling me that I could stay and asking me what time I was planning to arrive. First I didn't feel welcome anymore and didn't want anything to do with the him then second I had already taken another commitment. I told him so. To which he responded that he could not cancel because it would cost him 50% cancellation charges. I told him I didn't want to come anymore and that I couldn't get bothered by this because it just came back to Paris for funerals and didn't have energy to spend on that matter. I conceded to cancel just to end it even though I was loosing money. His answer was ""Sure"" ""I let you cancel!"". I felt that it wasn't right. At a sad moment in my life I give in to pay for a situation I am not responsible for just to get peace. And the answer I get is ""Sure"". My money I didn't pick from a tree but it would be ok that I loose it so easily when he who is responsible for the situation is not willing to pay for anything. I then told him I would rather complain to Airbnb. I asked for a cancellation on his behalf. Which I didn't get. Vikyath lied about the fact that he first told me the room was not free. Because of his lying and pretending that he was waiting for me to come and I didn't show Airbnb cancelled on my behalf. There was no proof of the phone conversation we had on What's App which accounted for his responsibility so he..."

Balconies with direct views of the Eiffel tower. Great hospitality and lots of great recs. <5 min walk away from the metro stop and one block away from a street with lots of amenities including a great bakery we grabbed a bite at every morning. Highly recommend this place.

27198698,453646450,2019-05-16,110706769,Rodrigo,We really enjoyed our trip to Paris and the apartment was key to our great experience. We had everything we needed including excellent attention for check in and check out a great design and the perfect location! It’s a real pleasure to book through Airbnb with an apartment and service like Stanley’s!
33031803,465180483,2019-06-07,9472837,Wenli,The apartment is fairly true to the photos. But everything else about my stay was disappointing. When I arrived at the Airbnb I was unable to check in for more than 20 minutes as the instructions were not provided in advance despite my requests. Host claims they were sent but did not offer proof. Trying to figure where to find the lockbox and how to get in the building while standing outside in heavy rain at night with the host on the phone and with lots of street noise from passing cars was exceptionally stressful. Matthew also became short with me while on the phone and his tone made me feel that I was inconveniencing him. Upon entering the building I then found that the elevator was broken requiring me to carry my luggage up six flights of stairs. I alerted the host to the issue as soon as I entered the apartment. He said he'd call building management to find out when it would be fixed but I did not hear from the host again after that. Each day of my visit required walking up and down six flights of stairs multiple times thankfully I was staying at this Airbnb for only two days. The bathroom doorknob was also broken which host knew about and did not fix -- advising me to just not close the door. After booking this Airbnb Matthew also requested communicating on an app outside of the Airbnb platform which I should have declined but unfortunately did not think much of it at the time. I recommend all future guests keep communication within Airbnb and ensure they receive check in instructions at least 1-2 days in advance. The broken elevator was likely not Matthew's fault but he made no attempts to correct the situation or follow up with me on the status. While these issues are probably not typical overall I would still not recommend this Airbnb to anyone.

Solo te contactan con una empresa BnbSitter absolutamente impersonal y negligentes. 45 min de espera en la Calle al llegar! Además nos dice que ella encuentra que el dpto está un poco sucio!... todas las veces que me comuniqué con ellos fueron personas distintas. Para irnos no podían entender que necesitábamos hacer check out muy temprano por nuestro vuelo! Todo el día por paris pendiente del teléfono porque insistían que era a las 11! Que no podían mandar a nadie antes y tampoco podíamos dejar la llave sobre la mesa... 
con este tipo de empresas se pierde el espíritu de Airbnb. Además deberían explicitar que el departamento està en uso!"

25970096,285615473,2018-07-04,103231742,Benjamin,This apartment worked extremely well for our family of 4.   It was great to have 2 bedrooms and 2 showers in the apartment.  The location was as great as we enjoyed local restaurants and boulangeries.  It is on a busy street and so it is pretty loud with the windows open (it was pretty hot in Paris while we were there) but nothing unusual for staying in the center of a large city. The apartment is represented accurately on the Airbnb website.

Close to metro and a cute grocery store that is open late so if you arrive late you can get some fruits and veggies plus Asian homemade cuisine :) Would definitely stay there again. The only thing is that the walls are thin so bring earplugs to not hear the neibours ;)
2444138,347254209,2018-11-11,6140289,Kim,This was a superb choice for our group of 4 as we all traveled to Paris via different routes/arrival times so the code check-in was fab and each person could just drop their bags themselves. Gilian was very responsive. The location is great. The space itself is practical but basic. I was only in Paris for 26hrs so it was perfect for my needs and as Paris can be pricey a good choice for a group of friends!

7619189,448478435,2019-05-05,72275109,Anca,"Sadly my experience at Sarah’s house was very unpleasant as there were issues with checking in ( I was offered the possibility to get the keys from her cousin that worked on the other side of town ) there was a dirty towel in the room house rules are available on the website but only in French cleaning was questionable and you have notices everywhere that you have to clean after yourself ( which doesn’t make you feel very welcome). Apparently you are also expected to change your bedding before departure.

Before booking I suggest reading the reviews as you will  find a lot of similar information there.

Sarah did try to help to a certain extent and was very communicative but there were too many issues for me to accept."

9270346,284915467,2018-07-02,57732466,Steve,Nous étions deux couples à visiter Paris pour une semaine. Cet appartement est vraiment très bien situé à quelques pas du métro à 10 minutes de marches des Invalides et de la Tour Eiffel. Il y a de nombreux cafés et restaurants à proximité. La descriptions des propriétaires et les photos reflètent parfaitement ce que nous retrouvons dans l’appartement. La propreté de l’appartement est à souligner. Nous avons été très bien accueilli tôt le matin et les propriétaires ont su nous accommodé en fonction de notre heure d’arrivée. Seule ombre au tableau. La douche d’une des salles de bain ne fonctionnait pas. Il a donc fallu partager la douche qui était dans la chambre de nos amis. Nous aurions aimé être informé avant notre arrivée étant donné que le problème datait de quelques jours. Cela aurait évité quelques frustrations. Nous devons cependant souligner que lorsque nous lui avons signaler la situations Achille a prestement réagi et nous a offert un dédommagement pour les inconvénients. Merci beaucoup et nous recommandons sans hésitation cet appartement pour un séjour dans la très belle ville de Paris. ALLEZ LES BLEUS BATTEZ LA CROATIE...

18209997,489080120,2019-07-16,89847038,Ruth,It’s a nice location but the building is very old and a bit smelly. The stairs are many and steep so carrying suitcases up is hard. The lock on the apt door was almost impossible to use. The apt is only appropriate for couples in the queen bed. The foldout couch is uncomfortable and takes up the entire living room. No paper towels. No corkscrew. I wouldn’t stay here again.

20203352,201861025,2017-10-09,78589003,Guilherme,Ficamos bem acomodados neste local. Uma pessoa a pedido do anfitrião nos recebeu muito bem e explicou algumas funcionalidades do apartamento. O local estava limpo e os quartos eram confortáveis. Fica localizado a uns 350 metros do metrô. A residência acomoda bem quatro pessoas porém não tem mesa pra comer exceto pela bancada que acomoda apenas uma pessoa como mostra as fotos. Achamos o apartamento um pouco barulhento uma vez que você consegue ouvir os passos do vizinho de cima. Do apartamento da de ver o topo da torre e fica próximo a ela pendendo ir a pé do apartamento. Check-out prático.
30821252,441774915,2019-04-22,10878853,Allen,Great location if this is the area you are interested in being in. I had an event at the Hyatt right next door. Bed is a fold out so you can feel the bars beneath. That said it will probably be fine for you if you're not picky. I prefer hotel quality beds. Nice window to interior courtyard of building. I enjoyed it.
31877997,430966316,2019-03-31,152818282,Bertrand,Nous sommes très satisfaits de notre séjour. Les hôtes très sympathiques nous ont bien accueillis et renseignés dès notre arrivée. Même s'il est assez petit l'appartement est bien agencé propre calme et confortable. Les 2 couchages sont de bonne qualité. L'emplacement est également idéal dans un quartier vivant.
1647495,208635350,2017-11-02,54433972,Carrie,Besides the breakfast being delicious the room was very cleanand  it was easy to get to the metro. Really enjoyed staying at Catherine’s place. Catherine is easy to work with and very friendly.
770556,23943031,2014-12-15,11878851,Catarina,This is a great house in an amazing location! Just what we needed for a weekend in Paris. All the 4 rooms are all good size with large windows in a secluded condominium. Tres chic!! We all loved it and felt safe and comfortable. If you have a big group this is the place for you - plenty of common space but same time privacy as all rooms have bathroom. Shame about the weather but we definitely want to be back to enjoy the amazing roof terrace. Deborah was in touch throughout the w/e making sure we had all we needed. Thank you for being such a great host. Everyone really wants to come back … as soon as the weather warms up! A bientot!
1103753,492373372,2019-07-21,260250205,Massimo,Cozy place in a good location the owner was really flexible with the check-in what made our stay nice and comfortable.
13876862,122234595,2016-12-22,60957594,Rebecca,Anne is an amazing host and was very accommodating to our check in times when we needed it changed due to flight delays. The apartment is exactly as advertised and is an amazing location: very close to Le Louvre Le Marais and other sites as well. The area felt very safe and there are many good places to eat right on the same street! Also a great distance from the Metro!
699063,6512308,2013-08-15,7157199,Steve,We are a family of six and  Cecile's apartment provided lots of room plenty of light and wonderful Paris ambiance.  The apartment is located in a very nice Paris neighbourhood.There are plenty of shops to buy; fruits and veggies cheeses meats and baguettes. There is also a grocery store restaurants and shopping in the neighbourhood. The metro is about a 5-10 min walk. WE WOULD RECOMMEND AND GO BACK TO CECILE'S APARTMENT FOR A REAL PARISIAN EXPERIENCE.
17840098,508715753,2019-08-13,268811240,Mark,Great place; very easy.   This was the first stop on a complicated multi city vacation with a lot of opportunities for things to go wrong.  Daniel’s place was a great first step on this trip.  It was easy to find well-maintained  and there was good communication.  The layout of the apartment is as described and the photos on the site are accurate.  The apartment is located in charming and safe part of the City.  It was convenient to most of what we wanted to see (it’s about 4 blocks from the Eiffel Tower and 6 from the Les Invalides.).  We were VERY pleased and have no hesitation rented again if we come back to Paris.   Thank you so much for a wonderful stay.
5336313,30155998,2015-04-18,11008999,Michel,Great place to stay: very central stone's throw from Canal St Martin lots of pubs and restaurants in the area and only about 5 mins walk to the metro (and 15 from gare du Nord). The apartment is exactly as described: not too big but with all you might need for a comfortable stay in Paris (even a well-equiped kitchen!). Romain and his girlfriend were very friendly and helpful thanks again!

22980552,320754196,2018-09-09,23363497,Kristin,Easily the coolest Airbnb I’ve had the pleasure of staying in. Super hip elevated design cozy airy and comfortable. I was advised by some Parisian friends that this apartment was literally right on the divide between two very different parts of town so I knew what to expect but to those looking for the quintessential “Montmartre experience” you might be a little surprised by the vibe of the *immediate* neighborhood to the east. But I’m telling you: DON’T BE DETERRED because if that’s what you’re looking for its literally one block up the street and the location of the apartment itself is so perfect as it’s right next to the metro and is surprisingly walkable. Everything about the apartment itself is perfect. The terraces are a dream they clearly have great taste in art & interior design— an inspirational place to stay in the most romantic city. Elsa and her boyfriend were very responsive and welcoming and their recommendations were perfect. A++
6111649,222952016,2017-12-31,15447086,Diego,"Our stay at Christine's place was wonderful! 

The apartment is nicely decorated and has all the amenities necessaries for a short stay in Paris.  The location is great: only a few minutes away from a subway station around 20 minutes from the Louvre and Gare du Nord station and a bit more than 30 minutes from the Sacré-Cœur. Also the neighborhood is very safe and with a lot of restaurants and cafes nearby.

Christine was a nice host and always quick to respond to all our messages. The check-in and check-out processes were really straightforward. 

We would definitely stay again at this place in our next visit to Paris if we have the chance. Totally recommended!"
18053362,213192674,2017-11-20,124241115,Gerardo,The place is very well located and it has everything to make your stay in París a lot easier you can cook ir have a nice bath in a tub... Also you have restaurantes cafés brasserie and all the stuff that you would expect from París within a walk of 5 minutes. Also having a transport hub within a 10 minute walk is very convinient. Would stay there again if i get to París again.
21114242,284191223,2018-07-01,25905331,Rieke,Enjoyed our stay in the room of Catharine. Location is very very nice; boulangeries for breakfast and bars in the evening. A park is close to enjoy a good picnic. Although the room is small we did have everything we needed. Shower was very nice. Recommend as a sleeping place for a busy city trip :)
14893233,121998343,2016-12-20,26206892,Ladislav,"This apartment was amazing and just as described. Our hosts were really helpful they let us leave our bags at their own apartment (since we arrived early) and after gave us a later check-out. Especially we appreciated breakfast supplies (cereal milk juice jam fruits tea and coffee) and cooking supplies.
The location is very nice it is just near Sacre Cour and has a lot of markets shops close by and even a post office downstairs in the building. There is also a bus and a metro stop in walking distance. 
Everything was clean and tidy. The building has an elevator. Towels and hair dryer were provided."

We had a great experience the only thing we were sorry about was that we arrived there very late and left really early so did not get to enjoyed it for longer!"

22502180,257408131,2018-04-26,176736917,François,Je recommande vivement Isabelle. Sont appartement est bien situé avec un ascenseur et vous ne serez pas réveillé par le bruit. Isabelle est très occupé mais malgré cela elle reste disponible si vous la croisez dans l’appartement.
37312354,516195587,2019-08-24,196468986,Hyesun,Location wise this place is not too bad. They gave us incorrect check in information which caused us some inconveniences. Other than water not draining well in the shower my overall experience at this airbnb was ok. But two days after check out the host accused me of damaging the place which I didn’t do. If I were you I would take pictures of the place right before check out. Or you could do yourself a favor and book another place.
23870586,427294043,2019-03-23,20296859,Jenny,The Communication with Nora was very well all the time! I got quick answers when I had a question. The location was wonderful a nice walk away from the Eiffel tower. The only flaw was the smell in the bedrooms: it was a little stuffy and musty but that was because you couldn‘t open the Window there and the blankets were relatively old. Otherwise it was a very nice stay and very suitable for six persons.
7077872,41403725,2015-08-07,35224075,George,"Wonderful apartment. Very close to the main station which was a blessing after our long journey. 
The communication with Marie Astrid was excellent as were the directions and tourist information provided.
I travelled to Paris with my wife and 2 young children and we all absolutely loved this apartment. The use of space is great it is very child friendly and is equipped with everything you need. The location is superb very close to 2 metro stations.
Marie Astrid has a lovely home. I would highly recommend the host and this listing."

4538931,453595063,2019-05-16,7500138,Maika,Thank you Casper! We had a wonderful time in your charming apartment not very far from the Place de la Republique. We had all we need for a very comfortable stay – from bed linen to a toaster. Your kind advices were very helpful and made us feel welcome! We would love to come back.
20878679,217760643,2017-12-10,145615561,Daniel,Fantastic value for money! Everything you need when travelling. Will definetly use again!
40899,37851282,2015-07-11,7524668,Will,Lola was a very gracious host and she had a lovely apartment with nice light and good air flow with the windows open. The location near Canal Saint-Martin and a few other strips that Lola was kind enough to point out to us we're great places to visit while in Paris. It was conveniently located near a couple Metros as well. The host was very accommodating with our arrival and departure times and very quick to answer our questions. The apartment was laid out nicely and had everything we needed including walls filled with many many books which though we were unable to ready as our french is poor contributed to the cosy and bright feeling of the space.
2668473,93014514,2016-08-11,38593691,Jennifer,Marc was friendly and helpful. The place was very clean and in a great location. It was perfect for our 2 night stay in Paris. Would definitely recommend. 
23139160,516420114,2019-08-24,171764051,Sihem,Nous n’avons pas pu rencontrer Riad notre hôte à cause de nos horaires décalées mais il nous a bien informé via les messages. L’appartement était très propre et très confortable bien équipé. Riad a laissé aussi toutes les infos pour le transport ce qui a un côté très pratique. A noter le stationnement extérieur est gratuit durant le mois d’août. On le recommande vivement.
1588792,321803623,2018-09-11,41892591,Reinis,Location is super good in heart of Paris close to Notre Dame and Pompedu center. Great stay if You are 2 persons. If more dont stay because sofa in livingroom is totally uncomfortable ( made from metal) and must be changed. Bed in sleeping room is good and can be used.  Host Olivier is friendly and helpfull. All was clean. Problematic location with car because it is historical center. Not easy stay with infant because of steep and narrow stairs.  Otherwise perfect place to stay for two people!

2709330,129345730,2017-01-30,20877905,Noa,"Awesome apartment! right in the center of Paris we walked almost everywhere we wanted to visit and we had tons of restaurants and bars to choose from just outside the apartment. 
The apartment was just ideal for our needs as 3 adults and we had everything we needed in the apartment including very good heating for a cold January visit. 
Patrice was super nice and helped us with everything we needed including a late check out at 7 pm!
will definitely recommend this lovely apartment in the heart of Paris."
12769822,201411009,2017-10-08,18649139,Pedro,Thierry was very kind and worried about our stay. The place is in a very good area several metros near by and in a walking distance from Marais.

32156137,539345731,2019-10-01,3703288,Kim,"check was a nightmare!!!
My friend sat outside for an hour and a half.
Host double booked them self then turned up with the wrong keys.
They couldn’t find our booking.
This is run by a separate company to Airbnb so it is not personal. You have a different person speaking to you each time. Which makes it difficult to get things resolved.
We had no hot water or WiFi for first day and a half.
They did get this resolved.
Apartment living area is very big and spacious.
Bedrooms are small and not as luxurious as I would expect for such a high priced apartment.
Towards the end of our stay a cleaner turned up with no notice given. He had a key and tried to key him self in. My friend was asleep and woken by him banging the door until she answered. 
If she hadn’t double locked the door he would have come in whilst she was asleep.
We were unaware of this unexpected guest. Although it’s great the apartment is cleaned notice should be given."
18082111,207871058,2017-10-30,5259653,Patrick,The apartment is nice and centrally located. Our host was understanding about our check in times. Rue Montorgueil is a 2-4 minute walk from the apartment.

20946185,197322096,2017-09-25,150735173,Ivan,The apartment is located in a very nice neighborhood with nice bars and restaurants. The view from the window is beautiful most of all you can see the top of Sacre Coeur! Just what we were looking for spending a few days in Paris. Also Albert has been a great host and took care of everything since the beginning definitely will recommend it and go back for another weekend!

25645950,354771170,2018-12-02,126021301,Juls,We were disappointed.  The photos on Airbnb were NOT the apartment we booked.  The location space of the apartment comfort of beds and water pressure were awesome.  Everything else was not.  When they say that the kitchen is fully stocked that is not accurate.  Very sparse items.  The heater in one of the bedrooms was not hooked up and didn’t work.  Paint was peeling off the walls in every room.  Hair dryers were included in all bathrooms but only worked in living room.  Freezer needed to be thawed out!  All furniture and hard wood floors were very used & abused.  There were no wash towels for face & body.  Only large towels.  A few of the light fixtures would flicker constantly.  In one of the bathrooms you could barely sit on the toilet because of the spacing.  We were only there for 3 days and only 4 people so we made it work.  Again the location was super!  Kitty corner to Four Seasons and blocks from Sein River and 15 minutes to Eiffel Tower!!
9890486,84384319,2016-07-07,55362293,Anna,Vi hade en härlig semester i lägenheten. Allt som man behövde fanns. Lägenheten var i bra standard. Tråkigt att vi inte fick träffa Karin som var bortrest men blev trevligt bemöt av Eva Karins barnflicka. Toppen.

Un po’ scomoda per mangiare dentro casa... ma per una colazione c’è tutto.

Etienne foi um excelente anfitrião: atencioso cuidadoso nos deu informações claras e precisas sobre o apartamento sobre o bairro (localização de supermercados estações de metro pontos de ônibus) nos aguardou no studio apesar do atraso do nosso voo.
O studio era exatamente como descrito (me surpreendi pois pessoalmente ele é muito maior) arejado amplo muito limpo confortável seguro tem todos os itens necessários. A localização do studio é perfeita!! O bairro é lindo! Íamos andando para a Torre Eiffel a vizinhança é muito agradável transportes públicos próximos e de fácil acesso.
Recomendo a todos o studio do Etienne. Será meu endereço sempre que retornar a Paris :)
Obrigada Etienne!! Nós tivemos dias maravilhosos em Paris.
My experience in the studio Etienne far outweighed my expectations. Etienne was an excellent host: attentive careful gave us clear and accurate information about the apartment about the neighborhood (location of supermarkets metro stations bus stops) waited in the studio despite the delay of our flight. 
The studio was exactly as described (surprised because personally it is much higher) airy spacious very clean comfortable safe has all the necessary items. The location of the studio is perfect !! The neighborhood is beautiful! We went walking to the Eiffel Tower the neighborhood is very nice near public transport and easy access. 
Recommend to all the studio Etienne. Will my address when returning to Paris :)"

It contains also many things you need (towels hair drier kitchen utensils very interesting books...). The apartment is absolutely suitable for four persons because there is a double bed a convertible couch for two persons and an extra sofa. 
Boris is a very interesting and friendly person and took his time to give us detailed insider tips for our trip (bars museums walks...). 
All in all Boris' apartment is a special place in Paris which I can recommend to everybody!"

It was exactly like the pictures and our son really enjoyed playing with all the toys in the children's room. Spacious and within walking distance to both Gare de Nord and Louvren which was perfect. Michal placed a very useful map on the table when we came with the most valuable supermarkets restaurants and so on in the neighbourhood. We did use the fine Boulangerie more then once :). Big positive was also the great fish shop just down the street. 
It was a bit noise from the street but it was Friday/Saturday night during Football championship so... 
I would definitely book the apartment if ever in Paris again!!! 
Everything was very smooth with the key (picked up in agreed place) no worries of us being late. 
Michal could be very proud and happy about renting out her apartment!"
12159796,252022273,2018-04-09,90341527,George,We spent a week at Jean Francois's lovely apartment and had a wonderful experience.  The location in the Latin Quarter is great near numerous tourist sights (Notre Dame the Seine River The Pantheon the Sorbonne etc) a Metro stop numerous restaurants retail shopping (and grocery) etc. etc.  The area can be busy active and loud but the apartment is on a quiet little street and insulated away from all the hustle and bustle.  We totaled five people and there was a great use of space there (spread out over four split-levels) and we never felt crowded.  It was truly a gem!

1029443,276290827,2018-06-13,56856944,Alexander,Franck's apartment is located in a typical Parisian neighborhood just outside the center of Paris. The location was convenient and there are plenty of great restaurants and bakeries within walking distance. The apartment was exactly as Franck had described it - it was clean well-equipped and had everything we needed for our stay. The door to the shower is pretty narrow and may be difficult for people of a larger build to get into but we had no problems and had plenty of towels and even shampoo. Franck is extremely organized which was especially seen in a laminated binder he left behind that had descriptions of nearby restaurants stores attractions and even taxi phone numbers that we used. The location was close enough to the city center that it was possible to walk all the way to the 1st district. The only difficulty we had was finding the actual apartment within the building (possibly our own fault) in which a kind neighbor pointed us towards the right direction but we advise guests to clarify where to go and how to get into the building and apartment (Franck responds very quickly). Overall we had a great trip and are looking forward to returning to Paris soon.

933347,28624380,2015-03-27,29337286,Ken,Pierre and Duncan were the best hosts I could have hoped for on my first trip to Paris and Europe in general.  They were helpful polite kind and very knowledgeable about every inquiry I had during my stay.  The room and facilities were also excellent and I would highly recommend them to anyone thinking of booking a stay in Paris.  Their location by the canal was very central to all the locations I was hoping to visit and I ended up walking to many of them without needing to take transit.  Thank you so much Pierre and Duncan for making my stay so memorable. Hopefully I get a chance to visit Paris and you two in the near future!

Everything we required was on hand help with any enquires was immediately responded to and the description exactly matched the accommodation and surrounding area of Montmartre. Chris and Laetitia are excellent host's who are ready to aide your stay in any way they can. There are so many local amenities shops restaurants transport (no80 bus into Paris centre stops outside the flat!) Lamark metro station is literally minutes away. 
Thank you Chris and Laetitia xx"

Bottle of wine waiting upon arrival was great and much needed after walking 10 miles the first day :) Claire was very easy to get a hold of and quick at responding. A great stay and look forward to returning one day! Thank you Claire!

Amazing restaurants downstairs and it was nice to be just out of the noisy and busy city center. The window opened to a private courtyard which was peaceful and private. Frank and Viviane had great restaurant and transport suggestions and were so pleasant to interact with!
13703198,467352242,2019-06-10,33411216,Philipp,Corinne runs a Charming little flat with garden which is hard to find in Paris. Nevertheless we didn’t not feel welcome and she had very early visitors ( 6 am 7 am). The bed was in a very poor condition and she requested from us to stop showering. In addition the bathroom is very narrow and was not cleaned properly. I would recommend this place if you are on a budget and are okay with the described conditions.

13765539,128224572,2017-01-23,43510310,Charles,Just the perfect Paris location - the flat is in a beautiful peaceful cobbled street with a Montmartre windmill at the top and lovely cafes and independent creative shops in the surrounding streets. Rue le Pic is full of lovely bigger stores and restaurants and fish and fruit and veg stores and Blanche is a great metro stop  just a 5 minute walk away. We will definitely come again.

There are plenty of bars and cafes within walking distance and a nice bakery across the street.  The metro is just a short walk around the corner so it was easy to get around Paris.  We even got to check in early which was especially nice since we were coming from the States and arrived in Paris in the morning.  We would definitely stay here again!

L'amie d'Aline m'a bien acceuilli et m'a expliqué tout dans les moindres détails. L'appartement était propre et très complet à mon arrivée. La communication était très bonne. Vraiment rien à dire sur l'hote et l'appartement. Le seul point noir est l'emplacement. Le quartier n'inspire pas trop la sécurité. Je n'ai personnellement pas été agressé mais je n'osais pas trop sortir la nuit. Peut etre que je devais tenter

2584265,22181688,2014-11-01,6080295,Marieke,Raphaelle & Dominique's flat was absolutely perfect for our stay in Paris. It is in a fabulous location and an ideal base for exploring the city. The flat was immaculately clean and Dominique was extremely welcoming. She had left us some food for breakfast which was most kind. Unless you have difficulty with stairs (the flat is a long way up a very narrow staircase) I would highly recommend staying here.

She met me at check in and explained everything also advised on good places to go in the area. She was very respectful and trusted me with her flat entirely which is always very important as an Airbnb Guest. 
The flat is an amazing location in the heart of the 11th and even though it is on a busy street it is very quiet as it is in the courtyard. I spent a week there during the heatwave and Aurelie's flat was surprisingly pleasant even without the Aircon. Very comfy and cosy place with a superb bed had the best sleeps! I would definitely recommend it if you are work work/holiday in Paris."

20421901,219634288,2017-12-18,69433865,Megan,One of the best AirBnB locations we have ever stayed in. The location in Le Marais (4th Arr.) gives you the best Paris has to offer. The bed was comfortable. The extra amenities were very appreciated since we traveled from Canada. The shower was hot and amazing! Sun is an exceptional host that goes above and beyond. We hope to be back soon!

12612812,478022183,2019-06-29,22168907,Ashley,For this listing you are staying in someone’s apartment while they are away— so expect that that person’s belongings will be in the apartment. The apartment wasn’t particularly clean. If you are short on options this is a decent place to stay. If you’re not short on options try someplace else.
4062031,196956800,2017-09-24,17808188,Angeles,Great place to stay. Abye was so kind to gift us bus tickets for our first ride in Paris! We strongly recommend the apartment as it will make you feel at home.

500580,7778157,2013-10-02,4999060,Brankica,Great location close to metro station (2 of them). Very lively neighborhood with lot of cafes and restaurants in the square in front of house. Since apartment is in the yard behind the building  there is no noise in the apartment and it's quiet for sleeping. Bad things is that other room (and bed for sleeping) is in the basement with lot of humidity. And apartment is not for 4 persons cause bed in the upper room is too small for 2 persons.
9244179,266025587,2018-05-19,3891525,Robert,To find security and easy access was first rate. This is not a Hotel.  Not meant to be. You walk into Alex’s personality. He treat his guests with respect and therefore it is easy to be reciprocal. Reccommended
7220349,490138908,2019-07-18,84283142,Alisa,Very clean and comfortable apartment in a classic Parisian apartment building. The host is quick to respond to questions and very accommodating!

The apartment is lovely and I would definitely stay here again as the location is also great! Also I loved all the cute details in their apartment.
11693653,475917635,2019-06-25,247967590,Annie,"Set on a cool neighbourhood there are a variety of local ethnic and French restaurants. Several small grocery stores and a few fresh ingredients markets. 
The apartment is a very short walk to the metro and you can be at most tourist designations within less than 20 minutes. By day 3 we had the Metro routes pretty much sorted. 
The apartment is ‘cool’ and the host is clearly an art lover and very chic the apartment feels genuine and homely but not pretentious. It had everything we needed for our stay and as part of my daughter’s 21st birthday I made eggs benedict and chocolate covered strawberries which I couldn’t have pulled off in a hotel. 
Fabienne our host was out of the city when we arrived but her daughter met us and showed us around the apartment and made us feel comfortable. 
We were supposed to be a party of 4 one couple and two singles but sadly my friend had a family emergency and couldn’t come BUT.... if she had come there was ample room for us to have two singles and a double with an extra single in the living room. 
I’d you are a FUSSY traveller then stay somewhere else that is not because there is anything wrong with this apartment at all the apartment is ideal for tourists who want a genuine feel of the city they are in not those who are looking to complain about anything that isn’t the same as ‘back home’ 
We had 5 nights 6 days ( 2 of them sick with cold which also was a plus not to be in a hotel) and the experience was great. I felt like I had a window on French life and my daughter the art student studied all the pieces in the house. 
Fabienne is one cool lady and we got to meet her for 5 minutes as we were leaving and thank her for our stay. I hope to return with my friend who missed the trip due to family issues and would definitely stay here again. 
Merci Beaucoup Fabienne"

18224706,555880097,2019-10-28,52970256,Bayard,Marie's place is fantastic. Located 5 minutes from the metro surrounded by some great local boulangeries and very private and secure. Marie is very communicative and gave clear instructions for check-in before I arrived. The photos are highly accurate -- if anything they don't do the place justice. Sparkling clean fantastic shower and comfy bed. Lots of natural light and very quiet. While we didn't have a chance to cook the kitchen was well-equipped for any aspiring chef!

534650,306766897,2018-08-13,1892873,Matthew,Gilian’s place is a stand-alone apartment in the courtyard of a building. It’s an adorable little hideaway and a cozy respite from the bustle of the city!
24346810,266467989,2018-05-20,185419365,Helmut,Clean efficiency room with small kitchen and very close to the metro station.   You need to walk up 5 floors so keep that in mind.  You will also need codes to get into the building that Marina will give you.  This place provided great value for a wonderful stay in Paris.

7041567,43083414,2015-08-17,37467135,Hendrik,Die Lage des Apartments bietet einen optimalen Startpunkt für die Erkundung der Millionenstadt. Im direkten Umfeld sind Bars und Restaurants für jeden Geschmack zu finden. Die Anbindung an das öffentliche Nahverkehrsnetz ist durch eine nahe gelegene Metro Station ideal. Das Apartement selbst ist durch die hier zu sehenden Bilder sehr gut beschrieben und es gab keine Überraschungen. Besonders angenehm ist der direkte Zugang zur Terrasse. Während unseres Aufenthaltes stand immer jemand telefonisch für Rückfragen bereit was wir aber nicht beanspruchen mussten.

17167778,338259561,2018-10-19,187144585,Helge,"I like the flat very much and I like the area too. 

If you like some streching and easy exercise for free: Every morning at 9 you can join a qi gong class in the park Buttes Chaumont near Rue Botzaris and the Café Rosa Bonheur. The park is  good for a walk and I also walked in the small streets of the nice area Mouzaïa nearby."
25062404,489677185,2019-07-17,232078578,Mario,The apartment was bigger than you’d expect for a big city like a Paris. A lot of windows that allowed sunlight in and easy to get to once you figure it out. Plenty of space for our family of four.  As great as the apartment was the location was the best part.  Near St. Michel there are plenty of restaurants nearby a short walk to a metro stop the Norte Dame is 5 minutes away on foot and the Louvre is maybe a 15 minute walk. We will definitely look into staying here again when we go back to Paris.
6547059,53342518,2015-11-08,5329765,Elise,"Eva was a great host she was really accommodating with our arrival and departure times and made she we had everything we needed and more. She was very friendly and made it easy to organise our trip.
The studio was really lovely and very clean. It was newly refurbished comfortable and spacious.
The location is excellent and we were able to walk to most places we wanted to visit. Although it's on a busy street of bars and restaurants the flat is in a very peaceful courtyard very silent and calm.
I would recommend this pied a terre for anyone visiting Paris!

21881319,317620686,2018-09-02,127831955,Anne,Very nice place not the most clean but surely fine great location. Only a disturbing issue with the key to the parking space. The key had been lost even with previous renters and we had to wait for an hour and address neighbours to be able to actually leave the parking space. No help offered when I called Luckeys they just said we had to wait for neighbours. Not very professional or committed to helping us.

2643308,53083877,2015-11-04,27782042,Dmitry,Маленькая уютная квартира для двух человек недавно отремонтированная интересно оформленная удачно расположена на первом этаже  пятиэтажного дома в двух минутах ходьбы от метро Lamark. Оборудована всем необходимым для комфортного пребывания. Расположена в тихом районе в двух минутах ходьбы большой универсам в соседнем доме булочная со свежей выпечкой. К минусам можно отнести  слабую звукоизоляцию  (слышно соседей сверху а также всех проходящих по лестнице в парадной). Особенностью квартиры является то что двуспальная кровать расположена в лофте добраться в который можно только по приставной лестнице что не составит проблем для молодых и бодрых но может стать затруднительным для людей старшего возраста или маленьких детей. Хозяин очень приветливый и приятный человек. Мы бы с удовольствием остановились в этой квартире в следующую поездку.

12803376,165596075,2017-07-01,107474422,Bonnie,Stephane's apartment was very clean and tidy. It was also very bright  spacious  and was within a short walking distance to grocery stores/bus and metros. Stephane was a really good host was very helpful. Retrieving the keys was simple  his instructions were very clear . He also provided my mom and I with a bunch of resources such as maps and bus routes for the city which definitely came in handy. Overall I had a great Airbnb experience here . I would highly recommend this place ! 
29388849,481201888,2019-07-04,32814183,Alice,Agathe’s home is what Air BNB is at its best. A genuine home tastefully decorated and thoughtfully presented. It’s a sanctuary in a very cool part of Paris and I would highly recommend stepping out beyond the tight confines of the centre to experience what Parisian life is all about for most people. Absolutely one of the best Air BNB experiences I have had.

The very important for us downside was the neighborhood. The street is busy with several restaurants and bars right below the windows. No air conditioning. So we had to open the windows but the noise from the street stops late in the night and begins very early in the morning. We actually could not sleep."

26151927,164618144,2017-06-28,34753510,Nicole,GREAT hostel! Typically not a fan of the hostel set-up but this place was modern and clean and we had OUR OWN BATHROOM! Rooms are New York-style small but very comfortable. We saw all ages in there from a child to an older adult. The common area was like a small enjoyable cafe. Nice. Definitely recommend
10793248,284734284,2018-07-02,143297477,Thomas,I stayed here for 4 months during my internship in Paris! The studio was spacious compared to many others in Paris and was spotless on arrival. The bed is extremely comfortable and spacious (definitely big enough for 2 people) and the host provided all the necessary amenities and was always on hand to offer any assistance or replace any items such as lightbulbs the toaster etc. The studio has some nice modern touches such as the kitchen as well as some more traditional features. The toilet is located just outside the flat but this is often the case in Paris - I certainly didn't find this a problem during my 4 month stay. Finally the location was perfect - 1 minute walk to the metro station and Javel RER which made it perfect for travelling around Paris and beyond. I would recommend this studio to anyone who is looking for a good value studio in a fantastic peaceful residential area of Paris. Thanks so much Sylvia for making my stay so enjoyable!

6461738,280839589,2018-06-24,160011267,Nicole,"Marina's apartment is a truly magical space. Every morning we had to pinch ourselves when we opened the windows to make sure we weren't still dreaming. 

The view in every direction is spectacular (better than from the Sacré-coeur!). The beds were extremely comfortable & our children were very happy sharing the huge sofa bed. 

The apartment is beautifully decorated very clean and we had everything we needed. It was just outside the main tourist throng of the Sacré-coeur but 2-3 minutes from the metro beautiful food shops & fabulous restaurants. Everyday we gathered the most delicious ingredients from the street below for our picnics and meals in the apartment.

Sebastian was there to meet us when we arrived and was very welcoming and helpful. We could not have had a lovelier week in Paris."

Apartment is real Parisian treasure. Nicely renovated clean and light. 4th floor but stairs are quite large so we didn't have any problems with our bags. 
The location as well cool - just around the corner from the Main Street ( so its quite) but next to little streets with bars restaurants.  Few min walk from Louvre or Pompidou museums Brand new Halle. 
I definitely will contact Caroline for my next stay and I highly recommend apartment to everyone!

33011428,490895000,2019-07-19,8607543,Olga,Overall i had a pleasant stay in Anne-Marie's apartment. An apartment is as spacious and cozy as pictured and has everything one's might need for a long comfortable stay. Location is great the neighborhood might seem rough at first glance but it's actually one of the most hip and cultural neighborhoods in the city with a lot of nice bars restorants galleries and hidden venues just avoid main streets. Also two great parks Belleville and  Buttes-Chaumont are in the walking distance from the apartment. I had some minor problems on the arrival and getting a key from the appartment because Anne-Marie changed a plan an hour before my arrival and sent me a message about it on AirBnb website and ufortunately i didn't notice it. Also an apartment was very dusty on the arrival and i had to clean it myself but Anne-Marie offered me to sent a cleaning agent next day and make a cleaning fee refund so this issue been resolved. Overall i would recomend this apartment for a long stay i hope that Anne-Marie will consider my complains for make further guests stay even more comfortable. Also i'm not the fan of Hostnfly service  it's always nicer to deal with the host directly.

14707133,241244235,2018-03-08,99145095,Agustina,"Joly nos recibió muy atento aunque al momento de encontrarnos para que nos dé las llaves falló un poco la comunicación ya que al nosotras ser del extranjero y no tener chip en el país tuvimos que activar el roaming. Katherine demoró mucho en las respuestas a nuestras dudas por mail y no teníamos número de contacto de ella sólo el de Joly.
La ubicación excelente y el departamento tal cual a la foto aunque le faltaban utensilios esenciales y un poco más de limpieza."
5859453,37301646,2015-07-06,31230763,Vandana,Thanks for being a great host! Yaya was really helpful pre-arrival and very responsive and flexible which was very much appreciated. Its definitely cosy but was the perfect base for just a couple of days in the city. The apartment modern and is in an amazing location - so close to many amenities bars and restaurants as well as some of the main sites in Paris. Thank you!

5290064,80336871,2016-06-17,69718113,Jorge,I highly recommend to stay with Maguy... She's an awesome host and very nice and kind person. The Maguy's breakfast is the best and if you like cats...

947007,539623878,2019-10-01,1711736,Barbra,Marie has great communication and her apartment was easy to find thanks to her clear directions. The bedroom is large and comfortable - exactly as shown in the photos. It faces an interior courtyard which is very quiet. The bedroom is down a long hallway affording quiet and privacy. However you need to cross Marie’s private living area to reach the shared bathroom. There is no kitchen access but there are lots of trendy restaurants and bakeries nearby. Marie’s place offers great value for such a good location in Paris.
61459,15174578,2014-07-04,13196362,Scott,"Location is great - easy to access best Metro lines at Etoile but not a touristy area. Walk to supermarket bakery restaurants. 

Apartment was clean very quiet and secure. Everything worked well. Wifi is superfast!

Stéphanie was very pleasant and helpful. 

I stayed there for six days with my niece. Very pleasant and relaxing experience. We would stay there again."

( payantes mais à paris c le cas partout).les nuits sont très calmes dans la rue .Lorsque nous reviendrons passer un week end en famille sur paris c’est sans hésiter dans l’appartement de Mathieu que nous essaierons de réserver 
24899575,457022716,2019-05-23,10104759,Charles,Didn't spend much time there but Alexis was great! Fantastic location
159077,478359,2011-08-27,739831,Paloma,"Noemie is very friendly and helpful. I have been for 40 days in her apartment and during those days she was traveling but she continues to provide assistance to any thing I needed! The apartment is amazing clear cozy and quiet overlooking a beautiful garden! The street is very busy with many Chinese restaurants around where you can eat well and cheap! And it's two steps to the subway station it means a few minutes of the sights of the city. The shower is very good hard to find in most Parisian apartments. The internet works very well after all I had no problems during my stay! Everything was perfect! I highly recommend it!
Thank you Noemie!"
21389133,361282369,2018-12-23,5269653,Fabien,The video at this place is amazing. but this didn't stop Julien and Caroline to provide also a great appartement comfortable and clean.

38473770,547502718,2019-10-15,243713539,Ana,A casa estava suja comida aberta no frigorífico e lençóis sujos falámos com o Fabi no sentido de arranjar uma solução que passaria pela troca dos lençóis disse que não tinha tido tempo para limpar o apartamento porque estaria a estudar dado absolutamente irrelevante quando se trata de uma reserva com duas semanas! Mandou-nos ir à lavandaria lavar os lençóis. Segundo anuncio do apartamento existe um ferro de engomar e um secador de cabelo sendo um anúncio enganador pois não havia nada. Enviei mensagem ao Fabi - como poderá ser comprovado com a troca de email - mais uma vez para saber onde se encontravam sem nunca obter uma resposta. Lamentavelmente a nossa experiência em Paris foi completamente arruinada por este apartamento pagámos por um apartamento sem as mínimas condições de higiene e conforto.
5650752,141499309,2017-04-03,106413855,Keyisha,Wonderful place to stay close to many scenic sites. Walking distance to Eiffel Tour.

6456295,267926966,2018-05-23,1648967,Valter,"Mathilde's place was perfect! 
She was super attentive during the check-in and made sure we were all set. The apartment is perfect for 2 people we were at the end of our trip and needed to do laundry the machine worked great!! 
The apartment is close to many shops restaurants and bars. Aux deux amis is amazing. Easy to walk to Canal St Martin and Bastille. They said Oberkampf neighborhood can be loud but the apartment was super quiet and great to sleep."
7948509,319042025,2018-09-05,41811222,Richard R.,Clean and well-appointed apartment looking out over the rooftops of Paris. I particularly appreciated the host Isabelle’s patience and precise responses given that I was on the go in airports and train stations with patchy internet access. I requested to check in early because I was weighed down with luggage and Isabelle was very accommodating. The bistrot opposite recommended by the host is the real deal - I’ve moved into my own place in a different neighbourhood of Paris but find myself tempted to take the metro just to return for the œufs mayo rillettes maison etc.
3320447,38810262,2015-07-19,11408161,Agnete,We had a very nice stay in  Cloe's appartment. It is very cosy and it is easy to get to the metro ( and to the top of Montmartre) 
4108069,111488285,2016-10-31,41703407,Marina,Jonathan is a very friendly and welcoming host. Although I was running a bit late he waited for the handover of the keys and even took the time to explain how things in the flat work. The flat has its right size as well as the bed. It is very tranquil. You would need to climb 6 floors to get up - but seriously i did not mind I think it is quite rewarding once you are in the flat (and had all this Parisian food...). The area is wonderful - a petit village friendly and safe neighbourhood with lots of organic shops and authentic brasseries. 
20203830,358128988,2018-12-13,2962009,Aurélien,Accueil attentionné appartement calme et très bien situé disponible à distance tout au long du séjour.
8442497,254315761,2018-04-16,157182622,Gonzalo,Excelente anfitriona siempre muy pendiente de que todo estuviera bien. Ingresamos de forma muy fácil tal cual nos explicó. El apartamento es espectacular en todos sus ambientes. Es amplio y muy cuidado. La cocina es excelente y tiene todo lo que se necesita. La ubicación es excelente y la zona bastante tranquila. Se encuentran varios supermercados en la zona asi como también restaurantes y panaderías. A pocas cuadras se llega a orillas del Sena donde se puede llegar simplemente caminando a diferentes puntos de interés. Sin duda volvería a hospedarme en este lugar cuando vuelva a París.
13536456,184207374,2017-08-19,87486566,Constanza,Hermoso departamento amplio luminoso y cómodo para dos personas. La zona es ideal llena de bares restaurantes y cafés. Podés moverte a pie sin problema y sino hay tres líneas de subte a 5 cuadras. No tuvimos el gusto de haber conocido a Carlos pero estuvo siempre disponible para cualquier consulta. Muchas gracias nuevamente! Tuvimos una estadía impecable en Paris.
550225,166977194,2017-07-05,21711404,Stephany,Edouard's place is exactly what you see in the photos. The sofa folds out into a bed so it's the perfect size for couples who are traveling. It's a 7-10 minute walk to the Notre Dame and the nightlife in the area is alive till 1 am (even on the weekdays). There's a ton of great places right outside the apartment for late night snacks. The Nutella crepe cart on the cross street of the apartment is delish. I highly recommend this place if you're looking to be out at night.
26616067,331641667,2018-10-03,73870846,Sveta,Hi. This flat is really cool comfortable everything you need is there. Photos correspond to reality and even better. Thank you very much for meeting us late in the evening. The location is great metro is really two steps away it was super.

5718695,46822929,2015-09-13,31335230,Jin,It was really cute house. There is no elevator so it's little hard. But the location is good.
22022773,260822718,2018-05-05,162824896,Bev,This cute little hotel located close to Rue Martyr has helpful desk clerks an amazing offering of afternoon treats and a bountiful breakfast.  They really go out of their way to give you all the extras weary travelers need including clean rooms and a comfortable lobby area.  Loved the location and would stay there again.
23097057,252085341,2018-04-09,97743922,Claudio Jorge,"I was on Manon's apartment with my wife and kid. It was enough spacious for a couple and a child. 
The apartment was very cozy very well located next to a square with lots of restaurants bars bakeries etc. It's also close to a metro station from where you can get basically everywhere in Pais. 
Was very easy to communicate with Manon and she was very flexible with the ckeck in / check out. It was a great experience for sure to repeat."
20929062,346584754,2018-11-09,200466879,Diego,Great place very comfortable and great location. Very well equipped. Ideal for our kids and us. The subway station is just one block away. There is a very nice grocery store next to the apartment. I would recommend it.
34269454,512241794,2019-08-18,37167729,Stephanie,"Super Mini-Appartement für bis zu 4 Personen mit allem was man braucht. Sehr einladend sicher & guter Style wir haben uns gleich wir zu Hause gefühlt. Vor allem die Lage in der Stadt ist super und die Aussicht vom 5. Stock mit Sicht auf den Eiffelturm. Einfach grandios! Perfekt um mit dem Fahrrad das man im verschlossenen Hof einstellen kann die Stadt zu erkunden. Geschäfte Cafés & Restos für jeden Geschmack ums Eck. Was will man mehr?
Danke dir Georges für die tolle. Tage in Paris!"

27616786,476519045,2019-06-26,198006262,Mariah,"We had a very nice stay in Paris. The pictures do not do the view justice it is specular. Also the room is bigger than it seems in the pictures. 
Overall a great location and clean apartment would recommend!"

Christophe was a great host! The flat is nice and clean and we had everything we needed. We highly recommend this place!
122179,251170147,2018-04-07,132821591,Jill,A perfect space fo either a couple or with one young child. Location couldn’t be easier with access to local restaurants and the metro to anywhere.  It has all the emeritus of a fully equipped home. Amazing
24108083,429926131,2019-03-29,115582184,Ruth,Christina’s place is on an excellent location.  Rather small but it was ok for us cause we didn’t cook and just stayed to sleep.  We walked to the Louvre even walked to the Eiffel Tower that was a longer walk but doable then took an Uber back for reasonable $amount.  We also walked to take the big red bus Paris.  Highly recommend if you don’t mind a small space.  It was perfect for us.
17231407,403967442,2019-01-22,3234548,Gabriela,Great location!! My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Matias’ place. Luz was great at communicating at check in and check out. Would definitely book again.
132533,60453387,2016-01-24,46794795,Nadia,"Le quartier est très bien situé avec des boulangeries épiceries et autres commerces à proximité. L'immeuble est très calme et ses habitants très aimables.
Léa est une personne charmante et très prévoyante ainsi que son ami d'ailleurs.
Le studio est charmant quoique un peu trop juste pour deux personnes.L'eau chaude est suffisante pour la journée et pour deux personnes les serviettes et draps sont propres et le lit assez confortable.
Les peintures du mur noir et des sanitaires ont besoin d'être rafraîchiessinon le reste est assez fidèle aux photos.
Si vous êtes souvent dehors ce studio pourrait très bien vous convenir car il est bien situé propre et très calme."

Alexa was very welcoming and the communication was perfect. She even met me at Gare du Nord to give me the keys to the apartment."
11173603,417421196,2019-02-27,30771470,Cris,It s a very cozy place to a group stay in a very practical location
1539224,9536353,2014-01-02,7716674,Natalie,I had a wonderful time at this apartment. Although small its perfect for 2 people! My fiancé and myself had the feeling of living in Paris for our visit. The kitchen has everything you need (besides a kettle but we improvised) the bed is comfortable there is hot water in the shower at all times a nice balcony to open for fresh air and fast internet. I would recommend anyone to stay here as it is great and close to a metro which got us all around paris in a matter of minutes. If you have bags be prepared for the stairs but this was not a big problem at all. Its also near to grocery stores and restaurants which is a plus! Whenever I am in Paris again this will be my home again!
20124171,329238601,2018-09-28,34058013,Julio & Lissette,Great location and very stylish apartment. Wonderful host. Highly recommended.

15673558,218657730,2017-12-14,86499101,Bridgette,Maikel's place was great for our stay in Paris!  Convenient location for both walking around the city or taking public transit.  The apartment was lovely with a spiral staircase and although it was a one bedroom the loft had an additional bed creating a more spacious feeling.
2144036,241426338,2018-03-09,32790569,Valérie,Très bon rapport qualité prix à l’exception de la cuisine qui est vraiment très petite. Sinon tout le reste était bien et le contact facile.
3473556,49419087,2015-10-04,30491317,Anne,"This comfortable little apartment was just perfect for our visit to Paris. It was so close to so many things we wanted to see and the Metro was close for everything else.  The bed was just heaven to sleep on.  Michael and Sylvie provided great information for shops close by and we had everything we needed in the apartment. We loved that the window could be left open with a flow of fresh air coming in.  
The only thing we were not made aware of was that the apartment was at the top of a 5 flight walk up spiral steps.  Sure was hard to get the suitcases up and down those steps.
Other than that it was a great location and a great experience.
Thanks
Anne"
2725795,17746589,2014-08-17,15271467,Thierry,L'appartement situé au coeur d'un quartier où nous avions vécu quelques années plus tôt nous a rappelé nos meilleurs souvenirs. La visite du cimetière du Père Lachaise situé à quelques mètres et des quartiers populaires de Belleville à également fait partie des moments forts de notre visite. 
1352028,292055675,2018-07-17,112528848,Alejandro,"ESP: El apartamento de Celine estuvo muy bien. La ubicación es muy buena una zona tranquila sin ruidos con parada de metro cercana bares y supermercados cercanos también. Además la anfitriona Celine nos recibió con perfecta puntualidad y en el piso nos dejó aceite especias etc lo cual ayuda mucho a la hora de evitar comprar más de lo necesario. Sin duda contaba con todo lo necesario y lo recomendaría a futuros huéspedes.

ENG: Celine's apartment was very good. The location is very good a quiet area no noise with nearby metro station bars and supermarkets nearby. In addition the hostess Celine received us with perfect punctuality and in the apartment she left us oil spices etc. which helps a lot in avoiding buying more than necessary. Without a doubt the apartment had everything necessary and I would recommend it to future guests."
6374463,224735107,2018-01-04,141912700,Kirsten,We have loved staying in this apartment in Passy. It is clean spacious and quiet. It is very safe and secure. The surrounding local artisan markets are wonderful for buying local produce. The metro is easy to use and the Eiffel Tower is only a 10 minute walk away. We look forward to returning. 
16168650,505386961,2019-08-09,162915515,Kim,The house is clear and well equipped. The bed is soft. But there is no window and it’s on the first floor. The host is nice. When we arrived We thought the door was stuck and could not open (actually we just need to push harder) and the host immediately reply to solve the problem. And we suggest the host to change the check out time on main page from 1pm to 12pm if he want.
8064644,366278712,2019-01-02,233104039,Frederic,Un appartement décoré avec gout et très propre . Très bien situé près d'une ligne de métro.  David est super réactif et sympa . A recommander

1050099,269962729,2018-05-28,188014701,Deyan,We liked the little bakeries/restaurants that we’re close-byand the fact that there are storespharmacies and a metro/tube and that further brings security and calmness during the stay.
2402749,79830988,2016-06-14,8332664,Larry,"I have stayed in many Airbnb's but the help and assistance from Aurélie and her son who welcomed us was the best I have received.
As I was travelling with my 86 year old father I needed to check lots of details and no matter what Aurélie came back with answers to my endless questions. The apartment is homely clean and very comfortable. In terms of location it is perfect for getting to see the best of Paris close to 2 x metro's with plentiful supply of uber's also.

16628696,494876461,2019-07-25,112401314,Sabrina,Valentin was quick to respond to our messages. Although he wasn’t available to greet us his friend Alain was and he was friendly and spoke Spanish (not English) which thankfully we were able to communicate with each other. Apartment is just as described clean modern and close to metro and trams. Unfortunately we traveled during the hottest days in Paris this summer so only thing we would have liked was AC units in the flat. Valentin did provide us with cooling fans which helped. Also I forgot a piece of jewelry and he’s been actively responding and plans to return it to me back in USA.
19407334,301481093,2018-08-04,4340062,Bjarke,Small but very fine apartment! There’s space to cook something or you can find restaurants/cafes in the area. It’s easy to reach many tourist attractions with the Metro lines nearby also RER C is close going directly to Versailles. My girlfriend and me enjoyed our stay.

350571,30882974,2015-04-28,30176398,Ben,"As soon as Lucile communicated that I would be staying at her apartment she was wonderfully helpful from day one. Knowing that I would be early than usual on arrival she was kind enough to organise for her daughter to be in St Germain des-Pres to meet and show me through the room ensuring I was set for my 3 days in Paris.

Lucile also provided a full guide on how to reach the location via various means along with a great little rough guide to the area - shops amenities restaurants and things to do.

The apartment itself was exactly what I was chasing a great little place in the heart of Paris. Great food at your doorstep and only minutes in all directions to main attractions if that is your desire or if like me close to 'the real Paris' if that is to your liking.

Very easy stay and would use again. Thanks Lucile!"

16420403,536798851,2019-09-27,159632830,Kathy,This a fantastic place for a longer term Parisian vacation. We were there three weeks so we used our Metro passes to go anywhere while having the advantages of a little less expensive place and of staying in a typical Parisian neighborhood. There are wonderful restaurants and cafes nearby a three story grocery store a boulangerie several cheese shops fruit stands. It was great!  The Metro stop is around the corner. The apartment has a separate bedroom from the living area and a really nice bathroom. It’s located in a courtyard so the view is beautiful trees quietness and a nice breeze when the windows are open.

A stylish green space we found the bed super comfortable! the self check-in was convenient too and response times were very quick. All in all a great experience!
33549243,544983899,2019-10-11,17268413,David,This apartment is quite small—the kind of place you mostly use to sleep and keep your things—but the location is ideal. There may be no better spot in the city for food drink and nightlife (though the apartment was quiet late at night luckily) and all the major tourist spots are easily accessible from here. Check-in is quick and easy and Ari is a super responsive host.

10002623,71531577,2016-04-26,66777085,Sebastian,Sebastien was a perfect host. He told us everything which could be useful. His apartment was cosy comfortable and clean. The apartment is very well located - there are two shops and boulangeries nearby. There is also metro station 5 minutes walk. It was an amazing base for couple of friends in Paris.
2073167,79223722,2016-06-12,71583749,Da Hyung,I highly recommend this lodging. Not to mention its central location the apartment is so well maintained that one has the impression of being in a hotel room. Accomodation is provided for late check-in via a mailbox that is very easy to use and conveniently near the apartment. There are many beautiful restaurants in the area along with nice cafés and brunch places that all enhanced the quality of our stay at André's place. 
21247756,498822083,2019-07-30,35725892,Audrey,Je confirme les commentaires déjà publiés sur cette adresse : l'appartement est très bien situé proche de tous commerces métro canal parc ; très propre et accueillant avec tout le nécessaire pour se sentir chez soi.

Location was fantastic very safe with lots of lovely bars in the area.
Had a wonderful time and would love to come back. Thank you so much!"
3335366,279008154,2018-06-19,166648140,Andrea,The apartment was comfortable and luxurious with many original artworks that we admired. The windows opened on a lively street scene and provided a great view of the three-days-a-week market. The metro an excellent cheese shop patisserie boulangerie and wine shop were only steps from the door.  We can’t imagine a better place for visiting the sites of Paris. Our hosts were nearby and ready to supply any information that we might need. Thank you Isabelle and Hervé!
2931053,276908018,2018-06-15,29366686,Sami,"The metro station is one minute away. A lot of supermarkets and restaurants and shops on the same street. 
Amar was always ready to answer our questions and the apartment is well equipped and clean. 
I recommend it to other travelers. "
22579671,271696020,2018-06-02,35260095,Rick,The place was very comfortable for our group of four adults.  Spacious living area bedrooms & bathrooms.  The kitchen was well equipped with good quality appliances utensils and glassware.  The traffic noise can be heard during the day with the windows open facing the street but once closed in the evening it was very quiet inside the apartment.  The bedrooms located in the back away from the street overlooked a courtyard  but even with the windows open it was very quiet at night.  It was unseasonably warm during the week that we stayed so we had to sleep with the windows open as there is no air condition in the apartment.  However we were quite comfortable just the same with the windows open.  Lots of lovely restaurants & bars just steps from the apartment on the same street.  Best of all the apartment was conveniently located just steps across the street to the river where we walked along side  to many sites & attractions including Norte Dame Sainte-Chapelle bistros shopping and fine restaurants as well as metro stations.  This apartment was perfectly suited and made our Paris experience that much more enjoyable.  Finally thank you Tania for being a great host and especially for your efforts to accommodate our early arrival.  We appreciate your very welcome attitude and look very much forward to staying at your place again the next time we visit Paris which I hope is sooner than later.

1600138,107908483,2016-10-13,21810985,Chip,This is the third Peniche we've rented in Paris and was an excellent experience and value. Everything in the listing was completely accurate and we had a wonderful stay. The location is fantastic with access to several large metro stations and walking distance to The Bastille. If you rent this Peniche I also recommend dinner arrangements at A la Biche Au Bois just across the Seine for the full Paris experience.
24155895,339336710,2018-10-21,96702016,Katarzyna,"We enjoyed our stay at Manon’s apartment a lot. Our host was very helpful and was easy to contact with.
The apartment is in quiet neighborhood with grocerys and bakery very close to the metro what in my opinion is the most importent when you have plan to visit Paris :) 
We are very satisfied  
Thank you Manon :)"
6026738,267682267,2018-05-22,179785031,Elisabetta,Ottima posizione geografica. Ben collegata con mezzi di trasporto pubblici e in zona ricca  di locali e ristoranti di ogni tipo. Soddisfatti della disponibilità e flessibilità dell’host. L’appartamento è molto spazioso tuttavia dispone di un unico wc ed ha la necessità di un restauro generale e di evidenti migliorie. Queste caratteristiche lo rendono più adatto a gruppi di giovani ospiti piuttosto che a famiglie.

1829965,25377994,2015-01-14,9958797,Saul,Genevieve was helpful and very accommodating of a minor change we needed to make to our booking. Some have complained about the Internet but we found it to be very good. The location was excellent and the apartment had everything we needed.  The flat was very small but that is normal for Paris. The only item for improvement was that it could have been cleaner. We spent some time cleaning walls and the bathroom but apart from this we had a lovely time here.

15716842,456766411,2019-05-22,123433568,Molly,This apartment is in a great location in Montmartre. We enjoyed our stay here and found the place comfortable. I would point out as a couple other reviews have that the tub/shower is quite small and partially raised - not an issue for us as we are able bodied but just a note to anyone travelling who has limited mobility the shower would be difficult. Otherwise a great space.
2267326,133376154,2017-02-22,9781223,Mirjana,"It is a small charmy studio in a nice area quiet and clean. 
It is on the top floor with no lift which I didn't mind good exercise but could be difficult if You are not fit or have lot of to carry with..
The little thing I mind is that the toillet is outside of the Apt but clean. 
Very parisian inspiring location!
Honorine is a very nice person responsive and careful for her guestsand I really appreciate she allowed me to check out later on my last day.
Merci Honorine!"

Restaurants cafes and a supermarket are only metres away as is the metro. The perfect location for us to visit all the cultural treasures Paris has to offer and the apartment was perfect for our kids.
8808811,100545842,2016-09-09,50071822,Tania,The apartment is super well located lots of restaurants near by and transportation (bus train taxis) super close too.

1398522,106828891,2016-10-08,25083890,Carla,O apartamento é exatamente como descrito. O banheiro fica apertado devido a maquina de lavar roupa que lá se encontra. A localização compensa tudo bem na esquinaa poucos passos fica a estação de metrô Duroc na esquina do boulevard Montparnasse.  A pé se chegar a Gare Montparnasse facilitando aos que vão fazer alguma viagem de trem. Ao lado da entrada do  prédio tem um pequeno supermercado além de boulangeries restaurantes e lojas diversas na mesma rua.  É muito silencioso pois fica de fundos. Ideal para um casal. Fomos recebido muito bem por um rapaz muito gentil que nos mostrou o apartamento. 
4020948,37093247,2015-07-04,1748854,Celine,Brice is a fantastic host - friendly and very thoughtful. We arrived in the middle of the heatwave in Paris and Brice bought a fan for us to use as the loft can get very stuffy in the summer. He was very helpful - giving us directions as to the cool places in the neighbourhood paying for our car's parking up front and offering to take us around the neighbourhood to get our errands done. The apartment is as seen in the photos with a good collection of music that Brice the musician gave us access to (and he has good taste in music). Rent this if you'd like a glimpse of the artist life in Paris. (Note: it's on the second floor and has no lift).

17838931,424234635,2019-03-16,96970011,Monica,Loved our stay at this cute little place. We were catching a late train to Paris and didn’t have a place to stay. We found Dod and Nastia’s place and they accepted our request so quickly. Their response time was so helpful and their flexibility with check in and check out. The apartment is located in a perfect location so you can easily Uber around to anything. You can walk to several places to eat or shop.  Dod is so sweet he explained all of the amenities in detail offered to answer any questions and even drew things on a map for us. The stay was comfortable and made things truly effortless on our short trip. Would 10/10 stay again.

9825542,143290408,2017-04-11,14687205,Guido,"Wir waren für zwei Nächste in der kleinen süßen Wohnung von Maximilienne. Ihr Sohn hat auf unsere Ankunft gewartet uns nett begrüßt. Der Kontakt und die Infos im Vorfeld waren sehr nett und alles hat gut geklappt. Wir wollten auf unserer Reise (2 Erwachsene 2 Kinder und Hund)  nach Südfrankreich für einen Tag Paris anschauen. Dafür ist die Wohnung toll gelegen. Bus und Metro Einkaufen und Cafes und Restaurants sind in 2 Minuten zu erreichen. Mit der Metro ist man schnell an allen Highlights.

Die Wohnung ist gut ausgestattet. Für einen längere Aufenthalt in Paris wäre es aber nichts für uns gewesen. Die Wohnung liegt im Erdgeschoss und die beiden Schlafräume mit kleiner Wendeltreppe zu erreichen im Keller ohne Fenster. Zudem ist der Keller recht feucht. Wie wir fanden. Also vielleicht nicht für jeden etwas. Die Kinder fanden es ok. Wir haben zu zweit auf dem bequemen Sofa im Erdgeschoss geschlafen. Das war für uns ok und bequem.

Alles in allem war es für uns ein schöner Aufenthalt wenn auch die Kellerschlafräume nicht unser Ding waren. Aber für einen Tag Paris ist es wirklich super gelegen."

16317805,147491901,2017-04-27,47887525,Brad,"As said in previous reciews the apartment and bathroom are tiny. It was hard to comfortably use the toilet and we found ourselves unable to comfortably walk around with a suit case on the floor. The bed is rock hard and no sleeping pillows just massive decorative pillows. We were under the assumption from the pictures and title that the eiffel tour was viewable from the street but it was about 25-30 min walk. We also didnt have hot water for showers through our entire stay. I wouldn't recommend staying here.

Wasn’t too happy about that. Basic necessities wasn’t provided ie coffee tea sugar. 9:30am electrician came knocking on the door. Other than that was a great flat to stay.. amazing shower and very clean bathrooms.
434658,83857331,2016-07-04,67297785,Pol,"Communication à travers l'agence IamB&B et remise des clés par Floriane sans aucun problème. L'appartement est très bien situé et à 1 minute de plusieurs lignes de métro et de train. Petits commerces à proximité (boulangeries supermarchés épiceries bistros ...). L'appartement nécessite pourtant être renové (meubles usés peinture absence de rideau de douche) et nettoyé à fonds (dépôt calcaire important poussière sur et en-dessous des meubles). Les càc sont situées sur le côté d'une route très fréquentée. Fenêtres mal isolées.
Conclusion: malgré les points négatifs sur la propreté et et l'état quelque peu abimé je conseillerais l'appartement surtout en raison de sa superbe situation."
19207453,216214040,2017-12-03,59633145,Joachim,Wir waren bereits das zweite Mal bei Adrian. Alles hat wieder bestens geklappt. Das ganze Appartement ist äußerst gemütlich und sehr gut durchdacht. Wir kommen gerne wieder.
16239000,147647185,2017-04-28,37853407,Zaky,Bel appartement tel que décrit dans une rue calme mais très bien desservie (métrobus). Cet appartement convient parfaitement pour un couple. Quartier plein de restaurants très animé le soir. Je garderai un bon souvenir de mon séjour cher Gauthier et le recommande.
17822307,307368621,2018-08-14,20051812,Bart And Lisa,A central location very accessible and easy walk to the metro stations. Short walking distance to 2 bakeries which is great as that means you get fresh bread every morning. The apartment is lovely and tastefully furnished. There are 2 bistros which are just next to the apartment patronised by Parisians (not tourists) and the food is fantastic especially the modern bistro. The only bugging issue about this place is it gets noisy as early as 6am as the street outside the apartment seems to be starting point for the large garbage truck. Their office opens early  which we can see directly from 1 of the bedrooms where the cleaners gather and chat with each other which was clearly audible and the garbage truck was extremely noisy. This goes on for 10-15 mins and can be annoying for people who want to sleep longer. 
24236332,452899032,2019-05-14,92731858,Anusree,"We had the most incredible time at Fatma’s place. 

If you are looking for a sparking clean space minutes away from the Eiffel Tower with a gracious host book this place immediately. 

The apartment is absolutely as advertised. The huge French windows fill the room with sunlight it’s immaculate the location has many cafes affordable restaurants minutes within reach. 

Fatma was an excellent communicator making sure my husband and I felt safe and were well taken care of. Also her place is stocked. She has lots of extra towels toilet paper cooking utensils incredible coffees teas and daily use items like olive oil balsamic vinaigrette salt pepper and dry herbs Incase you need to cook. 

I cannot recommend this place enough. Book it ASAP! Thank you Fatma. We are so grateful."

9788778,201334218,2017-10-08,117601645,Vladimir,Первое что вы увидите колоритный подъезд и лифт. Квартира уютная хоть и находится в 10 округе который считается не безопасным. Но криминала мы не увидели один из минусов района не очень чистый. Плюс квартиры находится рядом с северным вокзалом. Легко добраться из аэропорта до него и всего 10 минут пешком до квартиры. Рядом много  хороших не туристических заведений что очень радует. Квартира маленькая но для нескольких ночей в самый раз сразу проникаешься атмосферой Парижа. Еще минус под окнами находится бар и по ночам очень шумно. Общения с хозяином не было хорошо или плохо расценивайте сами. Ключ взяли из мини сейфа и после выезда положили обратно. Так же описание не соответствует действительности улица Montorgueil находится в 10 минутах ходьбы от квартиры. Общее впечатление положительное. Были некоторые бытовые недостатки о которых сообщили хозяину надеемся что их устранят.
4168129,220636215,2017-12-23,155755310,Lucie,J'ai logé 2 mois dans cet appartement. Il est super très bien placé très agrèable et bien équipé. Rien à dire.

15445103,203107495,2017-10-14,61299226,Jessica Suzanne,José was a great host. The breakfast spread was amazing and unexpected. It was like staying in a hotel but more personal and his place is in a great location.

5282606,472779888,2019-06-20,149862863,Barbara,Great location small but very well equiped.
3612662,130246088,2017-02-05,10861323,Grace,Pierre is highly welcoming. The breakfast was alright. The bed was comfy. The apartment is on the 4th floor (no lift) so be careful if you have luggage. Pierre smokes and although it is not in the communal areas my friend is asthmatic and found it a bit difficult. 
29668576,541558920,2019-10-05,149230820,Diana,Claire was an excellent host and met us in person - showed us all the amenities in the place. Super helpful and patient. Such a cute place to stay at.
35816933,484152577,2019-07-08,36563291,Irene,Javi’s place is in a great location! The neighborhood is bustling with bars and restaurants and especially comes alive on Friday and Saturday night!  The apartment is very small which is normal for Paris but it is definitely much smaller than the pictures make it seem! The big window is lovely and so is the view out of it. And then bed (which is a pullout/futon style) is really comfy!
886807,63000748,2016-02-19,56184627,Christian,"Appartement très très bien situé près de tout métro coeur de la ville. Explications simples et faciles pour s'y rendre.
Ce n'est pas Alienor qui nous a accueillit mais la personne présente était très gentille et ses explications sur le bon fonctionnement des choses concises et claires.
Seul bémol les 2 chaises de l'appart auraient avantages à être changées elles ont pas mal de vécu et ne sont plus très confortable.
À part ce détail c'était bien."
24843387,366166167,2019-01-02,155192561,Zuzana,The apartment is nicer and bigger than the photos. Camille communicates very quickly and is willing. Clean towels bedding and soap were prepared in the apartment. We were 4 young people here the apartment was enough. There is one bedroom and one living room with kitchen. The living room has a sofa that can be laid out. The foam is ready on the sofa so it's comfortable to sleep. The kitchen has all the equipment that is required with basic cooking. The location of the apartment is great because the metro to the center is about 2 minutes by foot. We traveled to the Eiffel Tower for about 50 minutes by underground. I recommend!! :-)
5483145,102808773,2016-09-19,10736163,Stefanija,The apartment's location is excellent! It is close to many restaurants bistros and galleries but also walking distance to many tourist attractions. The place was really clean and Manuel was an amazing host! Will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Paris!

26554671,365272523,2019-01-01,16165536,Louisa,Nice apartment which is located walking distance from the Moulin rouge and Sacre Coeur. We were with 4 people and the apartment is big enough for it. The bedroom on the street side is quite noisy and light though so bring earplugs. We had a great time in Paris at Valentine’s place.
703829,29832602,2015-04-13,24813909,Bjoern,"Wir kennen uns nicht in Paris aus und haben ins blaue gebucht.
Wir haben etwas gestaunt als wir dann vom Taxifahrer in klein Afrika abgesetzt wurden. Wir lieben Multi Kulti und haben uns mit der Umgebung nach kurzer Sondierung angefreundet da sie uns sehr sicher erscheint und die Menschen sehr freundlich waren.  Das Konzept der Wohnung ist super. Sie ist meist sehr ruhig wirkt hell und freundlich wie beschrieben. 
Die Wohnung hat muffig gerochen da es einen Wasserschaden gegeben hat. Das war für mich ein kleiner Abstrich so wie das Wasser in der Dusche welches erst als Rinnsal aus dem Duschkopf und dann nicht abfloss. Aber preis Leistung stimmt nach kleiner Sanierung  absolut. Michael war sehr freundlich und hat einen sehr ausführlichen professionellen Plan bereit gelegt. Den sollte man auf jeden Fall lesen. Durch Zufall haben wir ihn vor der Abreise getroffen. Ein sehr netter Mensch der freundliche Gäste verdient hat."
747874,142644866,2017-04-09,21844528,Matias,La casa de Gwénola es muy hermosa y luminosa. Los espacios son amplios y permite a una familia de 5 personas estar muy cómodos. La casa está súper equipada con todo lo necesario para vivir un tiempo sin problemas. El único inconveniente es el poco espacio para poner las cosas de uno en armarios o cajoneras ya que toda la casa está llena de objetos de la familia. Está ubicada en un barrio tranquilo y silencioso. Un poco retirada de le marais y más ubicada en la Bastille. A la vuelta hay un supermercado y lugares para comprar lo que se necesite. La atención de Gwénola fue muy buena. Gracias. 
10425414,175246558,2017-07-28,111829737,Laura,This apartment was perfect for our family vacation.  The rooms were spacious and beds are very comfortable.  There was enough room for all of us to have our personal space at the end of a long day of sight seeing.  The neighborhood is great - close to the metro and grocery store.  We loved our stay at this apartment and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a place to stay in Paris.

289892,110075450,2016-10-24,14330354,Rachel,Appartement fonctionnel ( malgré quelques étagères un peu hautes pour les personnes pas très grandes!!)  au 3e étage d'un immeuble ancien conforme aux photos. Ivan s'est montré réactif et nous a donné toutes les infos nécessaires avec un plan de Paris bienvenu à notre arrivée. Quartier calme et station de transports proche. Au final un pied-à-terre intéressant à tout point de vue pour quelques jours dans la capitale!
38722780,546086583,2019-10-13,131446664,Yianna,"Communication with Noelle was great - she was prompt at replying. 
Her Airbnb was as described on the fourth floor however it was quite cluttered. This isn’t the best situated Airbnb as it’s far from tourist attractions however it is a 7 minute walk from the train station. 
She wasn’t accommodating as we had to take a taxi ten minutes away from the Airbnb to pick up the key. This was said to us a few hours before we were meant to arrive."
18848500,258088495,2018-04-28,22231866,Elena,Perfect location in a very picturesque Montmartre! Quite crowded area in April on WE but the apartment is located in a very quite place close to Basilique du Sacré-Cœur. The apartment is equipped with everything you need microwave toaster and even the washing machine! Lots of brasseries and bakeries nearby the host was very friendly and helpful. Strongly recommended for couples!
17861179,528553890,2019-09-13,168990575,Carrie,Very safe neighborhood I wasn’t scared at all walking alone at night. Yingtong was very nice and thoughtful. Perfect place to stay for a solo traveler.

8949356,61719244,2016-02-07,56583578,Emma,"On arrival we were shown around the place which we was very impressed with. 
We asked if we could stay a few more hours rather then check out by 12 as our train wasn't untill the evening and she was more then happy for us to do so if no one else was checking in. 
your pretty much in the heart of town and lots of stuff near I.e shops cafes ect. The apartment is on a busy street and is on the ground floor so get people walking past your window constantly can be noisy as the apparrment is opposite to bars that are open till late. Also there was no wifi which I don't think was added in the listing anyway but on arrival we was told there was but we could never get it to work.Other then this the stay was really lovely. "

30581358,459980772,2019-05-28,59090541,Nicole,Vianney’s clean and stylish apartment was absolutely perfect for our stay in Paris. Her apartment is centrally located in St Germain next door to bars restaurants cafes and places to visit. Vianney is extremely helpful and very readily available via messenger which made getting in/out of the apartment seamless. I highly recommend her place to complete your trip to Paris!
26827,2264103,2012-09-11,3215329,Tone,The stay at Jeromes place made the Paris trip extra nice. The feel of the place was excellent! Jerome was not home during our stay but we were welcomed in an excellent way by his sister. Highly recommended!

566668,5411247,2013-06-29,5821178,Kristen,Lola was an absolutely perfect host. My husband and I traveled Europe for two weeks and stayed through air bnb in each stop. Lola was one of our best hosts. She was extremely detailed on how to get to her apartment and even sent us a list of restaurants and all sorts of things to do all over Paris. She was easily accessible as well which was wonderful.

22006707,472691559,2019-06-20,151241788,Joann,The apartment was perfect!! It was just as described with a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower.  The apartment was very clean and there was even a bottle of wine waiting for us. The building was very secure. We enjoyed sitting on the balcony for breakfast and also in the evening watching the Eiffel light up with twinkling lights. I highly recommend Denis as a hostess and the apartment.

The flat is well designed for six people which my friends and I loved it.
However if you wanna cook there don't forget to bring/buy some spices with you.
The air flow is a bit complicated because you only have a window next to the living room but it's fine to handle!"

23710430,464312115,2019-06-05,119482732,Caleb,The location is great in a neighborhood quarter of Paris central with easy access to the 13 line on the metro. Grocery stores and local restaurants are nearby. Wi-Fi was fast and Claire provided easy access. Did not get to meet Claire unfortunately but her friend Claudia checked us in and was very accommodating with letting us check in early. Claire responded to all of my messages quickly and gave me all the information I needed. This was a great stay for my wife and I and definitely helped us enjoy Paris.
3549658,555197083,2019-10-27,125503516,Mónika,Really good location! The metro is 5 minutes from the apartment. Good wifi tv channels. Lovely apartment but it needs a little renovation (the kitchen and a bathroom mainly). A door in front of the flat is so loud. It is not Jassim fault but it was disturbing. For me it wasn't enough dark at night because of the curtain but it is just for my opinion. The kitchen and the bathroom is so small but you can see on the photos. For two girls was good but for a taller man over 80 kg it wouldn 't be comfortable. Anyway it was good for 4 night. Thank you for the flower! It was so nice.

3776975,103161794,2016-09-20,24548972,Ashley,Overall we enjoyed our stay at William's place. Our flight schedule changed and William did everything he could to accommodate our early arrival which was greatly appreciated. He was also very responsive prior to our arrival and while we were waiting for the place to be ready. The apartment was as described; my only complaints are that the apartment was stuffy and warm despite a fan and 50 degree temps at night. I'd also recommend new sheets as the ones provided were scratchy and uncomfortable. There were extra pillows that were dirty-looking and had no pillow cases too. Other than these minor complaints I'd recommend staying at William's place. The location is perfect and we had everything we needed.
13638003,177612078,2017-08-03,116303757,María,Alain es muy amable. El departamento es tal cual está descripto. Muy cómodo limpio y cálido. La ubicación es excelente cerca del metro Notre Dame (a 5 minutos aprox a pie). El barrio es muy tranquilo. Sin dudas lo volvería a elegir.

4103192,147644739,2017-04-28,58822599,Daniel,"I can't recommend Antoine's place highly enough. It's in a great location near lots of boulangeries patisseries bistros cafes and shops not to mention the Lourve.

Antoine has gone to great lengths to ensure everything you will need is here. As we had been traveling through England for a few days already so the washing machine and heated drying rack were a bonus.

The rear facing terrace was great and secluded."

25067654,310179570,2018-08-19,192644954,Arlette,small space but Danni is super helpful! I personally wasn't a fan of the area but we spent the majority of our day walking around the city so it wasn't a big deal. 
668799,78727623,2016-06-08,48573704,Luis,Best location in Paris and amazing host! Panagiotis was waiting for us when we arrived and he explained everything we needed to know for our stay here! Definitely will come back here when we are in Paris!
28142328,530586300,2019-09-16,34439621,Veronica,The place is neat and spacious as described. It’s closely located to public transportation. The service is disappointed though. They usually don’t reply in time. As it happens I had issue with the washing machine which didn’t work properly trapping a batch of my clothes inside. I contacted the team right away yet they waited until almost 6pm on Sunday to reply saying that they couldn’t do much since it was late on a Sunday. Since I left on  Monday the issue wasn’t resolved properly. They even wrote back to blame it on me because I told them I couldn’t get back to the apartment before 8pm when they called at almost 6pm. I think that’s a very immature way of handling the issue. If you want to stay here don’t expect timely service and also a working washing machine.
3964282,78374760,2016-06-06,25444708,Sheila,Although small the apartment was charming and had everything we needed.  The location is excellent situated a comfortable walk to trains and buses and only a 10 minute train ride into the centre of Paris.  The nearby street has a wonderful array of shops cafes and restaurants as well as market stalls selling fresh produce.  Karine was very helpful and responded quickly to any questions we had.
10939388,488685888,2019-07-15,18866751,Carolina,The flat has an excellent location and has everything you need. It is very clean. I wouldn’t doubt to stay here again!

There are a lot of cafes and bakeries in this area."
5332989,124194154,2017-01-01,96533559,Olivia,The apartment was very spacious and clean in a nice neighborhood. Cute bakery right around the corner. Getting to the tourist sights took 10-20 mins by taxi. Checking in was very easy and I would definitely recommend Francine's place to a friend!

L'appartement était parfait pour y passer mes 4 nuits. Il y a tout ce dont on a besoin. Je pense que je pourrais passer mon séjour une autre fois dans son appartement et dans ce quartier tranquille.

Guido was a very welcoming host.
He showed me how everything works in the apartment.
The apartment was perfect to spend my 4 nights. It has everything you need. I think I could spend my time again in his apartment in this quiet neighborhood.

You can see rooftops and Notre Dame from the upstairs window. Josephine’s Bakery is around the corner and the perfect stop for a croissant and other breakfast items! 

Valerie was accessible and helpful with any questions we had on our stay relating to her home or the city in general. I felt safe and secure at all times in the St Germain neighborhood and in her home."

14851251,189567021,2017-09-02,10299250,Magda,Das Hotel liegt ideal gegenüber dem Bahnhof Gare du Nord in Paris. Man braucht nur über die Strasse in den Bahnhof rein zu gehen. Gut um von dort weiter mit dem Eurostar nach London zu reisen. Das Zimmer hat ein grosses stabiles Doppelbett und man hört von der Strasse nichts da das Fenster in den Hinterhof rausgeht. Viele nette Cafés in nächster Umgebung und die Kirche Notre Dame ist in Gehdistanz ( 15 Min. zu Fuss). Das Personal an der Reception war hilfsbereit und nett.Das Zimmer ist allerdings sehr klein  dafür ist die Dusche umso grösser. Das Preis/ Leistung Verhältnis  ist sehr gut doch ich  würde das Zimmer nicht für einen längeren Aufenthalt empfehlen da es sehr eng ist für zwei Personen.

11579663,73708741,2016-05-09,9427926,Roman,"Ghislaine was very nice and helpful even hurried to let us in to the appartment a bit earlier. She also gave us some tips about the marais where to go where to eat etc. and also had little city maps ready for us. The appartment is in an perfect location litterally right around the corner from rue de bretagne where there are a lot of ""terasse"" and the marché des enfants rouges however since it is in a little side alley the appartment itself is nice and quiet. It is approx. a 5min walk from metro republique so you can get everywhere quickly. The apparment itself is qutie big with a nice living room very bright with alot of windows kitchen is very well eqiupped so you can cook if you are in the mood. In summary it is 100% recommendable!"

20421901,538832338,2019-09-30,208774062,Renjano,"Had a lovely stay at Sun’s place. It’s at the heart of Le Marais so lively and happening at all times. It was a cosy little place just perfect to rest and recover after walking around the whole day. Walking distance to metro and bus stops plus great shopping spots nearby. 
The kitchen area was well-equipped with all the necessities including a Nespresso machine which was a bonus. 
Very safe and secure even for solo female travellers. 
Sun was a sweetheart and always very quick to respond to any queries. 
Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Paris.

2574780,457082617,2019-05-23,58714411,Ruby,Our stay at Inès’ place was great! We were two small families and we fit comfortably and cozily. With small children we didn’t want to waste time on the metro to see the many beautiful sites of Paris so the central location was perfect! Inès was quick to respond to our messages and even provided extra items for our children. We received the warmest welcome from her mother. We highly recommend you stay here for your visit to Paris!

1333691,454914227,2019-05-19,82473688,Krypton,Very comfortable flat at the ground floor of an upscale apartment complex in an excellent neighborhood ! Great for 4 guests. The location is amazing (Montparnasse) with good cafes bakeries sandwich shops local grocers and a supermarket within 4 minute's walk. This is the host's own home so you will find some personal effects in the lockers. Amazing hospitality!
19454986,322137449,2018-09-12,7578294,Lucy,"Isabelle was the most warm hearted host I had a in a long time. She was so great and helped us settle in as weary travellers. Her communication was good her attention to details was great and her home is so eclectic and interesting! Definitely felt like we were Parisian for the weekend. 6 different places to get baguettes in under 30 seconds. Great views!

It’s 1.49 euro per person to get the metro from her place to dead center of the city and I think living in the quieter part of the city is nicer than inside the bustle.

Wifi works great and the water is hot. Window shutters were fun to play with too!"

21183558,481214583,2019-07-04,71201030,Andrew,Jonathan’s apartment was everything we expected with an amazing view of Sacré-Cœur.  The neighborhood was welcoming and friendly with a great multicultural feel.  The nearby market operated daily with fresh fruits and vegetables meats fish and cheeses.  There is a supermarket right around the corner for all your staples like water and beer.  We bought a French press while visiting with our friends and left it in the apartment to save from needing to go buy cappuccinos each morning.  If you travel west and then south along Rue Caulaincourt the street leads right to the Moulin Rouge and there are probably a hundred restaurants bars and shops along the way which is mostly flat.  The apartment is also about a 5-minute stroll to Gare du Nord the train hub which connects to the airport as well as other major trains to get around Paris.  The main refrigerator did not get drinks very cold but there is a secret fridge on the bar that worked excellent for our beer and wine.  Very clean place!

7725395,405490299,2019-01-27,210895148,Tara,The flat is in a great location - the area is lovely and easy to get to transport. As described there are 4 cats in the flat so you must be a cat person. The room was nice but we found the bed and pillows quite uncomfortable. The flat was a bit messy and had a slight odour. However it was suitable for a 2 night stay due to it's location. The hosts were lovely.

12133376,169562421,2017-07-13,69752537,Kevin,This is a wonderful apartment in the beat part of Paris. Airy fun and in a street that constantly lures you out. The art bookstore downstairs was a wonderful surprise and their are plenty of stores within a couple of minutes walk to stock the fridge. The butcher on Rue Bretagne was a favourite with its pre made meals and the fruit shops are excellent. It would take a lifetime to eat your way through the neighbourhood . It is better IRL than in the photos.

352851,70643899,2016-04-19,54095572,Cecilia,Jag har haft en mycket god kontakt med värden från början och fått ett mycket engagerat bemötande. De har skickat oss mycket fin information om bakgrund till att de hyr ut kanon information om lägenheten och Paris. Sedan var mötet med familjen i lägenheten helt suveränt och vi kände oss så välkomna  de har varit så hjälpsamma hela tiden och vi ger dem toppbetyg. Lägenheten överträffade våra förväntningar och vi trivdes verkligen med den och det område som den ligger i. Utsikten var helt bedårande. Vi rekomenderar verkligen detta boende.

The apartment it’s very cozy and clean. It’s location is just perfect and in walking distance to the main attractions as well to the mall and restaurants. We bought food at the supermarket downstairs and were able to cook saving some bucks. Their cat is lovely always trying to play with you.  Hadrian is always willing to help you and gets back to you very fast if you have any questions. Overall everything was excellent.

The apartment is very cute has everything you need and is in a pretty central location. Including heaters which can be very helpful during the cold season.

232293,9141616,2013-12-09,1495750,Kelli,Great place for my friend and I! We liked the location as well as the restaurants in the area. A couple of the days we just metro passes so if there were places we wanted to go that were a bit far we could hop on the metro without it taking long as the metro is right outside the apartment. The place had everything we needed and the kitchen and bathroom were stocked with more than we expected (shampoo cotton swabs sugar coffee). I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a nice place for 2 people.

Very clean beauty and comfortable especially fantanstic location. 10 minutes walking to the gate and 15 minutes to the tower. And the most attractive point to me is the instruction prepared by Marueen not only the facility of rooms but also all living information around the area and tourist information of Paris. And also the kindly help from Zay. This should be the best choose for tourist to Paris.

1113511,304805181,2018-08-10,138190610,Mark,Valérie’s apartment is a very cute space. It had everything I needed during my short stay in Paris. It’s located in the 20th arrondissement which is not very touristy and has a lot of shops bars and restaurants. It’s also very close to Père Lachaise cemetery. Valérie was a very responsive host and answered all of my questions.

L'appart est dans un quartier très sympa il y a des commerces et un vrai marché! Et en plus à deux pas de Sacré Coeur pour les amateurs de voir Paris comme si on y habitait.
13288215,180829295,2017-08-11,142596796,Talya,So marion seemed really nice and I'm sure she's a great person but my overall experience with her was really stressful and as a host I didn't really feel like she showed responsibility for the problems that arose. From the beginning there were problems. This was my first airbnb experience so I didn't know alot of things when I booked with marion. Let's start with when I booked the (Website hidden by Airbnb) messages me a few days before my arrival saying how she doesn't actually have a washing machine even though when I booked that was an option...neigh it was part of the reason I booked with her..OK whatever I didn't make a big deal about it. anyways then she tells me that she doesn't know how I even booked with her since someone else had reserved her place. OK I didn't feel really good about that but she said she'd talk to the guy. Now that wouldn't have been such a big deal if I wouldn't have later found out that this was actually the second time this was happening with her and when I asked her why she hadn't talked to airbnb and tried to find a solution the first time this happened she kind of brushed it off. OK not very responsible but it gets worse. She asked me a couple of days before my flight at what time I'm arriving to get my keys I told her by 1 am I should be there. She answers me on the day of my flight that in that case I have nowhere to sleep that night because the latest time I can come is 12. Now like I said this was my first time using airbnb and I found out after this fiasco that most hosts put the latest check in time clearly on there page so that way you can buy an appropriate flight. She however did not put it up clearly. And in the beginning I blamed myself saying I should have paid more attention to the page before I booked it. However I decided to check said page and even took pictures cause I was so shocked there was no clear time that I saw even when I double checked! I actually booked with someone else after her and saw the times he had very clearly without having to look very hard. So that happened but then I missed my flight to Paris and so I tried to get a earlier flight but for whatever reason it wasn't available so I booked the same time flight for the next day and figured I could try and work something out with marion because no one decent would let another person stay in a strange city overnight especially where they don't know the language and have baggage right? Wrong...she proceeds to very professionally tell me that this is not her problem and that I should try to check in with one of the hostels of which links she sent...

14683167,101178964,2016-09-12,4218425,Andromaca,Magali was waiting for us in her apartment a very cute and cosy apartment exactly as described and looked in the airbnb site! Very close to the metro a 2 min walk maximum in a residential neighborhood full of places where locals attend (a huge plus since I am not a fan of touristic places). A huge plus a creperie just around the corner with the most delicious crepe I ever had! The apartment was spotless very tidy and clean and Magali very welcoming and polite she even left a  full fridge for us to enjoy :). She was always available in case we needed anything! I guess it is the perfect location for anyone who wants to experience the real Paris :) 
1133532,479532200,2019-07-01,51087956,Yasmin,Jean’s place offers great accommodation  for travelers. We were a family of 4 and we had a great time there. The location is very convenient and the tips and directions from Jean was very helpful for us. The place offered AC which was a relief during the heat wave that we experienced during our stay in Paris. All the best to Jean!
2157481,124587013,2017-01-02,67774552,C.,"Boris the owner is a good guy was flexible on my time of arrival gave extensive explanations on the neighbourhood and had some useful maps / sites for us.
The appt. is OK if you do not demand luxury it is safe clean quiet and has the basic needs (heating shower/bath wifi kitchen) pretty well covered. The neighbourhood is not very inspiring but it has two metro stations at a two minutes walk that take you anywhere you want to.

75708,547884117,2019-10-16,45172434,Becca,I visited Paris with my mom for a few days and unfortunately our housing plans were dropped at the last minute. Luckily Faina was more than willing to accommodate our quick booking. We really appreciated her working with us! Her place is tiny but very cute it's the perfect little Parisian apartment. I can imagine that it would be very romantic for couples. While the location wasn't incredibly central the metro is close by so getting around wasn't an issue. Try the croissants from the patisserie across the street - they're the best I've had in France. Merci Faina!

Her place is very conveniently located - near the groceries great restaurants bread/pastry shops - and the famous Rue Cler Market.  It's a short walk away from the Metro station and the Eiffel tower.  Her place was very clean and was perfect for the 4 of us!  Yael was a great host - seeing us off when we left and asking about our experiences.  We would love to stay with her again when we next visit Paris.   Thanks Yael!

The bathroom was new and extremely clean. We faced the street but was not bothered by the sounds from the street. There is a elevator. We also left our luggage on the day of check out and it was a breeze collecting it.

Many little food stores boulangeries and outdoor terraces are just around the corner. The apartment was clean light very comfortable and provided for everything we needed. Located on the top floor and in a very quiet street. Franck was available when needed. The location is perfect for exploring Paris on foot. There's the Arènes de Lutece at the end of the street for kids to play soccer. Two close subway lines give you access to all of Paris. We would highly recommend staying at this apartment! Thank you Franck.

1329018,368823490,2019-01-08,189241021,Madeline,Kathleen was an amazing and thoughtful host.  The apartment is very close to the Arc de Triomphe...if you walk out on the the main street and look right you can see it down the street. There are bus stops and metros within easy walking distance to all the major attractions.  Food is easy to get to. I recommend the Monop' down the street for simple grocery (Website hidden by Airbnb) cheaper than eating out every night. There are at least 3 bakeries within a block of the apartment...the closest isn't the best one so just go down the side street a little and there are two more that are much better.  Kathleen will tell you the best ones...just ask. She has great recommendations and suggestions.  I really enjoyed my stay.
371299,84108157,2016-07-05,18533578,Carlos,"Communicating with Thomas and Manon who assisted with us was very easy.  The apartment is as described. There are little touches that are appreciated such as the welcome kit of water coffee bread and jam. The washer/dryer and a/c is very good. The TV has so many channels including English channels. The internet is good enough for (Hidden by Airbnb) ing home. 
There are pros and cons to staying in this apartment location wise. Pros: you're right at the heart of the area once you go down everything is there it is awesome in its convenience. But by the same measure it is rather noisy overall to get a good night's sleep you need to close all the windows and turn on the A/C because otherwise even in the early morning when they clean the street and pick up the trash it is pretty noisy. We had the misfortune of staying here the same weekend as the Gay Pride Parade it was festive and great to watch but it was also right outside the apartment window for the whole night. Again Pros and Cons. Overall the apartment is as advertised and very good as far as Airbnb's go. The location is where I think it is a bit too much in the heart of the party or bar scene. "

We loved the balcony and well stocked kitchen and washer/dryer.  We were there for Roland Garros so having tv access to check on scores later after touring the city was awesome!  There are plenty of stores and restaurants nearby but the actual street is quiet.  My only complaint is the bed in our room sat on the floor (but it's a king!) and there was no place to hang our clothes in a wardrobe but that would not keep me from staying here again! We highly recommend this place.

32042208,431916105,2019-04-02,136958826,Wendy,The place was an absolute dream to stay in. From the quirky interior furniture to the lovely terrace seating area (which we used to our advantage during breakfast) our stay at Alizée’s place was a lovely experience. We were greeted by a lovely representative who made sure everything in the apartment worked (e.g. wifi and hot water etc). Alizée was very prompt in her responses to any of our questions and was very accomodating. The place was also conveniently located next to many supermarkets great spots for dinner and the metro. Would definitely recommend this place!
18310832,417419950,2019-02-27,62125525,Alena,If you want to know what is the best apartment in Paris? I will answer you - this one! Under the roof (but there is an Elevator!!!!) Windows in all directions very bright and large apartment and from the window you can see the Eiffel tower! Everything you need for life and to feel like a true Parisian (equipment in the kitchen washing machine and dryer dishes bed linen and towels - all in abundance). Great location - close to the metro . Lots of shops restaurants and everything. I stay here for the second time and do not want to leave. I will definitely come back!!!!
728737,403053137,2019-01-20,117450700,Diane,Perfect location lovely and comfortable.  Would stay here again if can be guaranteed wifi would be available.
1253142,152966172,2017-05-19,110739573,Michael,Mélanie’s apartment is great.  It's a very funky apartment and well decorated; very bright and cheery.  The location is very convenient.  There are two metro stops nearby plenty of restaurants and yet quiet and private at the same time.  I can highly recommend staying here.
21947814,339812632,2018-10-22,9493812,Giulio,"Aude è stata un'ospite perfetto super disponibile e gentile. 
Il giorno del check in abbiamo chiesto se potevamo lasciare le valigie e Aude ci ha permesso di rimanere tutto il giorno perchè non sarebbe arrivato nessuno un piccolo gesto che fa sempre molto piacere.
La casa invece è una piccola chicca in un quartiere veramente carino e non turistico pieno di ristoranti e luoghi interessanti da visitare lontano dalle classiche mete turistiche.
In più è collegato benissimo con i mezzi (la metro è a 200metri) e a 1km da Le Marais.
Assolutamente consigliato!"

15574312,552651450,2019-10-22,63409019,Nicholas,This is an amazing space. Palatial completely Parisian and the antithesis of your standard anodyne hotel room. If you want a truly authentic bohemian pad then stay here. Also the quietest place I have ever stayed you really would have no idea you were in the centre of a bustling city.  As a family we loved being there real room to roam and Gregory could not be more helpful. I have to give a word of warning. There are no doors between the main rooms so if its more than one couple staying then privacy is somewhat limited. Also it could really do with a good clean. This seems to be a common theme with past reviews. If you are not too fastidious about such things I can highly recommend it. The sheer grandeur and old school romance override all else.
31331353,479725005,2019-07-01,4521770,Yojin,I cannot recommend staying here for a few reasons. The apartment and room are tiny so you can hear everything that is happening. Also the room is right next to some neighbors who play loud music and stay up talking audibly late past midnight. The towel that was provided was not dried properly and had an unpleasant odor. It was one night I barely slept and it was not comfortable. You can get more quiet privacy and cleanliness at a similar price at nearby hotels.
12350106,417440968,2019-02-27,8922329,Audrey,Très bien ! Apparemment spacieux habité donc très bien équipé et très bien placé. Attention cependant aux sommeils sensibles qui peuvent être dérangés par les bruits de la rue. Sinon au top !
24506651,284224144,2018-07-01,948868,Laurel,Simon’s place was perfect for our trip to Paris. We could walk to the metro and sites around the city very quickly. Though it’s located in a lively neighborhood the apartment was very peaceful and quiet since the windows open up to the garden. We loved all the artwork and the design of the space too!
18766792,405093557,2019-01-26,128523184,Bertrand,L’hôtel la Louisiane accueille des voyageurs de tous pays mais aussi des bordelais de plus en plus. Du coup il y règne toujours une ambiance conviviale et accueillante. Souvent le soir des clients partagent une bonne bouteille de Bordeaux en refaisant le monde racontant leurs voyages ou simplement leur journée à Saint-Germain des Prés. AU fond La Louisiane est un moteur efficace contre le poids subis des routines sclérosantes et demeure ainsi depuis deux siècles un levier magique  pour la création et l‘activité intellectuelle.
5818138,527601889,2019-09-11,139351945,Jeff,"Bonjour
Our brief stay with Caroline was magnificent!
She was very informative and welcomed us upon arrival. She has an elegant and spotless  flat on a quiet Parisian street not far from all the sites and activities. Every morning we were treated to a light breakfast of fresh fruit juice jams and coffee. She truly was a wonderful host and I would recommend her place to anyone looking for a proper and peaceful stay in Paris."
17298430,322060170,2018-09-12,202122229,Audrey,Si le logement et les équipements étaient bien entretenus ce serait un endroit parfait malheureusement tout ou presque est dans un piteux état. Mis à part part le mobilier tout est brisé taché ou pas propre les ustensiles la vaisselle les draps etc. Points positifs: localisation idéale et logement sécuritaire. Wifi illimité en tout temps.

If no car a metro is within 400m and another 600m.

Place was perfect for us. about 3 - 5 min walk to Champs Ellessle 15 - 20 min for Effile Tower maybe the same from Louver.

Fridge sat TV decent sized bed good neighbour hood safe great bathroom living room.

Honestly great value great place to stay great host who organised everything we asked for.

N'hésitez pas."
25282108,414587923,2019-02-20,9336567,Justin,"This apartment was a fantastic stay! Anastasia was a tremendous host by being super responsive with her communication and answered any questions that we had during our stay. 

The apartment itself was clean when we arrived and there was plenty of space for us to unpack all of our luggage into the closet. The apartment has a small kitchen but we didn’t use it during our visit since the apartment was so close to so many amazing restaurants. 

Speaking of location that was probably the biggest allure for this apartment. Every day we could see the Eiffel Tower when we were returning or leaving the apartment. It is also close (about 3 minute walk) to a subway stop (easiest way to travel around Paris) which we used to go to Disney the Palace of Versailles Moulin Rouge and the airport. 

When we return to Paris we will definitely be looking to return to this apartment!"
27018796,415625818,2019-02-23,144929449,Meissane,Jean-Guilhem est un hôte tres arrangeant et à l’ecoute. L’appartement est parfait pour un couple ou une personne seule et contient tout le nécessaire notamment pour cuisiner ce qui est très pratique. Il est idéalement situé dans un quartier calme sûr mais neanmoins animé. Mon séjour était super. Je recommande très fortement !
13165246,484004582,2019-07-08,28234181,Christin,Das Apartment ist toll gelegen! Wir könnten die Stadt fast vollständig zu Fuß erkunden. In der Nähe gibt es viele tolle Restaurants Bars und Shopping-Möglichkeiten. Das Apartment ist im zweiten Hinterhof sehr ruhig gelegen. Es ist klein und erfüllt seinen Zweck.

13693386,109404702,2016-10-21,77421961,Robert,Lovely apartment that has everything you need for a great stay in Paris. Hosts were lovely and took time to show us around the apartment. Central location near the marais and a short metro trip to all the sights. The area itself has many cool places right on your doorstep. Highly recommended. Also love the balcony
1926698,221203014,2017-12-25,23241993,Joana,I had to cancel my stay last minute because my husband got sick. However Regine was very understanding. Throughout the whole renting process Regine always answered politely and promptly. I would like to stay at her place at another occasion.

Tem o cuidado de deixar um mapa e assim que efetuamos a reserva nos dá o plano de como chegar vindo do aeroporto. O quarto é simples e tem escada mas a localização é privilegiada. O metrô está bem perto e pode-se ir andando à Torre Eiffel. O bairro é bem servido de restaurantes cafés supermercado e lavanderia realmente uma bela localização.

13561167,364123376,2018-12-30,4834802,Michelle,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Michael and Johanna's. After 3 nights in a teeny tiny hotel room it was great to spread out a little bit! I loved drinking my coffee at the table in the window and people watching while the streets came to life. We had no problem with street noise (but we were there in the winter and we do live in NYC so I suppose it is all relative). The neighborhood is lively and close to everything though there is so much to do nearby that you don't even need to leave. There were plenty of thoughtful amenities that made life easier - a nespresso machine washer/dryer hair dryer and straightener.  We would be thrilled to make this our Parisian home away from home and hope to get back soon! Merci Michael and Johanna!
7771595,515738179,2019-08-23,212740855,Linda,"Very near to various metros. Lovely apartment building with lots of character. 
Very compact. We had to fold up the bed/setttee in the morning so we could move around easily
It worked for us but shower is very narrow so you would struggle if you are tall or large."

168757,35085461,2015-06-15,3292881,Duncan,Great apartment situated in a quiet courtyard. The apartment is located close to numerous spots in Marais is close to the metro and is walking distance to most of the sites in Paris. The layout of the apartment was fine for us (3 people) and having a functional kitchen was useful. Would stay in this apartment again.
6230859,177807620,2017-08-04,114949142,Andrea,Very good position near to Ramboteau metro station and quiet. Perfect communication with Juliette who has replied to all my messages very clearly and fast. Fourth floor with no elevator but not a big deal after all. 
16457,2959981,2012-11-25,4049165,Matt,Just as described — a cozy cute studio right in the heart of the Marais area of Paris. It's a wonderful location and perfect place to crash and relax after walking the streets all day.

Как будто мы побывали в гостях у хороших друзей. "
4579770,36086579,2015-06-25,28086826,Suzana,The apartment was small  but overall great looking and very well equiped. There was a metro station and bus station nearby and lots of bakeries shops and restaurants around. I would recommend it for 2-3 people. The only problem was when we arrived to the adress the entrance in the building was locked and there was no sign on the bell. I was happy I had Diegos number in my mobile phone so I had to call him...
565243,6794593,2013-08-25,7947858,Nicole,Natalie was so nice and accommodating. The apartment was beautiful and in a nice part of Paris with plenty of access to public transportation. Her roommate was also very nice and offered help when asked. My only complaint is her roommate has a dog who is very friendly but barks a lot at strangers. Overall a wonderful stay! 
2449295,60323219,2016-01-22,41491222,Tomohiro,Christophe is a nice guy. He is helpful and kind. He told me everything I need know and answered what I asked. I think choosing this house is good decision.

Il connaît très bien le quartier et ses bonnes adresses.
Nous on conseille le restaurant de la Rotonde pour les Amoureux!
Un appartement que l'on recommande!
 
The flat is very cozy and quite pictures are aligned with what we have found.
Alain is really welcoming; he took the time to answer our questions. He knows all the good places around!
The romantic restaurant called “La Rotonde” is our favorite!
We recommend that flat!"
1359986,157185127,2017-06-03,52046535,Zongxuan,Margaux is a super nice lady she's very helpful kind informational and considered. The apartment is very nice under 5 min walking distance to the Miromesnil station and under 15 min walk to the Alexander III bridge and Champs Elysse. There is a small shop right down the building and Monoprix 3 blocks away. You can basically get any food within a mile radius ( Creperie bakery bar cafe Asian burgers etc.) I would definitely stay here again for future trips to Paris.

Good location as it’s close to the train station and has lots of supermarkets restaurants and cafes near by. Laura is super helpful and was flexible with the check in  and the check out.
12125636,68825304,2016-04-06,5637939,Nancy,Capucine gave us great directions to get to her flat and met us right off the metro so we were able to go right in. Her flat was small but perfectly formed clean and with a very comfortable fold-out bed. THE only caution is that the flat is on the 6th floor with no lift so if you have mobility issues it might not be for you. Our stay was perfect communication was great and the location was good too. Would absolutely stay again! :) Merci pour l'accueil chaleureuse et pour votre gentillesse Capucine!

And just around the corner is the Rue Dauphine and the best outdoor cafes.   But the apartment has a central courtyard - very quiet.  Beautiful trees and birds - it was lovely.  Very nice space - very clean - extremely comfortable.  We loved it and would recommend to anyone staying in Paris.

Wided était là pour nous recevoir et pour nous présenter son appartement.  C'est une adresse que je recommande fortement. Nous y reviendrons avec plaisir à notre prochain passage à Paris. Merci Wided pour les petites attentions comme les tickets de métro la bouteille d'eau minérale et aussi les chaussons  pour y glisser les pieds fatigués des longues ballades à Paris.

817495,27225043,2015-02-28,6427724,Anca,"Good size apartment (for Paris :-) with a large living/kitchen and a small bedroom. Both sofas open in beds - the larger one quite comfortable - which came rather handy for the three of us since the bed in the bedroom is a French double - meaning 140 x 190.

Secured building and rather calm neighborhood although a little bit off center but with good connections.

Well stock kitchen and great water pressure in the shower. The bathroom could use a fresh painting and the shower a deep cleaning.

Gael welcomed us with his family and hand over a very well done house-book - you receive it when you book the apartment and is really handy.

Overall a good value for money for Paris."

2677394,169616950,2017-07-13,4380835,Scott,Eric's large space by Paris standards was homey and inviting. Some airbnb stays feel like an empty space you're renting. This is a HOME and a grand one by the standards of what we've been used to staying at in Paris. Lots of personality secluded and close to as much action as you possibly desire. Would definitely recommend it for a group of four or more especially if you have children.
15144077,108923069,2016-10-18,89295317,Alexander,We had a great stay at Cyril's he was very accommodating and a great host!

Ce studio est vite devenus notre chez-nous et nous avons apprécié de s'y retrouver y compris pour diner le soir lorsque nous ne voulions pas ressortir. Tout est adapté chez Berto pour que chacun y trouve tout ce dont il a besoin. Mon ami américain et moi même française ont très vite adopté un rythme de vie à la parisienne dans un bel endroit de la capitale.

20600923,482946556,2019-07-07,26736802,Arnold,Awesome place.  Nathan is very responsive.  Location of the apartment is very good
18604256,453889829,2019-05-17,84020615,John,Glen was very responsive and attentive easy enough to get to central attractions but do your homework no notes or maps in apartment
17582165,160004367,2017-06-12,42704919,John,This apartment is well equipped and really well located. It was easy to travel to the major sites by Metro or bus or you could even walk! There are good restaurants cafes and bars in the area which has a great atmosphere. You can get up to the apartment by using a lift which isn't always available in Paris rentals. The apartment faces into a central courtyard so it's quiet. It was very hot when we were in Paris but we had the windows wide open all night and there was no noise. The overhead fan was pretty effective as well. The bathroom was clean and modern with a good shower. There's an amazingly well stocked small grocery store only a few steps away with very friendly staff (N.B. it's closed on Sunday). Only down side is the bedroom has no windows and the double bed is very large. So if you're sleeping on the far side you have to sidle round the bed or climb over it. But a small price to pay for a great stay!
452481,150243712,2017-05-07,124291077,Aziza,Уютная комната. Когда заходишь впервые кажется что места очень и очень мало но потом быстро привыкаешь. Поговорив с ребятами из Франции стало понятно что это вполне привычная квадратура для Парижа. Хозяйки очень милые леди а то что рядом со станцией метро вообще замечательно! Спасибо большое завтра снова возвращаемся в уютную комнату в Париже.

18623194,264081049,2018-05-13,161719842,Felicia,Alexis flat was amazing! Me and my three friends stayed at her place for two nights and it was very spacious. The location is very good with a 10 minutes walk to the Louvre. Good connections to the metro and a bunch of cozy cafés and restaurants just outside the place. Alexis was very flexible and responded quick to us.

34200953,532156347,2019-09-19,29773967,Tamara,This is a fantastic place to stay in Paris. The comfortable and cozy studio is located in a safe and very stylish neighborhood. I was able to get to all the sites easily. A metro is close by or you can walk. When you look out the window you can see the Eiffel Tower!  The place is clean and very comfortable. I liked being high up on the sixth floor and the elevator made it so convenient! Remy is a very nice and was great at communication. I will stay here again when I come to Paris.
14265920,150594292,2017-05-08,2459938,Echo,Tom and Cindy were great. The apartment is great also big and cozy and on the first floor. Nice location. Would highly recommend this space.
8862585,269930512,2018-05-28,65057123,Eleyse,This home is without peer. Located on Ile St. Louis its location is the best of both worlds -- steps away from the best of Paris but still removed from the tourist hordes. The home itself is beautifully appointed with sleep-inducing beds and linens elegant living room with seating for eight people at least and a remarkable kitchen. Over the course of ten days we went to Catholic mass the grocer bakery wine store and one particular cafe several times  and to our delight were remembered and treated warmly.  One of our favorite rituals though was stepping beyond the private courtyard doors and watching the river traffic  and parade of people on the opposite bank. When we return we will not hesitate to try to stay here again.

I was surprised by the confort of the bed and the apartment have all ammenities and is well equiped. 

Communication with Marleen was quick and easy and the process of arriving and leaving couldn't have been easier. If you're looking for a place in Paris I highly recommend staying here. I'm looking forward to get back on the next year."
6631426,348543280,2018-11-14,44428203,Laura,"Odelia’s place is close to all the beautiful cafes and action of Montmartre but the apartment itself is very quiet - great for a good night’s sleep. The location was ideal for us as there were so many good breakfast/bakery options within a 5 minute walk (Boulangerie Alexine was one we really liked) and also the apartment is not far from several metro stations/bus stops. We did the Sandeman’s Montmartre tour (meets by the Starbucks across from Moulin Rouge...a quick walk from the apartment) on our first morning there so that was a nice way to get a good feel for the area and hear interesting stories about Montmartre. 

The apartment itself is as pictured and a good value.

Something to consider - if you are a large person you may have trouble with getting in and out of the shower (I am currently fairly far along in pregnancy and it was pretty hard to get through the shower door ha. 

Also a tip - if you arrive at night you will have to push the small button (looks kind of like a doorbell) by the entry door into the stairway to light up the first few sets of stairs and then another button on Odelia’s floor. 

We didn’t get to meet Odelia in person but she was very friendly and quick to respond to messages. Thanks for a good stay Odelia!!"
14553095,367148984,2019-01-04,48958650,Trisha,Le studio est vraiment petit et convient à une personne.  Carole a pris soin d’utiliser intelligemment chaque centimètre de son studio. Le studio est bien placé et on est à 10-20 Minutes de tous les monuments de Paris et à 5 Minutes métro. Le quartier est animé mais une fois dans le studio on est au calme.

12647152,543705774,2019-10-08,102435125,Mary,"Marcello’s apartment is a perfect base for exploring Paris and is ideally located in the trendy Marais district.

It is on the fourth floor of the building with a lift which was handy for us with luggage. 

The apartment is very large by Parisian standards with a lovely roof top terrace area and modern finishings appointments and nice linen.

Being located in the trendy Marais district meant there are an abundance of lively cafes restaurants and wine bars within a short walk of any direction from the apartment. There are also multiple grocery stores just a short walk from the apartment. 

This central location also means it is only ever about a 20 minute walk to reach many of the main attractions; the Latin Quarter  Notre Dame or to the Louvre . 

I would recommend this apartment if you are ever visiting Paris and wanting to stay in the Marais district."

13255763,321483875,2018-09-10,88553977,Jacob,Vincent's apartment is located very central with only a few minutes walk from Notre Dame. The apartment was very clean however one should bring own blankets to sleep with. The apartment had sheets on the bed enough towels and two pillows for sleeping. The pictures are very true to the apartment and the location is as good as one could expect. I would gladly recommend renting Vincent's apartment!
27485047,336297771,2018-10-14,197733885,Kirsten,Lots of natural light and tons of space for 4 people!

15866079,135750774,2017-03-06,17468248,Sharla,"The apartment was perfect exactly what you need. Quiet place not on the street-side of the building. Laetitia was very very open nice and clear in her communication we did not meet but she explained and left everything perfect. The bed sleeps very well the couch is a little less comfortable but maybe that's because my boyfriend and me are quite tall. Everything was superclean and worked well. I loved the decoration which is not essential but a great extra ;) 

The location was nice 10 minutes walk from Gare du Nord where we arrived. And within half an hour you could be almost anywhere with the subway. At first we felt we could not come back to the apartment with the subway at night in this neighborhood but later we did so and felt perfectly safe. Just keep your normal awareness at the subway station because it's a big city I once almost got pickpocketted. There are many nice little african vegetable stores and a small market everyday one street away. "

17522117,282358636,2018-06-27,10537094,Jennifer,Laurence’s place was the perfect spot for a stay in Paris. The room was just right for our needs. The location could not have been better. We were just steps from the Seine and Notre Dame cathedral. The metro and RER stops were just outside. Close to shops and food. Laurence was the most fabulous host. The breakfast was beyond compare every morning. Some days we left early to catch the sites but were able to spend time talking with Laurence also. Her family was wonderful even Nelson the cat. Laurence and Frank were so helpful with navigating the city and making the most out of our time there. The airline lost my daughter’s bag and they went out of their way to help us get it back even making phone calls for us. 
25450961,272073138,2018-06-03,133058226,Kevin,The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2849221,340909559,2018-10-25,50776974,Deanna,"The location is why you stay here!  It is very walk-able and surrounded by lots of great restaurants and things to see.  We found it super easy to get everywhere by foot or a quick metro ride. 

The being said the space is what you expect from the photos.   It was clean spacious and the bed was very comfortable!  We liked having a separate bedroom from the living space. We also found that the VERY small elevator was still nice after a long day of walking however the stairs are very doable as well. 

The con's here are fairly minimal.  The space is very old with some broken tiles and dips in the wood.  It's a very ""bachelor pad"" style of decor with no real thought put into the aesthetic.  We weren't spending any time beyond sleeping at the apartment though so we didn't really mind.   I was a little disappointed when I went to run a load of laundry on the last day.  I had specifically about detergent before arriving and at check-in and was told both times that he would provide.  When I grabbed the bottle he had indicated at check-in it was completely empty so I ended up essentially ""rinsing"" my clothes without soap.  There also was damp smelly laundry still in the washer from before our stay (which also explained why our bath towels smelled moldy/musty).

We had some issues with the electricity breaker popping (once overnight with nothing on/plugged in once while we were gone all day) however Ludo responded right away with clear instructions on how to fix ourselves so it was not an issue.

Over all we had a nice stay and would recommend staying here if you are looking for a comfy bed in a great location!"

Pascal muy buen anfitrión  nos dejó café y hielos de cortesía .
Mis amigas y yo la pasamos muy contentas lo volveríamos a rentar . 
El único inconveniente son las escaleras  está en el segundo piso y es un poco molesto la subida y bajada de maletas   consideren no llevar maletas muy grandes y pesadas ☺️"
34669985,552273587,2019-10-21,193022051,Olivia,The bar/cafe/restaurant right next door is reasonable but there's a gem of a restaurant on another corner of the square only I can't remember the name.  Quaint and cosy with proper food and wine and great service. Quintessentially French. Barely more expensive than the cafe. The park in the square is very elegant. Didn't explore the area fully but I'd return to see more.

6803808,500384164,2019-08-02,185415874,Shatha,The place was small but close to metro station which is convenient. The communication with the host was somewhat unpleasant. Also make sure you could meet the host during the times they provided otherwise its impossible to check in. Overall the place was okay it could of been cleaned  better but had the bare minimum for most things. Plus it had a AC which is a plus during the summer.

Quite close to several subway stations and a lot of cafes and good restaurants. This ""rue"" feels like a new upcoming spot because just before two days I left there is an ""OBEY clothing""  opening just meters away not mention other brands I am not familiar with...And the host is also very nice and quiet always ready to help. Anyway I hope I can go back soon before it becomes too popular!"
5029618,61150401,2016-02-01,31495916,Donna,Nathalie was great during our whole booking process. The apartment is really easy to find. We were a group of six adults so it was a little cosy but it didn't matter as we were out exploring most of the weekend. The apartment is well presented and very well-equipped. Nathalie has thought of everything. Great use of space throughout. We had a lovely stay and would recommend this property to anyone thinking of staying in the Montmarte area. It's also only a 'few' steps away from the Sacré-Cœur.

And the price was great as the Marais can be quite pricey. We were very glad we found it. And Ahmed was absolutely responsive and more flexible than he had to be which we appreciated!
13159460,269818897,2018-05-28,107646050,Victor,"My family stayed with Cedric for about 5 nights. The location of this house is fantastic. It's only about 5 min walk to the metro station with plenty of restaurants groceries stores bakeries and local markets on the way to the metro. The location is very quiet and very safe. We walked way past midnight every night to the house and never felt unsafe. 

The house is charming very well kept and the beds are very comfortable. Cedric and his family are very accommodating and breakfast was served every morning. We felt very welcome in their house.

I would highly recommend Cedric's place for a stay in Paris.

It is also small but ideal for a short stay in Paris. We had a brilliant time and would love to have stayed longer. Thanks!
1315770,139059442,2017-03-23,49098035,Nancy (Hien),Super close to metro would recommend caution when travelling alone at night. Dominique was helpful in travel tips and held our luggage to retrieve at convenient time for us.

1922745,23755562,2014-12-09,10380322,Brian,Great apartment in a fantastic location.   Clean comfortable and recently renovated.  Great value for the money.  The apartment is small and somewhat oddly shaped but it is a great setup for a family with small kids. Two couples or families with more than one older kid might find the space a bit cramped.

François  été très réactif et très à l'écoute dans nos echanges. Bref un appartement idéal pour découvrir Paris à deux.
24495520,272825195,2018-06-04,3137526,Phil,Raphaele’s place was amazing and just what I needed for a quick stay in Paris. All the essentials beautiful courtyard entryway a terrace to a relaxed street and a bunch of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. The bathroom in the hallway was fine. Very nice.

Carole a su me mettre à l'aise et a été pleine d'attentions à mon égard (croissant le premier jour renseignements sur Paris ce qui pour un provincial est important en arrivant..) . Très bon accueil donc et une adaptation à mes horaires de travail parfois décalés.  
La chambre proposée est conforme au descriptif et donne sur cour: très calme et aménagée avec goût.
Séjour empreint de convivialité de bonne humeur et de gentillesse.
A recommander !
Merci encore Carole..."
8657655,80801351,2016-06-19,15431423,Simen,"Great appartment in great area. Marc was really friendly and helpful and even had a fresh Baguette and cold beers and wine ready for us upon arrival. The appartment was at the 7th floor without elevator but the 360 view of Paris from the rooftop balconny is worth it. Consider the stairs a free workout! ;)

Renting this appartment from Marc is definitely recommended!"

642059,16482361,2014-07-28,16498666,Luigi,La stanza risponde in pieno all' annuncio . Metro a 200 metri ed autobus 72 che porta in pieno centro percorrendo tutto il lungo Senna . Il climatizzatore si e' dimostrato utilissimo in alcune notti molto calde. Bernard si e' sempre mostrato  disponibile alle mie richieste. Tutto ok !!!
36213126,502935022,2019-08-05,152939852,Lorena,Andrea was very welcoming and tried her best to make me feel at home. She’s a very lovely person with a beautiful artistic side and you can feel it in the decoration! And the hammac is amazing. Also It’s 5 minutes walk to Sacrée cœur!
22626000,474481120,2019-06-23,35332505,Lauren,"It’s literally a block away from moulan rouge. Because it’s so close to the action and you’re on the second floor you faintly hear the noise from the street through the night unless you sleep with a white noise machine like I do. But the location is perfect for going places like Luz Verde Flesh Pink Mamma Glass and all the spots in the cross section next to Le Loft. I don’t recommend staying in this area with kids as there are adult shops surrounding the hotel. 
The place is spotless. 
You will have to give a credit card for incidentals when you check in. 
You will also have to pay cash for the hotel tax (about 3.70€ per day). 
The walls are thin so you can hear your neighbors. 
The rooms are not connecting - and the person in the second room has to come to the main room to take a shower. They provide shampoo/body wash and body lotion- no conditioner.  This set up is really nice for friends or family traveling together. Really good price for what you get."
1513921,13598339,2014-06-01,11637195,Елена,Communication with owners above any praises!!!Murielle and Cecileery are benevolent and friendly people.Apartments surpassed all our expectations.
288141,316065030,2018-08-30,37851036,Andrew,Good affordable accommodation in Paris  for its price very reasonable.  Could do with a little tidying up and not ideal in summer with the noisy trains  however not an issue for us too much as we are used to living in a noisy city.
6076526,306873129,2018-08-13,196263175,Suco,Departamento increible tiene todo lo necesario y muy cerca del metro. 
19130013,173969399,2017-07-24,53467171,James,Good communication before we arrived. Good location right near shops and metro station. Even though it is right near a Main Street it is very quiet at night. Only issue was drilling in the morning quite early (this was only once and I know it's something out of the control of the host). Small kitchen bathroom and toilet but for a short stay with 4 people we were fine.

Мы благодарны за возможность поселиться в квартиру раньше установленного времени. Это было очень важным для нас. Даже не зная французский язык мы могли общаться и понимать друг друга. Шикарная квартира для 4 человек. Чисто уютно удобно тихо очень комфортно. Важный момент - наличие двух ванных комнат для 4 гостей утром не стояли в очереди а очень быстро все собирались на экскурсии. Есть все необходимое для приготовления еды  прекрасный интерьер. Замечательная коллекция джазовой музыки. Мы благодарны за доверие к нам. До новых встреч! Всем рекомендуем эту квартиру она в реальности лучше чем на фото.

It's beautifully decorated spacious and comfortable  The bathroom and kitchen ultra-modern and completely stocked with anything you might need.  Best of all the neighborhood is wonderful.  A close walk to the Marais Notre Dame the Louve and very close to the lively market and restaurant street Rue Montorgueil.  I recommend it completely!
34075057,445912934,2019-04-30,22465334,Valentina,"WOW what a gem of a place! 

A stylish Parisian chic practical studio with a super cosy upstairs bedroom. Better than a suite in one of the famous 5 star luxury hotels in Paris! 

Very central and close to many typical brasserie and eateries local shops supermarkets banks. 

It had everything I needed  and more to spend a week away on business. It also has a cute small private outdoor area where you can actually hear birds in the morning it is so quiet!

Paco and Philippe being extraordinary hosts made it feel like home from the minute I stepped in. Amazing hospitality.

Great location to;It is close to three metro stations walking distance to Montmartre Opera Gare du Nord and Gare du L’Est. 
Can’t wait to go back!!!"
16992820,314742262,2018-08-27,63573936,소영,우선 사진보다 훨씬 더 매우매우 예쁘고 감각적인 공간임은 분명합니다. 2-3분거리에서 버스를 타면 금방 파리 중심부로 이동할 수 있다는 것또한 매우 좋았고 역도 가까웠습니다. 또 파리의 핵심적인 중심지가 아니다보니 물가가 싸다는 느낌도 받았습니다. 다만 쇼파나 침대가 조금 불청결하다는 느낌을 받았고 쇼파(?)가 삐그덕거리고 전혀 편하지 않아서  거의 사용하지 못했습니다. 하지만 다시 파리에 간다고해도 Romma의 숙소에 묵을 생각입니다. 핑크색의 큰 욕조(성인 두명도 들어갈 정도의)는 정말 최고였고 식물들이 많고 빛이 잘 드는 큰 창 또한 만족스러웠습니다.
4082672,251170037,2018-04-07,157528030,Rosario,Bianca's place is very nice and conveniently located close to Gare du Nord which is served by several Metro lines. Despite the location it is farily silent and even has a small patio. I really enjoed staying there.
739559,491301704,2019-07-20,16693175,Jennifer,We had a great time on the tour! Wayan was our guide he was really nice and also doubled as our photographer. He even made sure to get in line for us in each spot to make sure we had a chance to get a photo. He was very involved and it was an awesome day!
8442497,102547766,2016-09-18,82946911,Pablo,"Departamento muy bien equipado con electrodomésticos nuevos incluso lavasecarropas que nos vino muy bien por el corto tiempo que estuvimos. Cómodo el tener baño y ducha por separado permite ser utilizado mientras alguien se baña. La ubicación muy buena creo que inmejorable. Cerca de torre eiffel inválidos hay pequeños restorants para comer por la noche.
El inconveniente es que estan arreglando la calle justo delante y el ruido en la semana es imposible comenzando desde las 8 o incluso antes. Aun con ventanas cerradas por ser primer piso el ruido es muy molesto. Si son de levantarse temprano el departamento es muy recomendable. 
Giulia estuvo siempre atenta a los mensajes incluso llamado telefónico ya que no fue tan bien comunicado como localizar el departamento dentro del edificio. Por los ruidos nos era imposible abrir las ventanas pedimos un ventilador y al día siguiente nos lo llevo."

2488505,31494070,2015-05-05,27353864,Anna,Thank goodness for Emma. She set us up so well at the last moment. Provided excellent bedding recommendations a list of restaurants and cafes in the area and was so kind. The place is perfect for a couple has a small kitchen and is in a very safe upscale neighbourhood. Thank you again Emma for your warm welcome and hospitality. 
1993384,457487013,2019-05-24,37091951,Anna Maria,"The apartment is just like the picture what they don’t tell you is located in the street level so you listen to ALL the noise there is whenever people go up the stairs or down. The garbage is just in front of the studio apartment and you can also listen people throwing away everything. The bed matress does not belong to the sofa so when you lay down in the middle it forms like a hole and it’s not firm. On our first night the mailman at 8am starting knocking on the door and it wasn’t for us.
The good thing: neighborhood the bathroom is clean and modern.
The communication with the host; she said I complained too much and that I should move to a 5 star hotel...
I think that people should know before renting this place that is on the lowest level and that you can’t even open the window as it is in the same street level so if you might know this then you would know there might be some noise and the bed issue as well."
8594324,401600646,2019-01-15,2652288,Nancy,Yue‘s apartment is stylish and comfortable with everything we could have wanted. The location is great for public transportation and for strolling around. Communication and check-in/check-out could not have been easier. Her local tips came in handy too.
2961404,148100201,2017-04-30,47197169,Virginia,We did not know Muorad personally because we got there one night for problems during the trip but he was kind and very helpful! The house is as described in the photos. Thank you Mourad!

2574780,45952461,2015-09-07,37864098,Philip,Excellent apartment just as described.  Great location for exploring on foot or by the excellent public transport links.  Very convenient for airports via RER.  Kitchen small but good facilities and very clean.  Broadband very fast and reliable.  On 5th floor via small (2 person) lift so for a group of 3 or more people things are quicker if some people take the stairs.  Excellent shops on both sides of the street it really is the genuine Parisien living experience.  Balcony long and narrow only one person wide but OK for 2 people to sit facing each other. We were also grateful to be allowed early checkin and late departure which made things work better for our flight times.
28126836,323737269,2018-09-16,5808435,Gemma,Wonderful apartment. Super clean and has everything you need. Great location and so quiet. Laurence is a wonderful host and we will definitely be back.
1270666,8885243,2013-11-24,9288696,Kirsty,This apartment is fantastic! Spacious and clean with modern facilities and in a great location. It was perfect for a short stay in Paris and nice that it has two actual bedrooms rather than one bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room. Jerome was there to great us explained everything and arrived on time for the check out. I would definitely stay in his apartment again.

2401938,17836526,2014-08-18,2827854,Xiao,Victor's place was exactly as pictured and was very clean and comfortable. He was a great host as well answering all of our questions and even leaving us an umbrella to use! The location was very convenient close to a Metro station and only a 10 minute walk from Gare du Nord. We would definitely stay at Victor's again the next time we go to Paris!
2435234,230434957,2018-01-28,26495721,Nancy Maxine,"A little corner of Paradise it definitely was. 
We enjoyed every moment we spent in Eugenie’s apartment. We felt very welcome and at home. 

Eugenie and her pet SHEEP where delightfull hosts. She was spot on with connecting with us and she helped us out in anyway she could. 

I highly recommend her. 

And we will surely go back to hers whenever we are in Paris. 

Thanks again!"
7978764,465829228,2019-06-08,21022767,Emily,"WARNING: DO NOT STAY HERE!!! My friends and I booked this AirBnB based on good reviews and its location. Upon arrival we found a complete dump. I wish I could post pictures here. You would run for the hills! It wasn’t just dirty from the last guests; it was as if it had never been cleaned. We canceled and got a hotel instead. 

Here is a summary:
Bedroom
Thick dust on closet shelves
Bedside table lamp knocked over 
Large partially-used water bottle left on bedside table
Anti-mite product found in closet

Kitchen
Sliced onion left in basket on counter
Strong onion smell throughout apartment
Soaking wet dish towel on sink
""Clean"" dishes left out on drying rack; mugs did not look clean
No trash bag in trash can

Living Room
Greasy marks on coffee table with significant dust
Old children's artwork left on counter and tables
Dust/hair balls on the floor

Safety
Listing noted smoke detector and carbon monoxide detector. Smoke detector had been removed and carbon monoxide detector wasn't present.

Bathroom
Fecal matter in toilet; no part of the toilet was clean
Sink counter and mirror covered in dried toothpaste and water splashes
Used bar soap left on counter
Storage bin liners were not clean
1/3 of shower spray nozzles were broken (different than photo in the listing)
Shower door and floor caked in dirt soap scum hair and dust
Footprints on shower floor proved it was not washed
Shower knob broken and not attached to wall

I could go on and on. The management company offered to send a cleaning crew but trust me they were not going to be able to clean it enough to stay there. This place was UNLIVABLE. I can’t believe it’s ever gotten good reviews. We’re in talks with AirBnB to hopefully get our money back!"
11255799,91913631,2016-08-07,12309078,Mimi,The apartment was very clean and tidy. Marie was very responsive professional and kind to all the questions. We will highly recommend her place to stay!

The apartment is nice warm cosy sunny well decorated spacious comfortable and practical.
It is located few minutes walk from le jardin des plantes and from jardin du Luxembourg so we did also enjoy the outdoor neighborhood.

Max has been a very good host omnipresent via text and mail mostly. When we finally met for check out we actually had an excellent conversation.

We do recommend Max's place and would not hesitate to go back."

3348065,295224294,2018-07-23,37373653,Miriam,"Katya’s place was cute artsy and comfortable.  It is located in a safe neighborhood with lots of boulangeries markets and cafes. Easily access the metro and feel secure with a locked lobby building door.  The futon is surprisingly comfortable the courtyard view is romantic.  WiFi communication and cleanliness were all excellent.  

I really appreciated having the electric kettle tea and coffee in the house. We also made eggs on the hot plate and bought cheese and fruit to keep in the small fridge. 

The studio is on the 4th floor and there is no lift but we still made it up and down with our heavy luggage.  

As with many of the old buildings in Europe if you’re a light sleeper bring ear plugs or play sleep sounds to drown out the neighbors. "
16399392,143785231,2017-04-13,57621266,Kenny,Let me start of by saying Michael and Johanna's place was amazing and had everything we needed for the stay. The studio was extremely clean and with my OCD about bathrooms; this place nailed it! Located just a short walk from the Eiffel Tower there was access to everything and it felt like we were right in the middle of the city. Great location for cafes shopping metro etc. When you leave the US and go to another country- this is the kind of place and location you want. The communication was excellent prior to arrival into France all the way through my uber ride back to CDG airport. Would def stay here again! Thank you for everything! 
4384759,39949045,2015-07-27,199247,Bojan,Rue Montorgueil is in one of my favorite Paris neighborhoods to stay in since everything is a short walk away and there are many restaurants cafes supermarkets.  Despite all that life the apartment is very quiet and also roomy. The building even has a (very small) elevator which is not common in Paris. Paul was flexible and arranged for us to get the keys even earlier than initially agreed on. Would definitely stay again.
20242826,486280729,2019-07-12,235842355,Magdalena,Near Metro and easy to get to places. A Boulangerie nearby and a small supermarket. Beautiful park for picnics.

He meant it! You could not ask for a more helpful and friendly host!
Even before our arrival Antonio gave us a few tips and guide us about Paris!
i would say that his place is a great place to stay in situated in a less busy area of Paris but you have everything you need around the area and it is only a few stops from the city we will definitely recommend it!
Do ask for suggestion and recommendation on eatery or place to visit we had savory and sweet crepes that he has recommended simply awesome!
Thanks Antonio!"
26278,129693,2010-10-30,225401,Paul,I found Jeffs apartment to have all the essentials (and more) for a base with which to wander Paris. It was so comfortable to come back to after a creatively inspiring day of exploring. It was a real treat walking out its little blue door and up the steps to the glorious Sacre Couer and then into the artist village of Montmatre. Jeff was a great host and was always available for queries. I really apreciated his recommendation of the family doctor to have my ear unblocked and finally being able to hear Paris. I highly recommend his apartment for the creatively inspired. Regards Paul (Occasional nomad at heart)

The room was small but very clean with a comfortable bed. 
The apartment its self was newly renovated and very nice. It was close to the train station a beautiful park and a few shops and restaurants.

Nadine was great! She was so helpful she offered us dinner on our second night and also gave us a wealth of information on things to do and see and how to find our way around Paris."

Siyoung gave us both general and individual tips on how to make up with Korean cosmetics and what to buy
And I got a lot of compliments like “You look like a doll” when I showed a photo taken after the session
Even after the session she kindly answered my questions and gave more tips than I expected 
I think it’s very effective and efficient to attend this session before shopping!

1230737,39789382,2015-07-26,6160275,Jenny,Matthieu's apartment is lovely and just as it is described and listed on the site. The apartment is light airy and perfectly equipped for self catering. Although we did not meet Matthieu the apartment manager was very helpful gracious and took care of all our needs and storing our luggage upon departure. The neighborhood is fabulous centrally located but away from areas frequented heavily by tourists. The apartment is quiet and situated on a great street with many fantastic food offerings and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again! Many thanks for such a great stay.

Located in a great spot we enjoyed being on the fringe of several arrondisements rather than be located in the centre of the busy Marais. Comfortable bed nice and airy lounge area when you need to take a break and 
with a classic small Parisien kitchen which was very workable. 
Happy to recommend this place - thanks Michel!

Il ne faut pas focaliser sur les 6 étages à pied. Lorsque l'on est à Paris on les monte 1 fois par jour le reste du temps on est dehors. Notre petite fille de 4 ans était avec nous les étages ne l'ont pas rebutée. L'appartement est propre parfaitement équipé très accueillant central. La rue montorgueil à 2 pas permet de faire ses courses au quotidien ou de manger dans un restaurant différent à chaque repas. Nous avons été accueillis par le fils de sylvie qui est très sympathique. Sylvie est douce très à l'écoute et disponible. Je n'ai qu'un mot : allez-y en toute confiance vous ne serez pas déçu.
Merci sylvie pour ce charmant séjour. Nous gardons précisieusement vos coordonnés nous reviendrons. "

It's perfect for a couple or couple with a child. New shower is nice. The area was Great and was close to everything you need. The Eiffel Tower was only a 5 minute walk or so. Nice market nearby. Beautiful view from the window especially at night with the tower sparkling. Tiny elevator to get upstairs but that's expected in these little paris areas. Thanks for a great stay!

A poucos passos as Champs Elyseé estação de metrô próxima mercado na esquina muitas lojas restaurantes e cafeterias nas proximidades. Estava tudo muito limpo e cheiroso. O chuveiro um chuveirinho dentro da banheira foi diferente para nós que estamos acostumados com o chuveiro tradicional tivemos um pouco de dificuldade a tomar banho mas nada que nos fizesse desgostar do apartamento. A cozinha é completa as cortinas eletrônicas as camas ótimas e tudo funcionou perfeitamente lavamos até nossas roupas! Recomendamos muito fomos em 4 adultos e ficamos muito confortáveis!

The environment lighting and small details makes you feel at home while simultaneously making it feel that you are indeed Parisian ;—) 

Perfect to come back to relax and have an evening glass of wine with friends as the golden hour hits just right in this living room.

Mathieu is attentive with friendly check-ins as well as recommendations."

2851172,18664231,2014-08-30,2152411,Elena,Я останавливалась в студии Hélène на 5 дней. Она встретила меня всё показала и предложила свою помощь в случае если у меня возникнут какие-либо проблемы. В студии был идеальный порядок и в ней было всё что мне было необходимо для проживания: полотенца постельное бельё посуда. На случай жары имелся вентилятор на случай холода — масляный радиатор. В шаговой доступности от студии имеется несколько супермаркетов 2 магазина NATURALIA где можно приобрести биопродукты несколько булочных 2 станции метро. Очень быстро можно добраться до центра города. Мне всё очень понравилось! Я буду рада ещё раз остановиться в студии в случае своего следующего приезда в Париж. Hélène спасибо большое!

The location is great - on a pretty street just a stroll from Sacre Coeur tucked away from touristy crowds. There was even a lovely neighbourhood party with live music when we were there! The apartment itself is charming and had everything we needed including cooking equipment and toiletries. Great shower too! Deborah and Patricia checked in on us daily via messages and made sure we had everything we needed plus good restaurant and sightseeing recommendations. 100% recommend - I'll be back!

The apartment is very beautiful and decorated and used in e very creative way! The area is nice close to la coulée verte a path that brings you straight to Bastille.

22540781,549420461,2019-10-18,45569844,Vanessa,A very hospitable place with a friendly and helpful host perfectly located for all ventures into Paris even on foot (15min to Sacré Cœur) and by bus (which we highly recommend for a change). Very calm appartement but stepping out of doors brings you right into a lively quarter day and night. Highly recommences we would come back again to this place.
12165517,131448324,2017-02-12,22066383,Cliodhna,"Exactly what we hoped it would be. 
Near the Eurostar and very clean. 

For 3 adults it was perfect but might be cosy for more than that as only one bathroom and separate loo. 
Secure old building with squeaky parquet floors and plenty of light. 
Perfect for a repeat Paris visit. Allowing us to potter round. 

Such a great area lots of little shops and places to eat and drink. 

Vitalina was great - super responsive and very organised. Well catered for (plenty of loo roll stuff in the fridge etc) and well equipped with towels and linen and the apartment was tidy and clean. 

Will be back!

19849923,217753409,2017-12-10,35434165,Scott,I really enjoyed this apartment! It's perfect for one person or a couple. It's conveniently located to the subway (line 14) and the RER C train - all within a 5 minute walking distance. The bathroom is small but enough for one person to use at a time. I always had hot water in the shower consistently which is highly appreciated (the same cannot be said for other apartments in Paris). The bed is quite large and comfy and kept me comfortable as I was adjusting to jetlag. Unfortunately the elevator was broken during my stay but the apartment is on the 3rd floor so easily accessible via the stairs. I would definitely consider staying here again! :)

Plein de commerces à proximité : boulangerie restaurant bar supérette
À côté du Jardin du Luxembourg et du RER LUXEMBOURG.
SDB un peu petite peut-être faudrait-il changer la cabine de douche qui est très proche des toilettes (pas très pratique pour les grands). Il y manque une prise de courant.
Toutes les prises de courant ne fonctionnaient pas il faudrait mettre plus de couverts. Pas simple sans mode d’emploi d’utiliser la SFR BOX pour regarder la TV.
Le matelas du canapé-lit un peu fin.
La configuration en Triplex est sympa pour que chacun est un espace privatif et son propre lit."

The pictures show it all with 100% accuracy; what you see is what you get. Even the toilet room is around the corner and was always clean. The stairs are indeed narrow and it is 7 flights of stairs so if you're not in good shape or hate exercising this place is not for you. 

Other than that it was quiet pleasant and clean."

Away from the noisy main roads in a quiet area but a short walk to great restaurants supermarket was handy and so was the metro. Super speedy responses from the owners. Highly recommend and I have visited Paris a number of times this was fabulous.
23513585,476840037,2019-06-27,21333147,Joel,"This apartment is a must-book! Patricia and Stéphane are incredibly gracious hosts and the apartment is beautiful. You can’t beat the location right by the metro station grocery store and so close to loads of great cafes bars restaurants you name it! There’s even a great beer shop right across the street for the harder to find products! But the best part is the apartment itself! So cute (including the courtyard) and quintessential French! It was blazing hot while we were in Paris this time but with the windows open throughout the apartment in the morning we got amazing airflow. And there are fans in the bedrooms for the hot times. The beds were comfortable and there was also a foldout couch if we had needed it.

Can’t say enough good things about this one would absolutely stay here again!"

1120552,482170652,2019-07-06,166247766,Andre,"Alice’s flat is absolutely wonderful and unusually spacious for a Parisian apartment. You’ll have to walk up a lot of stairs to get to it but it’s absolutely worth the effort for this loft apartment.

And the location is incredible as well—it’s in a quiet alley in the Latin Quarter. So while there’s a lot to do in the immediate area (cafes etc.) the alley protects you from any noise. 

With all of that said I highly recommend staying in Alice’s flat."

El emplazamiento es muy pintoresco el pasaje en el cual se emplaza el edificio te transporta a un momento especial del pasado de la vida urbana parisina casi como un oasis de paz entre el ajetreo de un barrio que tiene mucho para entregar como buenas tiendas espacios de dispersión y una vida bohemia bastante activa y animada. Por otra parte la persona que nos recibió fue muy amable y simpática en todo momento preocupada de hacer de nuestra estadía lo más cómodo no tuvimos problema alguno. Completamente recomendable.

4908402,244691517,2018-03-19,56440077,Silke,"Amazing cosy place in the heart of Montmarte just a few steps away from the Sacre Coeur. Bars and Restaurants everywhere and two metro stations close by. You are in the middle of the nightlife but because the house is located in the backyard it was amazingly quiet. 
The little house was very charming with a comfortable bed and a little kitchen equipped for cooking. The bathroom is a bit small but very clean with a good shower.

22668053,493787320,2019-07-23,207818515,Taylor,"I was staying in Paris for a few weeks for a work trip and the location of Naomi's place was very convenient (it's located about halfway between Châtelet/Les Halles and Rambuteau metros). The location is pretty central so it's perfect for first-time visitors to the city. It's a typical Parisien apartment--compact charming overlooking the main boulevard. The size was fine for just me but would have been a tight fit for multiple people.

Naomi is a very sweet person and responsive to messages. She was also flexible about check-in/check-out times which is convenient when you are traveling from long distances. 

Big plus is that the apartment has a washing machine!"

She left recommendations for me and made sure to check in on me as well during my time in Paris. The apartment is lovely and the views are fantastic. Hanna's cat is also a sweetheart. I enjoyed my stay and would recommend Hanna's place especially for women/girls traveling alone.
24768444,511123926,2019-08-17,46091785,Jen,Best hotel stay I’ve ever had in Paris. Modern rooms immaculately clean wonderful staff beautiful breakfast. Quiet street with easy access to the metro station Gaite (closest) or Montparnasse. They allow you to leave your luggage there if you arrive early. The rooms are small but that is what Paris is. They make the most of the space. The bathrooms were all modern and beautiful. I will definitely stay there again when I return.

Thanks for his generous giving to us like good red wine fresh orange juice special cocktail delicious pizza and handmade hot cocoa.

And the traffic advice he gave helped us to avoid wrong way to some place. Because many metro station closed from the river Seine flood. It was so sweet and considerate that he did for us.

Those restaurants he recommend were wonderful and perfect I miss those delicious food a lot. 

The host Olivier is very amiable to stay with and it's a good place that I recommend. :)"

Продолжается типичными парижскими улочками одна из которых - улица Коммерс - за 15 минут прогулочным шагом приведёт вас к Марсову полю. А заканчивается все прогулками по центру Парижа и осмотру его основных достопримечательностей. Если вы не ленитесь ходить и прогулки по Парижу для вас сродни походу в музей то вы сможете обойти все основные достопримечательности совсем не пользуясь транспортом. 
Натали - гостеприимная хозяйка с отличным чувством юмора готовая прийти на помощь по любому интересующем вас вопросу. 
Супермаркет если он вам понадобится находится за углом в 3 минутах ходьбы от дома. 
Кафе и рестораны а также множество магазинов - на улице Коммерс - в 1 минуте от дома.

18082111,247683384,2018-03-29,42140105,Monica,This space is placed in such a convenient location. It's a 5 minute walk to the train/metro station and a 15-20 minute walk to the Lourve. This airbnb spot was very aesthetic really clean and it was super easy to check in. It was a little noisy because the window is right along the main street but honestly it was not a problem. It definitely felt like you were in Paris! Other than that I highly recommend this place -- it's clean aesthetic and very accessible to everything. You're literally placed in the middle of everything!
31272631,419597885,2019-03-04,117538218,Jessica,Absolutely amazing for the price. You can’t beat it. The location was perfect very close to public transport but the street was nice and quiet. Everything was very clean and comfortable and worked well. Check in was a bit of a hassle as you have to go to a separate location nearby to pick up and drop off keys but other than that our stay was absolutely perfect. We would definitely stay again!

I highly recommend this place!"
12629202,404214710,2019-01-23,213552776,Danica,Amazing place to stay in it's on the top floor of the building so you have to walk six flights of stairs but this just adds to the authentic Parisian experience. It's very clean and Tom leaves you with a basket full of leaflets and information on where to go. He is very helpful and tells you good food places nearby too.

Also the flat was clean and had an equipped kitchen. I just found the sleeping situation complicated the foldable bed is not comfortable so I slept on the couch which was not what I expected but it worked for a short stay.
22859316,232762981,2018-02-06,166621317,Mariana,Our stay with Sabrina was excellent!!! First the location is great because the metro is 5 minutes away walking and plus you have a lot of stablishments like 2 blocks away (restos supermarket etc). The room is really big and cozy everything is clean and neat the kitchen is totally equiped and you can cook whatever you want. Sabrina and Kellou are great chefs and they cooked dinner for us which was so great and yummy. They really made us feel like home everything was perfect.

Near metro and there are a lot of restaurant near the house. 
If you have heavy and many luggage you can have some trouble with lifting them because of no elevator. 
I can understand because no elevator is normal in Paris ^^
But you can see wonderful view during your staying. 
I highly recommand."

We had all of the amenities that we needed. We found the area extremely safe and were delighted to find that it was located less than a minute away from Rue des Boulets an extremely useful metro line connecting us to the Champs Elysees and the Trocadero. The area also has many cafes supermarkets restaurants and bakeries. It's quiet at night aswell with very little traffic. Would highly recommend Camille's appartment with great hospitality and instant replies from the host!

The apartment is very light and architecturally interesting and has many great artworks by Corinne on the walls. It is quiet and in a great location. We had a fantastic time and would go back again. 
61459,247353284,2018-03-28,40940646,Zhidi,Stéphanie’s place was sweet and cute and had a really excellent location. It was close to Arc de Triomphe and the metro lines. Really convenient for travellers. Although the place was a bit small the range of items needed was complete and it fit two people to live very well.

The kitchen was quite functional and had all the items one needs to prep cook and clean. This place has had a lot of TLC and being in the heart of the Left Bank made it a perfect home base for exploring Paris.
18948066,449303838,2019-05-06,239458916,Christine,My husband and I have stayed in this apartment twice.  The location is great and it is large and comfortable by Paris standards.  You will have zero direct contact with the owner but he is very responsive to emails. You'll receive detailed instructions on where to pick up a key (about a 10 minute walk from the apartment) and must drop the key back upon your departure.  Be aware there is no elevator in the building and you are on the 4th floor (which the French call the 3rd floor!).  Overall a great place to enjoy your stay in fabulous Paris!

The space is big enough for two the shower was nice and the bed was comfortable. 
There are some interesting neighborhoods near by and the metro was a short walk away.
Kay was really pleasant to deal with and helpful with all of our questions. 
The only drawback was that a couple different locals warned us that the neighborhood was sketchy (but we had no problems and felt safe for the most part) and there was urine on the floor in the lobby for a couple days...
Overall we had an amazing time and were glad we choose to stay there.

517121,53931171,2015-11-14,7116753,Kristi,As a Chicago airbnb host who is here to attend the annual airbnb Open experiencing Marie's hospitality has been great. Marie is a superb host - communicating everything one needs to know about the apartment and the area. Her apartment is compact tastefully decorated and comfortable. It is situated close to the Metro and in a delightful neighborhood. To those who have issues with stairs be advised there are two flights - but what a find this is!
11855658,261226133,2018-05-06,8383581,Leonid,"The apartment is exactly what it is on pictures and the description (i.e. amazing location great restaurants within 100 meters good design) with a few very little caveats:
- There's quite a little noise. There are trash bins right outside of the apartment and you can hear everything from the outside. Also the toilet has 0 sound isolation from the room.
- The bathroom is extremely small - there isn't space to put any of your toilettries there
Overall the apartment is great. It is no luxury experience but everything works and is convenient."
526235,83240195,2016-07-02,5135098,Joe,Julien’s apartment was great and had everything you'd need. It was in a great location as well close to metro and buses but not in a very touristy area. I didn't get to meet Julien in person but he was very attentive and communication was incredibly easy. He also offered to book me a car to the airport which was very helpful. We had no problems with our visit and I would recommend staying here anytime.

29090666,440176296,2019-04-20,246457819,Cheryl,Audrey's place was beautiful and chic - exactly as pictured. She was very helpful throughout our stay and dropped us a call and someone to help when we encountered some problems with checking in initially. A great location and well stocked room definitely recommend this place to stay in Paris :)
18445845,182223205,2017-08-14,10314017,Constance,Audrey's apartment was absolutely delightful. It felt spacious serene and light-filled was very clean well equipped private and quiet and had a large and charming balcony. Audrey herself was great to communicate with - very fast and helpful when I couldn't figure out at first how to get wi-fi. The neighborhood is residential and quiet yet lively with many beautiful parks a small market below and many shops with anything you could need including an excellent artisanal boulangerie two doors down and a great cheese shop just across the street. There are several convenient metro stops and bus lines right nearby. I really can't say enough about how much I enjoyed staying here and I look forward to the next visit!

35207563,471318937,2019-06-17,189086042,Annika,"If you stay at Loup you have to climb 5 stairs and it is absolutley worth it. You will find such a friendly and helpful host and a sweet cat in a very cosy clean apartment. Due to that the location is extremly good. Cross the street and you find the metro. Byt due to location mång place are in walking distance. 
During summer you probably would like to sleep with an open window then we will recommend something to put in the ears to let the street noice out. We loved our stay at Loup!"
2773082,319036060,2018-09-05,38865600,Laura,This place is exactly as the pictures. Everything was very clean. Christophe was not available for us to check in and so he sent his friend Agnes. The location is amazing. The view is amazing. The bed is comfortable and the furnishings nice. Their are a ton of restaurants and bakeries in the neighborhood.

6928426,525666179,2019-09-08,72059946,Jessica,Romain’s place is pretty and charming in a lovely area. The flat is clean and vintage style. The only thing that could be made better was the padlock opening for the key as it was slightly difficult to figure out! Other than that communication was clear and easy.
5029201,212794455,2017-11-19,155415668,Tara,Besides the absolutely beautiful home at a very historical yet lively location in Paris Eric was very understanding of our situation upon arrival (we went to Paris to surprise our grandmother for her birthday dinner) and he accommodate us perfectly so that we got to enjoy our evening with our family before heading to the house for our check-in. He welcomed us very warmly and offered his sincere help during our stay should we need it. We truly hope that when we’re in Paris the next time we get the privilege and chance to stay at Eric’s place again! If you’re headed to Paris and want to truly feel the essence of Paris we highly recommend Eric’s house! You will not regret it!

361133,37185905,2015-07-05,16868736,Julie,"L'appartement est bien situé à 2 min à pied du lycée Henri IV et du quartier Mouffetard/contrescarpe.
Si vous cherchez un logement à deux pas des lieux branchés cet appartement est ce qu'il vous faut. Parcontre il ne faut pas avoir le sommeil trop léger car le quartier est très vivant et donc plutôt bruyant... 
Niveau propreté les lits étaient prêts (draps propres) des serviettes propres étaient à notre disposition (3 serviettes et 3 draps de bain). A noter quand même que la poussière et les toiles d'araignées étaient encore bien présentes sans parler de la peinture de la cuisine qui s'effrite sérieusement...
La salle de bain est quant à elle fonctionnelle et propre."
10810009,240218912,2018-03-04,64723236,Mi,I love Marie's apartment. It is nice and cosy. I stayed 2 months in this apartment and I had a great time. The area is perfect for exploring Paris and it is really safe there. The furniture is french-chic-style which I love really much. Marie is a nice person and we had a great time together. I can really recommend to stay at Marie's place.
566511,4049468,2013-04-06,2303563,Amelia,Can't think of any complaints. The host: a warm Parisien. The room: a cozy spot to explore Paris. I stayed 7 nights and slept very well. Photos show it all and more (it is in Marais safe and easy to go anywhere). Marie speaks fluent English so it is great for a non-French speaking traveler. She shared her favorite bar witty notes and classic French food with me. Thanks for Marie she kindly took care of me while I had a cold and fever. I got better and carried on my trip. Also appreciate the flexibility with arrival and leaving time. She even set up an account in her PC for guests. Marie showed me a Parisien morning right before I went to  CDG airport. What a great time :)
20617849,197327670,2017-09-25,95473720,Jack,Staying in Daniel's home was a truly wonderful experience! It is in an amazing neighborhood the is extremely central and hip.

The apartment itself is a beautiful little place and we throughly enjoyed staying there during fashion week. Thanks again Marie 
35419412,478028712,2019-06-29,122849306,Caitlin,This place was great! Lovely old (heritage listed?) building but new interior. Everything was super clean. Expect lots of stairs which were a bit tiring to get up with our suitcases but nothing unmanageable for a reasonably able person. The nespresso machine was a welcome touch which we used every morning. We were there during a legitimate heat wave with temperatures of 36 degrees C so it was really warm in this apartment being on the top floor with no air conditioning but there are tonnes of windows throughout this apartment and once the place was opened up it was fine. Fabulous location. Loved it - thank you!

38248408,533828097,2019-09-22,138191848,Theresa,For us Florence’s apartment was a great find.  We thought her updated place retained an old-Paris style that we enjoyed.  Florence’s personal recommendations for local restaurants and shopping were very helpful. The apartment was well located for us to zip around Paris on the metro. We would happily return.
908363,269241575,2018-05-27,20336489,Viki,The location was perfect - close to park and Bvd Saint Michel etc for walking Metro for getting to other sites taxi rank when leaving with large suitcase. Fall out front door and into cafe loads of lovely restaurants very close - perfect spot for Paris stay. Noisy at night but suspect that would apply to many places - the French do love their sirens.
25174723,289306395,2018-07-12,23759281,Kathryn,Pascale's flat is great! It is spacious well equipped and conveniently located near a metro stop. She also went the extra mile by providing us with recommendations for the area coffee and juice in the morning and maps of the area. She was also very friendly. We would definitely recommend staying at Pascale's apartment.
530288,445859284,2019-04-30,222477534,Miranda,I had a great two night stay at this apartment. The location is fantastic! It's walking distance to tourist sites restaurants and shops. It's right across the street from the metro and surprisingly quiet. The bathroom is a bit small but the overall experience and location is great for the price!

24850611,557504417,2019-11-01,214091878,Wallace,This is a comfortable and stylish apartment in an excellent location in Paris. It is right across the street from a Metro stop and is a walk away from the heart of Montmatre. The building is safe and secure and the balcony (with a view of the Eiffel Tower) is an added bonus. Vanessa was very helpful communicated in a timely fashion and was there to greet us and explain the finer details about the apartment when we arrived. We highly recommend this apartment. Great value.

She also had a bottle of water and champagne read for us nespresso capsules dishwasher soap garbage bags things that made the difference after our long flight. 
There were three metro station just blocks away and the neighborhood is lovely. Lots of grocery stores a monoprix (big supermarket) very close 24hrs drugstore boulangeries restaurants and all kinds of shops including Sephora M.A.C and Kiehl´s.
We loved Jocelyne´s place and already indicated to our friends with children. Hope to be back sometime soon merci beaucoup!

23497302,306132221,2018-08-12,35788862,Maya,The room was small but clean and well maintained. Unfortunately we got a room where the window just faced a wall (we had read some other reviews about this so it wasn't a total shock to us). It's not the kind of room you would want to spend a lot of time in and we only really returned to sleep so it was OK. The room was a lot hotter than the outside temperature and they had given a fan to help with that so it was bearable but air conditioning or a better-ventilated window would have made things a whole lot better. Breakfast was a simple fare with basic necessities. The host and other service were polite and friendly. The location is probably the biggest plus of this hotel with lots of popular restaurants around and open till quite late into the night. 
13610872,108948868,2016-10-18,79667051,Philip,This is a great place to stay.  So accessible to the subway.  And the subway line is the main line across town so accessible to all other lines pretty easily.  Walking distance to main tourist area like the Louvre.  Several nice restaurants nearby.  Studio apt was updated and well maintained.  Like most places not for those that can't climb stairs.  In summer may be warm as no AC but for cooler months would gladly stay here again.

1470378,283510961,2018-06-30,45950625,Vanessa,"Bertrand's place is the real Paris experience. It is a very ""Parisian"" apartment classy charming and at the center of the very upscale 16ieme arrondissement close to the center yet away from too many tourists and noise. The apartment is very well located and calm yet very close to many shops and the metro. It is literally 2 mn walking distance to the closest supermarket boulangerie bus station metro parc (Bois de Boulogne) etc. The little garden is heaven and you won't find many of those in Paris. Bertrand and his mother were wonderful and very flexible with us. They both speak perfect English which is very useful. I cannot think of a better place to stay in Paris and get a sense of the real Parisian experience."

There were shampoo soap shower cap and so on. It was like an hotel big plus!

Nous avons juste eu le problème du ménage qui n'a pas été fait par le bnbsitter et avons du retardé l'entrée dans l'appartement. Le ménage à été très mal fait par le bnbsitter.

Nous n'avons pas rencontré Yassmine mais elle a été très disponible pour nous aider.

Son appartement est très agréable bien équipé lumineux et au calme.
Mon oncle et ma tante on beaucoup apprécié leur séjour.

Je recommande vivement son logement.

Merci beaucoup Yassmine de les avoir accueilli chez vous.

Bien cordialement

2860869,424685274,2019-03-17,60998042,Anthony,Marine’s place was perfect for my short stay in Paris. I’m in town for work about 4 times a year (bragging) and try a different arrondissement every visit. This time was the Latin Quarter. It’s a great neighborhood. Very lively tons to do and see. It is a little younger than the rest of Paris. Folks in their early 20s. So it can get loud and rowdy at night. There was a party in the building the weekend I was there for instance. But that’s just what you get with a big city. If you’re looking for a lovely weekend away from some of the more touristy parts of Paris this place is a must stay.
13344259,335476776,2018-10-12,60759593,Juana,The apartment was ok. Very well located in Paris. Host was late 3 hours in the check in  and did not allow us a late check out.

566511,2870968,2012-11-12,2755990,Cameron,Fantastic deal. Marie's flat is located right in the heart of le Marais which is quite possibly my favourite neighbourhood in all of Paris. The bed is a simple mattress on the floor behind the sofa but this was totally fine for my needs. I only spent two nights but wish I had discovered her place earlier. I would have been happy to spend my entire 3 weeks in Paris at Marie's. Unfortunately I did not get to meet her in person but she replied quickly and left detailed directions etc. for me. I was greeted by one of her friends who was looking after the flat while she was away. He was very friendly.

Ev fotoğraftaki kadar süper değildi. Ama kötü de değildi. Mahalle biraz insanı ürkütebilir fakat geç saatte de eve geldik hiçbir sorun yaşamadık. Yakınlarda güzel helal fırın restaurant vb. şeyler bulabilirsiniz.

7299412,41507977,2015-08-07,40072233,Dan,Great location for what we did that day that's it... the bad? the key doesn't fit properly requires 5-15 minutes to open the door the first time and a secret handshake you have to figure out. Shower is small with no place to put your bath supplies. Hand towels were supplied to dry the body. wifi was a 3g hotspot which takes Internet speeds back to the 90's barely worked too. And the AC unit did not turn on if the box by the window was even the AC but whatever it was it didn't function... luckily keeping the window open sufficed. And I'm not 100% sure the sheets were clean. Also noisy Inside the building when other apt dwellers vacate in the morning.  Would not go back.

11848,40368995,2015-07-30,997000,Céline,The apartment was easy to find thanks to very precise directions. His representative waited for us in front of the building and carried our heavy suitcases to the third floor. The studio is spotless and cozy. The kitchen is fully equipped - and even better he left us snacks that we were free to eat. We felt extremely welcomed. The representative made some insightful suggestions on how best to explore Paris and was very accommodating. Thanks to his freebox we were able to make calls to the United States.  We will be back at Thierry's place in no time. 
12697707,449216963,2019-05-06,256034914,Dawid,The host is very nice and hospitable person. Very good communication and nice cosy flat in french style :) Localization is very good - two metro stations nearby.
5295413,264873854,2018-05-15,188868745,Tom,"I was visiting Paris for a few days and everything was arranged at quite short notice so I was glad to find a place in a great location. It’s a very quiet street especially given how close you are to the Eiffel Tower and Les Invalides.

Apartment was perfectly clean and is just like the pictures. Check in was very easy and SL!M was in touch with me regularly which helped because my flight was delayed. 

I didn’t spend too much time in the apartment as I was travelling a lot so can’t say too much about it but everything was perfect for what I needed. My friend slept on the sofa bed and said it was very comfortable."

The area is perfect for going out with lots of nice restaurants and bars on your door step. We would highly recommend Gaspard's apartment and look forward to staying here again.
29699690,426215777,2019-03-20,20403988,Beth,The place is big and lovely and the location was great.  One of the showers didn’t drain so it flooded the bathroom but Annie explained she was having it fixed. There weren’t any recommendations/tips/ info on necessities which may not be an issue for others but it would have been nice to have.
1140610,176556537,2017-07-31,7649346,Camilla,We had a great stay in Gregory's flat. The location was great - quiet but still very central and really nice area. The flat was small but nice and had all necessary amenities. Only downside was the fan in the bathroom which was on a timer and was quite loud when it was on during the day and a damp smell. Generally a really positive experience and I would recommend this place.

274590,50072314,2015-10-09,6523872,Oliver,"I travel to Paris for business at least 2 times a year and always rent an apartment. Of all the apartments I've rented this has been my favorite.  The apartment is spacious and spread out and has nice light comfortable furniture and a practical layout. There is a nice formal dining room a very functional living room and nice balcony. Its location can hardly be beat as you can throw a rock and hit Palais Royal on one side the Louvre on the other. Opera is a few blocks away Grand boulevards behind it and Rue Honore Place Vendome are just blocks away. Also Metro lines 1 and 9 nearby will take you almost anywhere you'd want to go. The immediate area around the apartment is a petite ""Japantown"" with delicious and cheap Japanese food for when you need a break from French fare.  I was met by the owners mother who was kind and helpful in explaining the basics. The  owner who is obviously well traveled has plenty of books on Paris and has printed out helpful information packets for all your Parisian needs.  Wether you are there as a tourists or for business a day around Paris can be exhausting and I was always happy to come back to the apartment to relax and decompress from my busy day. There is surprisingly little noise from the street below in the front bedroom and the back is a full on cave where you might sleep for a whole week so set your alarm. The kitchen is basic but well appointed with an automatic coffee machine of which I did drink all the coffee there so I do apologize for that.  There are great patisseries and epiceries nearby but not on the immediate street because its a Japanese neighborhood but a block or 2 aways wonders await. This is a comfortable apartment that should meet the needs of most who want to live like a Parisian. I recommend it for 2 couples a threesome or just a pair of lovers on a romantic getaway.  Also the firemen down the block never turn on their sirens on the street and they dress in the cutest little shorts!  "
4409034,53368627,2015-11-08,39504835,Laure,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans l'appartement d'Elodie (2 nuits). Elodie était là pour nous accueillir chaleureusement et nous présenter son appartement plein de charme. Tout était propre et soigné pour notre arrivée. Nous avons pu bénéficier de linge de lit et de toilette très propres et de boissons fraîches. La vue sur le Sacré Coeur est splendide et ajoute un immense caché à ce très joli et confortable appartement.
Le quartier est sympathique possibilité de prendre également un petit déjeuner ou brunch aux alentours et l'appartement est situé à deux pas du Sacré Coeur et de la salle de spectacle du Trianon.
Nous n'hésiterons pas à recontacter Elodie si nous avons de nouveau besoin d'un logement pour un éventuel prochain week-end parisien."

We enjoyed walking around the area during the day and night... the metro station is right around the corner and there is a boulangerie supermarket and restaurants all in the same street. Very centric and easy to access. When arriving at the apartment we couldn’t stop complementing how extremely clean everything was. The apartment had all the amenities we needed and more! We will definitely recommend this listing to all our friends. During our stay we fell in love with this place and already can’t wait to be back in Paris. Merci beaucoup Alexandra!!!!!

Valeries Wohnung liegt in einem wunderschönen Viertel zwar nahe der Sacre Coeur jedoch sind dort keine Touristen. Die Metro Station ist 3 Minuten entfernt es gibt tolle Geschäfte Bars und Restaurants. Die Wohnung ist gut ausgestattet und für uns gerade noch groß genug. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und würden jederzeit wieder dorthin gehen.

12336375,149040358,2017-05-02,39120506,Jenna,My husband and I absolutely loved staying here during our short stay in Paris! It's a short walk to the Sacred Heart Cathedral where you have an outstanding hilltop view of all of Paris. We also walked to all of the main tourist spots from here and found it quite pleasant. It's a bit of a hike if you're not fond of walking but you're close to the Metro and can get around easy if you prefer. Michele & Herve go all out providing breakfast outside your door each morning as well as a private entrance to your room which was very nice as we were home late each evening. Overall we loved our stay the only thing to note is that much of the flat smells like cigarette smoke however there is not a single trace of it in the bedroom. We are not smokers ourselves and it didn't really bother us however if you're really sensitive you may be bothered. Then again it is Paris so you might find that to be common!
20166588,546862626,2019-10-14,120724868,Nicole,This apartment is great for young people visiting Paris.  The neighborhood was amazing. Not touristy at all. The apartment was a bit cramped for me and my daughters. It was my fault for not reading the post thoroughly.  Virgine was great and very easy to communicate with.  The five flights are serious. We didn’t mind but someone with mobility issues might find it too taxing. All in all it was great for our stay.

위치 좋고 방 넓고 방 안에 네스프레소도 있어서 커피 마실 수 있어요.
제일 좋은 점은 방에 화장실이 따로 있어서 다른 분들과 쉐어 안 하시고 
언제든 쓰실 수 있어요 :) 호스트도 좋고요 영국 아저씨라 불어 모르셔도 소통가능해요. 

这是很好的房子｡房子很大位置很好｡
最好处是这房子里面有卫生间不需要跟别人一起用｡
房东也很好他是英国人所以你不说法语也没问题｡

Her apartment is in an excellent location in Paris only one block from a Metro station and in front of a rent a bike spot. If you like to walk in only 3 km you are near Paris major touristic points like Notre Dame Cathedral. 
It`s definitely a great choice to stay at Blanca's place! Hope to come back there soon!"

Fan wasn’t great and no sheet just a thick blanket. You could open a window but then it was really noisy! We got very little sleep which was annoying! 

Wish I could be more more positive."
19537700,184680235,2017-08-20,36331332,Chantal Jochemina,Nice appartment in a great location in Paris. Check-in and check-out was through an air-bnb house sitting service which was okay-ish luckily Juliette was quick to respond when we had questions about WIFI. Note that we were asked to provide the extra 29 euro after our accepted booking and payment when the cleaning service turned out to be more expensive than expected. Myself I would not have asked this after extra payment from the person renting but I agreed to it anyway cause I did not want to cancel my booking and look for another place again. Overall a good option for your stay in Paris though.

Stephane is a great host and was quick to respond to all our queries. The house has been tastefully done few steps away from metro lines. The sound and light system is one of its kind in all the rooms and we really enjoyed using it. Stephane arranged comfortable taxis with well mannered chauffeurs for us on request which was a great help. The new sofa beds were really comfortable and were perfect for our family of 5 adults. We definitely recommend staying at his beautiful house :)"

As this was my first time using Airbnb I wasn't too sure what to expect. I can highly recommend Guta as a hostess and this apartment in particular. And I would have no hesitation to book accommodation through Airbnb another time. "

39143637,547427099,2019-10-15,12969432,Liam,Alexis's apartment is centrally located in a charming Paris neighborhood.  And he was able to communicate with us at the last minute so that we could check in a little bit earlier than originally planned.
1901797,88847347,2016-07-25,55818465,Claire,"The apartment is as the pictures show - very comfortable and plenty of room for one or two people (my boyfriend and I were there for a month). However there was very loud construction (clanging drills workman's music etc.) in the courtyard of the building that began every week morning at around 730am and continued until late afternoon. Additionally there are some very loud neighbors in this complex who have conversations/arguments at all hours with their windows open. We ended up needing to close all of the windows and shutters even when it was very hot and stuffy... and this still did not block out all of their noise. I have stayed in many apartments in the greater Montmartre area and would stay at all of them again - however the noise in this apartment would prevent me from staying here again. 

All of that said the apartment itself is in good condition and everything works (including the clothes washer). We cooked often in the apartment and really appreciated the kitchen amenities (including herbs and spices and some soups and pastas) Heloise provided. "

The apartment is blocks away from the some of Paris’s most incredible museums and restaurants. Not only was the furniture modern and clean the apartment felt very safe.

30204504,480689658,2019-07-03,12835280,Malia,Siri’s place is in a very convenient location just steps away from the Olympiades stop and very close by metro to Gare de Lyon. It also has a lift which was helpful. The place is clean and I felt safe with the others staying there. My only complaint would be with the noise and heat at night. I was there after the heat wave but still the room was quite warm unless the window was completely open and unfortunately the plaza below was pretty loud. One night there was a band or karaoke playing at a restaurant until past midnight. A fan in the room would have helped with both the heat and the noise. Otherwise the stay was nice and Siri was a kind host.

8199688,152206141,2017-05-15,79077731,Grainne,"Claire's apartment is amazing and very big. There are three double rooms on one side of the apartment with proper double beds. The fourth bedroom consists of a pull out couch which we didn't need to usebut which was great playroom for the kids. There is a great sitting room with a full dining table and chairs which made eating in and cooking easy. The kitchen is small but perfectly sufficient.  There is two toilets but just one shower which was fine for us. We were a group of 6  my husband and I two toddlers and my parents. 
The location is great and just opposite the botanical gardens. 
Claire was very accommodating  she organised two travel cots for us as well as car parking. Her lovely mother let us into the apartment and showed us around. One thing I would note  is that if you are bringing babies and wish to use the fourth bedroom bring a baby monitor as you will not hear the baby from the other bedrooms on the other side of the apartment. 
All on all Claire and her apartment were excellent and I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Paris. Thank you Claire"
33413663,540285614,2019-10-03,26438079,Don,While the cleaning did not meet the standard we found in our other bookings we still enjoyed this apartment very much. The furniture was comfortable the bed was very comfortable and the shower was great. While the street is a busy noisy one the bedroom faces an inner courtyard so noise was not an issue.  It is well located with lots of restaurants and food and wine shops nearby. It was about a 3km walk to the Eiffel Tower and bus stops and a metro station nearby.

1370563,253320238,2018-04-14,69021482,Jason,Had a wonderful time at Theo's apartment.  The apartment is clean and comfortable.  Average size for a Paris apartment but it's located in a wonderful area.  So close to the Blanche metro stop which connected us all over the city.  Theo was very helpful with ideas and resources.  The apartment is located on the top floor of an 1850's Haussman style building with no elevator.  Theo carried all of our heavy luggage up the stairs.  I highly recommend staying at this apartment.
534650,283520635,2018-06-30,167040191,Annette,The apartment was spacious and very secure with two outer doors. Rather quirky layout with one bed at a raised level. The location was very good not far from Gare du Nord station and within walking distance of the Seine and Notre Dame. Nice to have a few games to play and the torch was useful for the occupant of the upper bunk (to avoid waking those below).
31729508,543162955,2019-10-07,211321371,Arthur,Michel’s apartment was a great place to stay during my long trip to Paris. Located in Le Marais a very hip area there were a lot of cool cafes and bistros very close by. It was a perfect starting point for my travels throughout the city each day. I would definitely stay here again.
10016909,200181239,2017-10-04,61558656,Ellen,"Barbara is a wonderful hostess. Generous and hospitable. Her instructions are perfect and her recommendations of restaurants and things to do spot on. 
The apartment location is the best. Quiet street off of a lively fun area. The garbage pick up in the mornings can be a little loud but after one day we were used to it. 
The architecture and art work (her father’s) are both inspiring. And everything works!  I would not hesitate to stay a moment to stay at Barbara’s home again."
756458,81074063,2016-06-20,25279168,Amy,We had a wonderful stay at Elisabeth's warm house. The house is 5mins away from the subway so it was very convenient getting around the city. Both Elisabeth and Joy were also very helpful in giving us directions and tips to get around. I would definitely like to come back here when I come to Paris.
13558212,105075522,2016-09-30,1815278,Farhana,Wonderful apartment cosy but quite spacious. Lovely secure location only 4 mins walk from Paris motor show location. Flat is clean and tidy and the owner has very thoughtfully included so many items in the cupboards you may need. A real gem!
14856048,504629926,2019-08-08,114330054,Sally,Great flat host really good at letting us know that there would be work going on at the building before we arrived.
503569,4245961,2013-04-22,5186669,Nicholas,I had a nice time staying here. Comfortable good sized room and Christophe was very helpful. Kind of a sleepy neighborhood but close walking distance to many of the sights. Especially convenient to Rue Mouffetard for cheap eats and Jardin du Luxembourg for strolling and people watching.
7260466,331674381,2018-10-03,200842393,Natalia,La habitación es exageradamente pequeña no hay espacio para las cosas básicas como ubicar las maletas ropa etc. El baño es muy pequeño e incómodo al punto de dificultar la utilización del mismo las paredes son sucias y tienen un evidente deterioro el sofá cama es incómodo y ruidoso además que las sabanas estaban sucias y cuando se le preguntó al anfitrión contestó de una manera grosera la ubicación es muy buena y fácil de llegar.

The location is grrat if you want the real Parisian feel with not so many tourists and yet really close to many attractions. The place was comfortable and quiet and close to many of our favorite restaurants. This place is a great value for money and I highly recommend it. We'll definitely stay there if we are in Paris again.

首先很感谢房东的接待把这么好的房子提供给我们让巴黎的行程更加完美｡房子真的很棒和图片一模一样无论是整体还是细节都很精致我特别特别喜欢这样的装修风格｡
房子的地理位置很赞从地铁站出来只需要步行2min走到凯旋门也只要7min左右｡并且离很多公交站很近公交的线路可以很方便的到埃菲尔铁塔塞纳河沿岸等｡
房子周围生活很方便各种餐馆(法餐日餐中餐bar都有)超市都应有尽有并且我发现楼下超市的矿泉水价格很划算勒!
房间里提供了几乎一切生活所需要的东西十分干净整洁｡我很喜欢楼上的卧室可以仰望星空可以享受阳光｡
整个房子确实如Catherine所描述保持了原生态的同时采用现代科技让房间的居住更舒服比如楼上的电动遮阳比如垃圾桶比如强有力的电吹风都很棒｡
最后还特别喜欢房东提供的音乐让我爱上了法国音乐真美｡"

17918679,369363806,2019-01-10,9459724,Carol,This is a lovely apartment in the heart of Montmartre. Fantastic location near to cafes & restaurants and a couple of grocery stores. We are a family of four with two young children and we fitted comfortably in this apartment. The eat-in kitchen was particularly impressive size-wise! Our interactions with the host and her representatives were efficient and cordial. Overall I would thoroughly recommend this place.
36824236,529010767,2019-09-14,36094447,Kiya,It is equipped with a coffee machine and a washing machine. For spending several days in Paris Gaëlle’s house is worthy of staying. I recommend!

The room is clean and the kitchen large. Javier is a nice and cool host he respected my privacy and gave some goog advice when I needen one. Thanks Javier :)

The host gave it a lovely X-mas touch for the holiday season.
Smooth communication and warm welcome."
13104420,454013488,2019-05-17,226125191,규림,Location is really good. Subway and bus stations are close. Kitchen is really practical and bath room is little bit small but clean. However you have to move your luggage to the 4th floor without elevator and the steps are really narrow and steep. Also when i was staying ants came out and we couldnt ignore because too many ants came out. 위치는 정말좋은편입니다. 근처 바랑도 가깝고 음식점도 주변에 많아요! 근데 일단 개뮈가 나오구요..그것두 아주 무ㅐ니..그리고 사 층인뒈 계돤이 너뮤 가퐈르고 좁아숴 캐리워 무거우쉰 분드룬 고려를 해보시길 바뤠요.
10514296,339295162,2018-10-21,17355187,Thomas,Wir waren 6 Personen ( 2 Erwachsene und vier Kinder) im Apartment von François. François hat uns persönlich begrüßt uns alles sehr gut erklärt und ein paar Tipps gegeben. Das Apartment war sauber und gut eingerichtet. Wir hatten genügend Platz und haben uns wohl gefühlt. Das Apartment liegt sehr gut gelegen sodass wir alles schnell erreichen konnten (Metro Bus Bahn). Gleich eine Straße weiter liegt das Viertel um den Canal St. Martin wo es jede Menge Cafes und Restaurants gibt. Für unser langes Wochenende in Paris genau richtig.
8569158,437160489,2019-04-14,49155782,Danny,Amazing place located on an amazing spot. You are close to all fancy neighbourhoods (especially Le Marais). The place is in a quiet street and suited on the ground floor. 10/10 would recommend.
1005600,22301047,2014-11-03,20915856,Mikela,My parents and I thoroughly enjoyed Michelle's apartment for a week in Paris. The advertisement was very accurate and the apartment was very clean. Fit 3 people perfectly and could fit 4 as well. There was an excellent restaurant right at the bottom of the building that we went to numerous nights. The apartment is on the 4th floor so keep that in mind if you have elderly people in your group. The neighborhood was perfect for getting to all the main attractions in Paris. We walked a lot but the metro was also very easily accessible. Highly recommend!
15843227,249601425,2018-04-02,40983028,Þóra,Latedj’s apartment is amazing!! Perfect location and very cozy to relax in after long days exploring the city. I highly recommend it!

22605312,247672051,2018-03-29,102776807,Adena Shea,Perfect location and perfect space. Maxime was very nice! I would definitely stay here again!!!
21819678,236448602,2018-02-19,32174043,Christopher,"Let me start with saying overall Pascal's place was comfortable and cute. The location is between 3 metro stations a few grocery stores and near lots of nice restaurants in the area! Pascal and the greeting people were very lovely and check in/out was easy. The view was absolutely breathtaking and accounts for a lot of positive feedback too a full panoramic rooftop view of Paris with the Tour d'Eiffel le Pantheon Sacre Coeur and even a peak of a few churches were stunning. 

Unfortunately however - this place felt a lot like a commercial self service apartment and not very much an AirBnB filled with love and care and was missing a few basic essentials.

The windows were single glazed and so it was very noisy across the road from a school and with lots of traffic (but that's Paris!) - so we just popped the TV on and watched the snow fall on the balcony. The was missing lots of things: only 1 wine glass a broken wine bottle opener no sharp knives to cook with whatsoever nothing for breakfasts be it bread/croissants/milk or no sugar for coffees that a lot of AirBnB's provide no washing powder for washing machine the mattress on the pullout couch sofa bed was very thin the pillows were filled with cheap and lumpy filling and the bed creaked consistently at night making it very hard to sleep well. A few lights didn't work in the living room and bathroom areas also. A lot of the cutlery and plates were mostly dirty in the cupboards and we had to wash everything we took out before using it. There was a lack of enough toiletries for a 1 week stay (only 2 20ml bottles of shampoo and 2 small bars of soap). In the living room the Freebox was locked out from streaming our own personal content or Netflix accounts and unfortunately the poor bed and pillows make it hard to be good value for nearly $200AUD a night.

Overall we were comfortable but there's a few things missing and you must bring a lot of your own stuff to make this place work like a home away from home."

19827659,533174319,2019-09-21,271771884,Kath,Beautiful apartment which fitted our family of 6 perfectly. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of storage space. The location is brilliant so close to 2 metro lines with major sights just a few stops away and a bakery selling amazing croissants a couple of doors down and a general store just across the street.

1010590,442687368,2019-04-24,34961647,Manoj,Our stay at this apartment was quite good. The apartment is old but good & clean. Few doors are a bit difficult to lock or open but those are manageable. The amenities were excellent. You will find lot of things at kitchen those are essential for cooking like salt oil peeper etc.  Overall nice apartment with an excellent connectivity to all the places.
25821219,307358701,2018-08-14,82466041,Olivia,Perfect place for a few days in Paris. Spacious and clean modern lovely apartment. We had so much fun and appreciated the thoughtful touches like tea and breakfast. Would highly recommend!

61459,62661306,2016-02-15,9634707,Erica,Stephanie's flat was just perfect for my quick trip to Paris! It was very clean cozy and just a five mins walk to the metro station. I made the walk back at night and felt perfectly safe. There are cafes on each corner literally about 10 steps away. Stephanie responded quickly and even helped me get checked in early. I had a delightful trip and lovely place to stay thanks to Stephanie who was quick to respond! 
21675570,225399284,2018-01-06,87813991,Manolo,Hemos estado 5 días en París.  La estancia en el apartamento nos lo ha facilitado todo: muy limpio buena ubicación en uno de los barrios más atractivos de París y un lugar silencioso para descansar equipado con todo lo necesario: electrodomésticos para preparar desayuno comida y cena; calefacción; con una decoración moderna y con mucho gusto.  Claire es una gran anfitriona muy atenta en nuestras demandas con una respuesta rápida y propuestas prácticas.  Sin duda si volvemos a París nos gustaría repetir la estancia en el apartamento de Claire en Montmartre.

She was able to accommodate our late check in at 10.30pm and gave us plenty of information on how to get to the apartment and lots of helpful info on the area including some restaurant and bar suggestions. The apartment was perfect for our stay in a very central location! Couldn't have asked for a better experience!! Highly recommend.
899959,252774645,2018-04-12,57359122,Cyril,Tres bonne adresse dans un quartier populaire hors de la foule touristique. Metro a 2 pas. Accueil chaleureux. Courrez y si vous sejournez a Paris.
3393864,308931315,2018-08-17,93433574,Ciprian,The apartament is very well located 5 minutes away from Louvre or Seine it is clean and beautiful but the area where it is located is very nosy garbage collection every morning at 6:30 (guess how I know) the windows are good quality sound proof but if you close them up the flat will get really hot so there is a no win-no win situation. It could do with some things that the tourists are not buying such as oil or pepper maybe some towels as the flat is dotated with washing machine so cleaning them up should not be a problem. Maud wasn’t the warmest host ever no text to see if I checked in or checked out.  Overall the flat is a 4**** experience. Cheers

So friendly kind quick to communicate meet us at a time we requested (thank you) and was so sweet to tell us places to visit. Best host ever. The location of the apartment couldn't be better. 2 minutes to the Louvre tons of restaurants and shops. Another plus we loved was an actual bed not a pull out. We highly recommend working with Marion.

1313931,437813835,2019-04-15,15607677,Pamela,A beautiful apartment in a convenient location. We loved our week-long stay but had an unpleasant experience with Ines when I asked for an extra towel so that we could change our towels mid-week (there were 3 provided). Instead of simply saying that she did not have anymore available she called the apartment at 11:45 PM awakening my husband and yelled at me for five minutes about the audacity of my request. Many reviews speak of how helpful she is and I think she probably is full of great suggestions about the area and knowledge about Paris. Nonetheless we had a wonderful 30th anniversary stay in this very pretty apartment.
9657054,72477078,2016-05-02,46146314,Goni,"We were absolutely pleased with our stay in Junnan's apartment. The apartment is designed nicely it's neat and cosy. The location is excellent and very comfortable to get around. Junnan was a terrific host that helped us with every request or question we had.

Very gracious and humble young man who made our stay flawless.  This was my first experience with abnb and it was a phenomenal one with great value. I would have had to pay double the amount for my family of 9 had we stayed in a hotel. Thx Lorenzo.

Perfect location between Oberkampf and Le Marais - easy access to all of the bars restaurants and shopping of both areas. 5 min walk to the metro. Apartment is beautifully decorated with so much attention to detail and interesting design touches - cozy quiet and perfect to come home to after a long day or night in the city.

He was also kind enough to provide us with a pocket wi-fi as the internet wasn't working. This was all pre-arranged and ready for us on our arrival. 
Clement was very considerate and provided us with a lot of local knowledge and even a map.
The apartment was a little smaller than I anticipated but it is Paris after all and very well located. We had 3 beds and all slept well. Perfect for a family with 2 children who need a good sleep after a day of sightseeing. Thanks again!"

6234587,65936009,2016-03-18,22975002,Samantha,"Zusammengefasst:
- super organisiert
- Yankel war jederzeit erreichbar
- Nachbarschaft sehr sicher mit super Bars (Lockwood Mabel) und genialen Restaurants!
- zwei Metro-Stationen und eine Marktstraße in unmittelbarer Nähe 
- Wohnung befindet sich im 3. Stock ohne Aufzug und das Treppenhaus ist relativ schmal
- Wohnung ist super ausgestattet
- einziger großer Minuspunkt: die Wohnung ist sehr feucht was man auch direkt riecht wenn man reinkommt. Vermutlich ist dies auch normal für diese Art von Pariser Altbauten. 
Nach kurzem Lüften geht es zwar allerdings kommt der Geruch schnell wieder. Unter dem einen Fenster hat sich allerdings schon schwarzer Schimmel gesammelt. Zwar entfernt und übergestrichen kann man leider auch den Schimmel hinter den Schränken und der Küche erahnen weshalb ich lediglich einen Aufenthalt von ein paar Tagen empfehlen würde."

Its an unusual apartment as its in a converted garage which would give excellent access if one your party wad disabled - thought that worth mentioning."

The two-story windows filled the space with natural light and the sleeping spaces were perfect for the two of us plus an additional friend one evening.  The two bathrooms were sumptuous by Parisian standards and made our stay feel so luxurious.  There is a large soaking tub in one and a really beautiful shower in the other.  
What a special and unique place to have the privilege to call Home for a few nights in Paris."

Il est très fonctionnel calme lumineux avec une jolie vue sur les jardins de sciences po et on peut également apercevoir la Tour Eiffel. Très propre une literie de qualité une cafetière Nespresso il n'y a absolument rien à reprocher à cette appartement. Les toilettes sont sur le palier mais ça ne doit pas vous freiner.

27055514,535351931,2019-09-24,54453900,Susanne,Great location yet very quiet (apart from the school yard noise nearby in the morning) a charming place with lots of character a generous host who lets you stay in his place with so many personal objects in it. Very good and prompt communication with Pierre-Henry who was very flexible with the check-in time. Can fully recommend it for people who like a place with character rather than standard accommodation.

The location is great too - very close to the Stalingrad metro station that takes you to the city center. Hervé is a great host - he replied immediately to all of our queries and waited for us late into the evening for a smooth check-in. Definitely recommend!
996171,142724489,2017-04-09,62486753,Nate,"Great apartment in an fantastic location! Bali is amazing and the check-in process was flawless. You really couldn't ask for a better location in one of the best neighborhoods in Paris. 

A few considerations - the water pressure in the shower is very low. The beds are not super comfortable. The master bed has a noticeable dip on one side and the twin beds are quite stiff. 

That said we enjoyed our visit and would absolutely stay here again in the future."

I did enjoy my stay just a few things that were not as described. There was a coffee machine but no coffee as described the bed being where it was had a light switch but no light which made it difficult to go up and down the ladder during the night. The noise from stair was particularly bad during the night this is not your fault but maybe mention 'it can be noisy'."

38368803,533247241,2019-09-21,206894954,Federico,Very comfortable and cozy apartment for vacations in Paris. Its location is perfect for walking around and get to know Montparnasse (walking distance from the catacombs Montparnasse Tour Luxembourg gardens etc.). It is literally 10 m away from Rue Daguerre.. which is full of nice restaurants and boulangeries. Recommended.

It's not 2 separate room 1 room + 1 Sofa bed. Host communication is excellent friendly very easy instruction Fast wifi (love it).

13557006,202400525,2017-10-11,95206513,Max,Fanny s Appartement liegt super zentral und dennoch ruhig in Paris. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten des Stadtzentrums sind zu Fuss oder in wenigen Metrostationen zu erreichen. Die Kommunikation mit Fanny erfolgte reibungslos und unkompliziert. Sie gab sehr nette Tipps und Wegbeschreibungen. Das Appartment war sauber und gut eingerichtet. Das Bett (Matraze) war sehr bequem für zwei Personen jedoch vll. etwas klein. Die Küche war etwas spärlich ausgerüstet aber ausreichend für kleine Mahlzeiten. Insgesamt kann ich Fanny s Unterkunft im Herzen von Paris ausserordentlich empfehlen.
5381014,292075293,2018-07-17,61846107,Lorena,Best location in London! You can walk to several Paris attractions marketplace and metro station. Really amazing and safe neighborhood. We were three adults and had enough space. The only part we didn’t enjoy that much was that several parts of the apartment are a little neglected... uncared for. Several electrical outlets are falling several cabinets are loose or falling and the toilet area had a continuous bad odor. There was lint/fluff in several parts too. So if you can deal with that the location is AMAZING!
24095948,467908421,2019-06-11,184625966,Aleana,I wish I could give this place a hundred 10/10 reviews. We loved it!! It was such a beautiful and welcoming space. If you're like me (a broke college student) you might be tiny bit hesitant about the price but let me tell you. It is worth every penny and two hundred dollars more. We ended up just staying in the apartment one day because it was so nice  it is close to a metro station about 7 mins walk that takes you to all the touristy spots in Paris. One super important thing to mention is that it has a fan!! In paris thats like finding an apartment with a bowling alley inside. Stay here stay here stay here. Oh he's also super nice and easy to communicate with and answers quickly. Again stay here stay here stay here!! We will when we come back to Paris.

Il est situé dans une rue calme mais à la fois proche de tout (à 5min du métro Villier) le quartier est très sympa. Eleonore est facile à contacter et  très arrangeante. C'est sa maman (adorable) qui nous à accueilli. En bref je recommande sans hésiter! :)
24002579,324452873,2018-09-17,154072495,Matt,"The suite was spotless clean at check in. There was a welcome note with a bottle of french Bordeaux wine waiting for us when we got there. The place had a mini fridge and a nice new glass stove top. He has a Nespresso machine which was nice for a quick espresso in the morning to enjoy on the balcony. There is also a nice and clean tiled shower with no shortage of hot water or pressure. Gautier gave us some very useful recommendations for local places to eat and activities to do in the area.

I would definitely stay at this Airbnb again!"
12140643,204869775,2017-10-20,70976316,Agus,Fue buena la estancia en lo de Vincent. Para dos personas es un apartamento muy cómodo nosotros eramos 4 y quizás no era cómodo el uso del baño. Al no estar separado de la habitación teníamos que avisar cuándo uno iba.al baño para que el otro salga de la habitación o espere ahí dentro. (Esta la habitación una puerta que da al baño y otra que separa el baño de la cocina). A nosotros no nos resultó cómodo. Luego había cepillos de dientes en el.baño que no eran nuestros y algún alimento en la heladera. Quizás hay que prestar más atención en esos detalles. Él siempre tuvo predisposición y la comunicación era buena.
19922231,196872588,2017-09-24,42501397,Lilla,"This property is a nice property well located 7 mins walk from Gare du Nord.  The property is well equipped; lovely big bathroom and good sized kitchen.  Bedroom is a sofa bed which we had to make for ourselves upon arrival.  Sheets were nice and clean but bedding had seen better days. Wifi was very slow should be updated.  Our main problem was the check in.  We did not realise that the property was run by an agency called Iambnb. I was told before I came that someone would be at the property at a specific time but they were not there.  I also called before I left the station to let them know I would arrive soon and still no one to meet us.  We waited for 50 mins outside the property and had to call the company 3 times (once being left on hold for 12 minutes) before we found out that the guy meeting us was delayed.  The guy who met us was nice but did not know the property or area at all so could not give us tips.

Overall good location good apartment but lacked in communication and personal touches."

Cela nous a beaucoup aidé pour nous orienter dans Paris. Merci encore Dominique ! L'appartement est identique aux photos très lumineux (même quand le temps est gris) Il y a tout ce qu'il faut. Effectivement le passage du métro à proximité est nuisible. (penser aux boules quies ;-)) même si le passage durant la nuit est moins fréquent.  En tout cas un très bon weekend trop court bien sûr !! 
13460398,446425420,2019-05-01,67270660,Brittany And Travis,Our stay at Anne and Ulysse's apartment was wonderful.

Clean and well organized we have been able to prepare our Christmas lunch with no issue :) I would recommend this place and I will not hesitate to book here again if back in Paris. Just a small suggestion: for a short stay these is no problem but for a longer one a wardrobe would be very appreciated.
Thanks

29050588,468408098,2019-06-12,52142982,Sridhar,It is a much smaller studio room than seen in the pictures. Good enough for single traveller/couple. It will be a bit difficult for families with children.

Typical Parisian apartment with very large 3 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms.

11310067,555803008,2019-10-28,238185093,Kusum,The place is very well located - close to the metro supermarket cafes and major attractions. However small when the bed is pulled out so a bit more elbow room would be good. Maybe a bit of adjustment to the side sofa would be good. Otherwise terrific place.

753143,239302469,2018-03-01,29188094,Pradyumna,Vincent is a great host. For starters he allowed me to come in and drop my bag before the check in time of 2 pm. I reached at 10 am and he made sure I could leave my bag with him safely. The home is cozy and beautiful. It is a two room apartment and a very short walk to the metro. You will get one room for your self. The room is done up really nicely. It is excellent for anyone who wants to explore Paris. The location is great and the closeness to the metro makes it perfect. Vincent is kind and understanding and makes you feel at home. I look forward to being back!

8594324,355878445,2018-12-06,11801597,Lauren,Yue's apartment is absolutely beautiful and had everything we needed to enjoy a comfortable stay in Paris.  The canal area is cute and has a lot of cool restaurants to try.  She was a great host and offered us a list of places to try during our stay.  The only issue we had was getting into the apartment the first day.  She gave us the codes but we didnt know you had to push the door instead of pull it!  A bit of shaky first few minutes and we were exhausted from our flight.  The hot water situation was the only other issue we had.  My advice to you is to try to take quick showers!  Otherwise everything else was perfect! Thanks Yue!
3180419,38476372,2015-07-16,25409284,Michael,The place was fantastic and Nathalie was extremely accommodating. Our kids liked everything so much they asked if we could move there. We would definitely recommend this place this great location and Nathalie as a host again.

7144989,204513532,2017-10-18,51332887,Donovan,"Lock your door. There are multiple travelers there on any given night. My room was broken into while I was sleeping all my money was stolen along with my shaving kit. When I asked host to please look in the room of a semi-permanent guest (he complained often about money problems) she refused and accused me of accusing him!  Then she told me to leave (13 days before my scheduled departure) saying she didn’t want me there if I didn’t trust guests and feel “secure”! 
Besides all of that the room (in a 4 bedroom house) was extremely sparse with only a low thin fouton and a rolling rack to hang your clothes on (I had to ask for hangers twice. 
The kitchen is adequate but to get back to my room I had to climb 3 flights of stairs not shown in the pictures. 
Very bad experience there given that I had to find a place to stay in less than 8 hours. I wound up going to a hotel that cost much more.
Beware of this place. Sleep with your valuables under your pillow!"

She knows her neighborhood and her city very well and is very generous with her time and advice to us visitors. She goes out of her way to make sure we have a sweet homey experience.  Both Sophie and her partner Thierry speak good English and are great conversationists that we enjoyed immensely. Sophie is a great communicator throughout the booking and visiting process. She was also very accommodating on our early check-in request and the late night return. Staying with Sophie was like a home away from home!

The bed was comfortable but the bedroom is small quite like a studio apartment rather than a one bedroom. The sofa bed is very uncomfortable and there are no blinds in the living room so this apartment is better in my opinion only for 2 people. 
We had a lovely stay in Anna Jacqueline's place as it was close to the George V metro line and close to a lot of shops/restaurants/bars. She had left a booklet for all the places she recommended to go to in Paris which was very helpful. Thank you very much.

Best Wishes

It was very well located for our needs and had everything we needed. We particularly appreciated the washing machine. She has gone to some effort to provide useful information about the locale.
566867,484646067,2019-07-09,182695428,Kim,"The experience of staying at Rafic and Jasmines apartment is wonderful from the very beginning. The communication is first class and Rafic will go out of his way to meet you on arrival and even carry your bags upstairs! His personal greeting  sets this apartment apart from the rest with a personal explanation of the apartment features and reassurance that if help is required he is only a message away! It is invaluable peace of mind when travelling to a foreign city for the first time to have this contact and with Rafic and Jasmine living next door it is even better! 

The apartment itself is stunning and extremely comfortable. The beds are first class and for the really hot weather air conditioning is available - although the evening breeze through the windows is lovely. It is located in a really quiet and peaceful neighbourhood. There is a choice of three metro stops nearby which makes exploring the city easy. The area itself features the Eiffel Tower as well the Hotel des Invalides and the Musée Rodin (which was brilliant)! 

I cannot recommend staying here enough for the hospitality peace of mind location comfort and ambience of the apartment itself and an all round first class base for any Parisian adventure!"
348747,334882409,2018-10-10,17422128,James,"This is a very beautiful home and a wonderful place to stay.

Communication was excellent and I would gladly stay here again"

1396473,213654946,2017-11-22,63965416,Isabella,My mom and I came to Paris for a week in fall for my birthday and this could not have been a more perfect stay. It was exactly as pictured a very quaint clean Parisian apartment! We loved that it was on the first floor as elevators are not common in Paris apartment buildings. The location was absolutely perfect less than a block from the Solferino metro stop that can take you all over the city. There was an amazing Boulangerie at the top of the street as well Gosselin. Check in was smooth easy and convenient. Would for sure come back and recommend to all!
24054752,367140728,2019-01-04,21419930,Mark,Yankel's place worked very well for our family of 4. It's a cute little flat in a great location near Montorgueil. The furniture is stylish comfortable and functional and the kitchen was stoked with everything we needed although we didn't really cook. The small dining table fit us fine albeit a little tight! The terrace was really nice even in winter as it was nice to be able to go outside. The bed was comfortable and the sofa bed worked well for the kids. Linens etc were provided. Yankel was very easy to communicate with and was accommodating with our arrival and departure. The only negatives for us were that the apartment smelled of smoke and the bathroom didn't smell good. Overall a great place to stay in Paris!

179604,74580944,2016-05-16,7243090,Jerrell,Had a great stay in Edouard's flat. The location is amazing centrally located in the Marais and very close to restaurants and markets.  The flat is a studio so it's cozy but enough room for one or two people. It has everything you need with a full kitchen if you are inclined to cook. It's a fourth floor walk up so may be a challenge if you have a lot of luggage but it's not too bad. 
18496634,483984976,2019-07-08,14697353,Anna Regina,Beautiful apartment! Very clean confortable and well located. It was perfect for my family (2 adults and 2 kids).  Jocelyne was very kind and answered our messages quickly when it was necessary.  Great time in Paris!

6421927,36122551,2015-06-25,31382462,Jess,"This is truly the key to a great experience in Paris! I stayed in Gaia's apartment for three nights in June with two friends it was plenty big and incredibly comfy. The view out the main window will melt your heart along with the local surroundings. This quiet hidden corner of Paris has a small cafe outside (great coffee) metro station supermarket and bike hire all on your doorstep.  

Gaia ensured we had everything we needed for check in and check out. Whilst unavailable to meet us personally ensured our first arriving guest was personally greater and showed around the place. 

I would recommended this apartment to any group of 1-4 staying in Paris. "

Carine was very responsive and a tremendous host.  We were unable as Americans to get the dryer to operate even though there was electricity and Carine responded right away that we must be needing to empty the water.  Didn't even occur us.

The neighborhood is quiet and there is a decent market on the corner and a huge market within 3 blocks.  Loved it and would certainly come back next time I am in Paris."

35565136,523635114,2019-09-04,53459675,Victoria,Overall recommend if you mostly need a budget place to sleep and are somewhat familiar or comfortable with navigating Paris. a redeeming factor - location is near market and metro and construction ; for the same reason it can be a bit loud for light sleepers. Picking up the keys was a bit far and inconvenient with luggage and drop off of the keys upon checkout was at a better location but the employees seemed clueless when I asked about where to drop off--I walked throughout the space to locate the key box by myself.  if you use Stasher as Salim helpfully recommends I recommend downloading before reaching Paris and checking locations as we were not able to find a convenient place to stash our luggage while waiting to check-in. A quick elevator was a plus but be aware if you're bringing luggage that there is a step between the sweet and the entrance to the apartment building otherwise it was flat. Salim's directions with keys and entry to apartment building were clear. The space was cleaned but be aware that you will have to put in some work (clean sheets and pillows will be stacked and you'll have to make your bed).There are no curtains which meant it was incredibly hot and one of my members ended up napping on the floor instead of on the futon in direct sunlight. If you don't plan on being in the apartment during the day when it's hot this may not be a problem for you. We also blew a fuse but thankfully Salim is responsive with communication and instructions so I advise for folks to be cautious with bringing adapters if from out of the country. Laundry machine was a huge plus and we dried our clothes on the balcony (there was some random stuff that seemed to have been there for a while which we tried to work around) the stove heats up quickly and was handy.  freezer freezes quickly. The shower temperature kind of fluctuates and I guess this is a building problem and not something that could be changed. The water shut off unexpectedly on our last day (no flushing toilet sink/shower not working) and Salim advised me to see if any signs were posted and  indeed there was a sign in French about planned maintenance and gave tenants a deadline to contact building management to prevent the shutoff  if that time did not work but it seemed it was a surprise to Salim too. Salim apologized that it happened while we were there. Overall it was a mixed experience but I would recommend --just know what you're walking into! And I think you'll be okay.
34596026,493895520,2019-07-23,76894470,Aksel,Wonderfull and intimate appartment with a great view. It’s small but has everything that is needed and is perfect for one to two persons looking to explore Paris. It was also clean and all the essentials where prepared when i arrived.

16331803,213257056,2017-11-20,28056830,Floris,The room is really well equipped. Ludivine was a very great host which rescheduled her weekend to adapt on our changed travel plans. Can't say a negative word about the place. Only the neighborhood was maybe not the best in Paris but would say the price is absolutely reasonable for it.
863566,46758851,2015-09-13,7366252,Brigitte,"Best location with metro and many supermarkets and cafes nearby. 
Photos manage to make apartment look much bigger than actually was. If bed is out unable to use bathroom/ no floor space. 
Recommend that you don't have luggage and really only for 1 person as the 2 of us barley fit. 
Requested linen and towels and only got enough for 1 person.
At the end of the day 8 square meters means 8 square meters.
Other than that 
Sab was great with communication however and the wifi was really strong! Beautiful building too. "

She greeted us with great warmth and answered all our questions. We had no problems while staying at the apartment and love the location - close to the Luxembourg gardens 3 metro stations and an outdoor ""bio"" market - the quiet and the light and airy space. We highly recommend the apartment Séverine and her friend Jeanne and will stay there again for sure."
26314342,504280466,2019-08-07,41473122,Francesco,Très bel appartement équipements neufs et complets. Très propre. Étant avec trois enfants nous avons manqué un peu d'espace mais je suppose que cela correspond à la réalité des locations à Paris. Vraiment parfait pour un couple voir trois adultes. Supermarché stations de métro cafés et restos à proximité. Ce fût une expérience très positive.
799369,103153044,2016-09-20,5103850,Andy,"Laurence was a very welcoming host and communicative. She even made me a pizza for lunch totally unexpected and nice. The three cats are very sweet too. This was a great place to stay 10 mins from the Bibliotheque Francois Mitterrand for work and superb value for Paris. Thoroughly recommend Laurence.

Unfortunately it ended on a bad note when I accidentally knocked over one of her bedroom ornaments and smashed it... 

PS. Laurence doesn't speak English so you need to have a decent command of French"

Es ist sehr klein und man muss sich schon mögen um ein paar Tage dort zu verbringen. Gekocht haben wir zwar nicht aber ich glaube es ist einiges dazu vorhanden. Handtücher hat es zwar aber nur kleine. Für uns war das aber genug. Allgemein würden wir dort nochmals hingehen.

El interior del piso es maravilloso te sientes como en casa completamente equipado tanto en cocina como en baños como en dormitorios con unas estanterías llenas de libros en definitiva al volver de paternos Paris tenías la sensación de volver al hogar para descansar cargar las pilas y volver a la aventura de conocer Paris al día siguiente. 
Stephane ha estado pendiente de todo lo que pudiéramos preguntarle
Todo un lujo.
Gracias por todo han sido unos días increíbles en Paris."

Also this was my first Airbnb and I was nervous it might. It work out especially since we came from the states. No need to worry!"
5889135,496115363,2019-07-27,85298414,Brenda,Thank you to Sophie for your great communication and suggestions to local eateries and shops.   Despite being in Paris during a horrible heatwave we were able to stay cool with AC in the bedrooms. Sophie was extremely courteous and made us feel welcome encouraging us to use whatever goods were left in her pantry cleared space for us in her fridge and even left us detergent if we wished to launder our clothes.  Our only wish was that we had fans in the downstairs (no AC) because it was very hot-even with the windows open especially when the afternoon sun comes in thru the beautiful balcony windows.

Même si nous ne l'avons pas directement rencontré elle était disponible pour chaque question que l'on pouvait avoir et nous a même donné quelques conseils et bonnes adresses. Le quartier dans lequel elle habite est calme et à la fois très bien placé : tous transports à proximité gare de Lyon située à à peine 15 minutes en bus et centre à 30 minutes à pieds.. le quartier est vivant et beaucoup de petits commerces se trouvent à côté.

7031178,82683860,2016-06-28,25282581,Wayne,"Fantastic flat in an unbeatable location. Very clean and sunny.

The fridge was stocked with a few essentials which made our first morning's breakfast easy.  Silverware and dishes were more than adequate to spend a few weeks here.

For those who are light sleepers I recommend that you use good earplugs. The floors above creek with each of the neighbor's footsteps.  As the tenant above tends to keep late hours this can be frustrating.

We loved our time in Paris and can't wait to return.

16293886,144191449,2017-04-15,39379824,Peter,If you're looking for a great location you can't beat Maria's place! It's a short distance from the Arc de Triomphe which means that it's within easy walking distance from any site off the Champes Elysee. The other great thing about the location is that it's off one of the quieter streets coming off the rotary so the street noise is minimal and very safe. The apartment is very clean and just as the pictures show. We would go back here in a heart beat the next time we visit Paris!

The studio is larger than I expected comfortable clean cozy and lively. On 
Tuesday nights the restaurant downstairs plays live music and it was a delight to look out over the rooftops on the balcony while a guitar and piano and accordion played below. What atmosphere! This location is great if you already know Paris and want to get to know Montmartre better or want to get a more authentic Paris living experience. The neighborhood feels young and relaxed and it's easy walking distance to the metro the post restaurants views bakeries the cemetery etc. The 12 line makes it easy to jump down to the more touristy places like Concorde or continue down to the lovely 7th. I highly recommend this apartment. Merci bien Sarah!  "

The apartment is located in a quieter neighborhood with walking access to the Eiffel Tower Seine River and Arc de Triomphe. I enjoyed regular walks down to the overlook of the Eiffel Tower and loved having my coffee each morning by the beautiful French doors that open onto small patios overlooking the street.

Evguenia took the time to stop by the apartment after I had settled in to answer any questions and provide recommendations for what to see in the neighborhood. And I am SO glad she did--I had the best dinner purchased from amazing shops on the nearby Rue des Belles Feuilles all thanks to Evguenia's tips. I would absolutely recommend this apartment and will stay here again when I am next in Paris! "

The best part of this apartment is it’s locations.  It is only minutes away from the metro entrance that will take you anywhere.  You are in the opera district close to the Louvre and Opera House.  I would download Citymapper which is a free app that tells you what transportation to take to get to your destination the quickest.  They are so detail oriented and stocked the apartment with linens towels shampoo conditioner & soap.  Follow the instructions to use all amenities it is in the book.  I only wish I had stayed longer 5 days to see Paris were too few!  I will be back soon and will definitely rent again from Frederic.  While we were there we did have a question to which he responded quickly.  Thank you for an amazing stay!  I would recommend for families great comfortable accommodations.

Best felafel places right underneath (was in New York Post & Rick Steves book). Never met our host but that was because our flight delays Erik waited for a while for us. He text me easy instructions how to get into the apartment. Very safe neighborhood. Two girls traveling and we always felt safe walking to our apartment late night from the metro stop (5mins walk). 
1319128,124647372,2017-01-02,20105026,Lucy,This is one of the best airbnbs we've ever stayed in. Just perfect for 2 people with lovely furniture and all mod-cons and very quiet despite being near the busy Rue de Rennes. It has been decorated throughout with love and care and it shows. Although the bathroom is tiny the shower is nice and big and the water hot and plentiful. The only small quibble was theat the bed was a bit firm for those like us with very bad backs but Zazie can sort that out with a mattress topper and was very willing to do so. She is also brilliant at recommending restaurants and museums you might not otherwise know about so do take her advice! The area is fantastic with the Jardin de Luxembourg a short way away and brilliant bus and metro links. I cannot recommend this place highly enough and if I could give it more than 5* I would. It was the best New Year my husband and I have ever spent and fantastic to be in Paris again in such comfort. 
13135280,85361674,2016-07-11,13202057,Guy,Staying at Edouard's was a brilliant experience and would definitely recommend it! My girlfriend and I visited Paris for a short weekend away and had an amazing time. The apartment itself is very spacious and has a really good feel to it - particularly enjoyed the luxury of having breakfast on the balcony in the morning. It's in a fantastic location and a great base to explore the city - just a short walk from numerous metro stations. Ed was really helpful when it came to picking up the keys (despite us arriving late) and had some great recommendations in the local area to explore in the welcome book. Would definitely stay again.

The worst came later the apartment was very very dirty with leftover food on the floor loose clothes bedding not changed nor towels.  It was a bad experience.  I do not recommend it to anyone.

12665782,444007152,2019-04-27,4690471,Ana,"Gina's apartment in Paris was a good place to stay.  Here's what we liked:
It was incredibly quiet even though it was situated on a busy vibrant street.  I think it helped that the apartment was located on a private and very quiet long plant-filled narrow courtyard (or alley) that was behind a large locked set of doors.  The ground floor apartment itself is quite cute and even relatively spacious for a small apartment in a large cosmopolitan city like Paris.  The shower had great water pressure there was a very useful washing machine/dryer and a small but efficient dishwasher.  The stovetop was easy to use.  The apartment was walking distance (if you enjoy walking) from the Ile de la Cite as well as the Marais the Picasso Museum the Canal St. Martin etc.  There were also a few Metro stations within a couple of blocks of the apartment that made getting pretty much anywhere in Paris quite easy.  The neighborhood itself is incredibly diverse in terms of the people you see and the wonderful food shops and restaurants.  We never felt unsafe even when returning home very late in the evening.

Here's what we didn't like:
NOTE: When we chose this apartment there were not many choices available in the areas we preferred so this review is written in the context of not quite having found a place we thought we'd love - in other words we knew we weren't getting our first choice!  While the decor and style are fun and interesting it's a bit tired and worn.  We've travelled to Paris a few times and have seen the major sites and this time we'd wanted to have a ""Julia Childs'"" experience: going to food/farmers' markets and taking advantage of France's delicious food products to cook up yummy meals.  But we found the apartment not terribly appealing to spend much time in so we ended up shifting our focus and went out for meals most of the time.  That was disappointing.  Additionally Gina tended to take more time to respond than all other Airbnb hosts that we've had in the past and this made planning our trip and arriving there a bit more stressful than it needed to be.  We didn't have much communication but the little interaction we did have was often slow.  It's not clear why that's the case.  But Gina was always polite and nice despite not being very available.  Her daughter was very sweet and helpful when checking us in.

Overall the apartment is a good place to stay and is very well located.   It definitely gives you a sense of living in a Parisian neighborhood without many tourists at all.  And finally the boulangerie/cafe and the cheese shop just steps from the apartment are really fantastic!"

4389986,50298873,2015-10-11,41749940,Vi,"What a great first experience with AirBnB!  Yves' apartment was so perfect that our other rentals have not been able to live up to.  Not only was the apartment stocked with anything and everything you might need but it was also so clean!  Honestly the apartment looked practically new.  It was perfectly located in Paris close to several Metro stations and of course in the beautiful Le Marais district where the streets are lined with great restaurants and shops.  For being so centrally located his apartment was actually quite quiet and warm!  We never needed to use the heater the entire time we were there.  

To make this experience even better Yves was such a gracious host.  He stocked our refrigerator with juice water and a bottle of wine!  He helped with our luggage and was always there to answer any questions we needed.  If we ever came back to Paris again I would definitely rent Yves' apartment in a heartbeat.  Merci Yves!"

3393864,75969115,2016-05-23,38700486,Sebastián,Varias cosas para decir. Por un lado lo positivo. La ubicación es absolutamente inmejorable y el departamento hermoso. Pero también decir algunas cosas no tan buenas. Cuando llegamos había un varón cuando Maud nos había dicho que iba a estar ella y no solo eso sino que cuando le volví a escribir a Maud para ver por qué no había venido ni me contesto. Entiendo que la inseguridad no es un tema en París pero nos dio algo de desconfianza la situación.  Por otro lado nos dejó solo el edredón sin sabana dando un poco de sensación de suciedad
24117882,343988693,2018-11-02,45089639,Margarita,Es un apartamento acogedor limpio y muy bien comunicado. El único punto negativo es que por la noche se oye bastante el tráfico que no cesa nunca al ser una arteria principal de París.

1638246,168213888,2017-07-09,12574325,Ken,The place looked exactly like in the pictures. Location is awesome as it is in the center of marais. Lots of food choices. I would have given this a full 5 stars if not for the communication problem we had over bathroom / toilet flush issue. During the entire stay we had to fill up a trash bin and pour water in the toilet to flush becauSe it didn't work at all. Mind you there is only one toilet even though there are 1 bathrooms. At one point it took them 17 hours to reply to my text message. I understand they won't be able to run and fix the problem immediately but it would be nice to at least acknowledge receipt of messages. I would text to the phone number provides and message using Airbnb app. They ended up not fixing the problem despite claims of multiple visits to fix the problem (we were out during daytime to do touristy stuff so we don't have means of verifying the efforts to fix but I believe they tried). Over all a decent stay despite of this one misstep on their part.

The apartment was one of the cleanest places I have ever seen - he should be so proud of how well he keeps his home.
Apartment is in a lovely area - so near to many things - supermarkets restaurants bakeries metro. Great location.

Stephane was so thoughtful he had bought us stuff for our first breakfast which I thought was so kind of him & was very much appreciated.

This lovely apartment made our trip to Paris as at the end of a long day walking around we knew we were coming back to a nice warm cosy apartment rather than being stuck in a small hotel room. I would highly recommend this beautiful apartment it was like a home away from home so much nicer than staying in a hotel.

You won't be sorry you stayed here - so Book Straight Away

Thank you Stephane for letting us use your lovely home for our trip

9289098,308759328,2018-08-17,50765946,Zack,Jerome’s place is like a hidden treasure in the heart of Paris. For a Parisian studio it is MASSIVE! The kitchen and bathrooms were clean and useful the studios decor kept me and my family in awe and not to mention the large windows that pour light into the home. Located right off a major metro station it’s highly accessible to Versailles CDG the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame. Highly recommend!

2529423,310299208,2018-08-19,193754845,Kristen,Our stay at Philippe’s place was convenient - we were right near the metro! It was spacious and clean for our stay and the AC was helpful in the summer. It was difficult arriving and leaving with our luggage going up 7 flights of spiral stairs as well as going up and down that everyday but we got used to it! Something to keep in mind as their is no elevator and on the top floor. Philippe was accommodating during our stay!

22884117,269973141,2018-05-28,19968482,Mykhailo,We enjoyed our staying in this apartments very nice and cozy flat. It takes around 20 mins to Eiffel Tower by foot subway station is very close plenty supermarkets nearby(some of them were open even on Sunday). It was a little bit stuffy cause the apartment is on the first floor and we closed the windows in the night time( the district is very safe and maybe we should keep them more opened). Anyway the host was very friendly and answered on all our questions immediately when we asked for ventilator - she brought it on the next day. Thanks her a lot. We fully recommend this apartments
19029,645513,2011-10-19,1057211,Tyler,We really enjoyed our stay at Anna's studio. The location was great (near Montmartre and Moulin Rough) with great access to tourist sites and the Paris metro. The studio itself had a great street view and balcony -- perfect for breakfast or an evening glass of wine. And the small kitchen was really convenient. Thanks for everything Anna!

19237335,316390360,2018-08-31,50358685,Susana,El departamento está ubicado en un 4 piso hay que subir 70 escalones sin ascensor con maletas no es para todos. Esta bien ubicado pero deben saber que Kevin vive en el lugar por lo que está lleno de cosas suyas. Otra cosa a tener en cuenta es que las llaves tienen que retirarlas en un bar a unas cuadras en una caja de seguridad con clave esto se complica un poco y si se marchan temprano como fue nuestro caso tivumos que llevar la llave a una caja de seguridad a un hotel bastante más alejado lo que significó desviar el viaje al aeropuerto
4065107,352539170,2018-11-25,23712377,Amy,My aunt and I loved staying in this beautiful large apartment located in St. Germaine. There are several wonderful bakeries restaurants and shops located right outside the door. The apartment is decorated beautifully and we especially enjoyed soaking in the large bathtubs after long days strolling around Paris. The beds were firm and comfortable and we both slept great in the 2 quiet bedrooms. The host Angie communicated with us ahead of time and throughout our stay. The building custodian Juliette was so kind to us at checkin and we feel like we made a new friend! We would most definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this apartment to others!

33794093,458009759,2019-05-25,190644992,Cameron,The Airbnb in Paris was cute and cozy with a great central location. The hosts were quick to respond to messages and questions. Unfortunately the neighbors in the surrounding rooms frequently had parties until 4 in the morning. I realize this is out of the host’s control but it is something to keep in mind because it happened on several occasions. Nonetheless the apartment was close to a central metro station and the local bakery recommendation made by the host was great.
13879570,249529202,2018-04-02,13265613,Camille,"L'appartement était parfait pour notre week-end prolongé à Paris. Situé juste à côté de la Cigale et entre deux arrêts de métro il est très pratique de se déplacer en ville depuis cette localisation. Le fait d'être dans une cour arrière rend l'appartement calme. Nous n'avons pas pu rencontrer Bertrand mais tous nos échanges ce sont bien passés il a été très sympathique et nous nous sommes sentis à l'aise dans l'appartement.  
Je dirai juste un petit point négatif le canapé lit n'est pas idéal pour les personnes ayant des problèmes de dos (ce n'était pas notre cas mais je préviens pour les suivants...)."

7028998,489125567,2019-07-16,72610994,Aliza,The apartment was set up very well. Do note that it’s five flights of stairs. The major downside was that the shower wasn’t working when we were there. Jeanne was super responsive and came in to fix it but it was a bummer to not be able to shower one night. Other than that the apartment was great!
440959,15689788,2014-07-14,1388959,Leretia,My friend and I had an absolutely wonderful stay at Carole's apartment. It was tastefully designed and decorated and oozed of Parisian charm right from the moment we stepped out of the lift! The room was clean detailed and presented exactly as how the pictures showed. Carole was a very lovely host who was attentive and thoughtful of our needs in every way. She comes across as knowledgeable learned and wise. It is only a pity that we didn't have more time and opportunities to chat (due to our busy schedules) and learn more from her. On a separate note I already missed waking up to the smell of warm sweet smelling fresh croissants every morning at Carole's place! 
17938025,413825085,2019-02-18,11090266,Jacqui,"This location cannot be beaten everything was a breeze to get to.  The apartment is surrounded by places to eat  catering for all tastes & there is a supermarket selling all the essentials and more within a minutes walk.
The self check in and the facility to leave bags makes this a very flexible option for those arriving early  allowing you to drop bags off before those already in residence have formally checked out.  Other reviews advise you to take note of the bathroom set up and  I would echo that. It is not a problem if you have the whole place booked out but if you were sharing with another booking ( if that is an option ?? ) then it may bother some people. That said all 3 showers were very clean with lots of hot water and they were certainly all powerful. 
This is great place for a family or a group of friends  its a large and airy footprint over 2 floors . My only word of caution would be that  if your preference is to cater for yourself then this may not be for you as the kitchen set up is interesting and it is some what lacking in basic things like cutlery and glasses ..............but hey  this is Paris ......you should be eating out !!"
22731841,503523995,2019-08-06,13098876,Kimberly,"Greg's place is an amazing location. It sits on the 2nd floor walk up (that is two flights for us American's) on a square that has two of Paris's best restaurants (according to Conde Nast Traveler) Le Comptoir (and it's counter companions of La Mer and La Terre) and Brieizh. There are several other cute cafes that bustle all day long. The spot is also a short walk to all the great parts of the left bank and a easy walk to the Seine. If you are looking for an amazing location at an affordable price this is a great choice.  
A couple of key things to consider. The 2nd floor walk up is a narrow and steep staircase in an old Paris building. Very common in Paris. If you have heavy luggage you'll need to port it up (we did) or if you have mobility issues this may not be your spot. The apartment does not have air conditioning. While this won't be an issue when the weather is cool during the summer you'll want to sleep with the windows open. That does keep the room cool but the aforementioned amazing square below has a vibrant nightlife that you'll hear every word of until 1am or later. Of course if you sitting at one of the cafes you won't care (we did that). You'll also hear the restaurants preparing for the day each morning by 6a. Again only a consideration if you have the windows open. When the windows are closed you hear very little. 
Greg was great with communication up to and during our stay. The check-in was easy even when our train was delayed. 
Finally the previous reviews mention some challenges with bed bugs. We did not have any issues with this. The place was clean and the bed slept well enough. In our opinion that issue has been resolved. 
I recommend Greg's spot for someone looking to be in the heart of St. Germaine and want to be part of the action. It's a great fun location. Perfect for a solo traveler or a couple."

The location was perfect super close to the metro in one of the nicest parts of Paris. Still very central and close enough journey to monuments. I’d recommend a few more cooking utensils but other than that the flat is well equipped in an efficient and quirky way. I’d recommend for a weekend break or even a longer stay like mine.

11791883,165601063,2017-07-01,93601305,Shakil,Great location and clean comfortable studio room. Place felt secure as well. Anna is really helpful in communication w regards to the room and Paris itself. There are small touches to the room which add extra convenience such as two fans a general laptop to use towels some amenities in the washroom and sink. If the main purpose is just to sleep the night and keep your stuff safe then it's perfect.
20601273,344236175,2018-11-03,61515466,Joelle,Anais’s apartment is very cute. It’s on a 5th floor walkup (more like 6 flights) with a steep staircase. Make sure to bring your own towel. Really good daylight. The neighborhood is residential the metro is very close and there’s a grocery store bread store wine store etc. very close by. The apartment was a little cold for us the first few days but once we got a hang of the heating system it was great! Thanks for having us Anais!

18196226,481173417,2019-07-04,117518379,Richard,Amine's place is perfect for solo travelers who are looking for a central location in Paris. Located in the 9th Arrondissement it's surrounded by a host of relatively inexpensive and delicious eateries sidewalk cafés and bars only a 5 minute walk from the foot of Sacré-Cœur and within easy walking distance of several metro lines. The room itself is cozy but not cramped with excellent WiFi a comfortable bed and a powerful - if small - shower. Amine himself was extremely welcoming helping me bring my bags in find a laundromat respecting my privacy throughout my stay and leaving a lovely assortment of local chocolates and candies as a goodbye. I look forward to staying with him again on my next visit. Merci Beaucoup Amine!
1286875,115032467,2016-11-21,3451635,Daniela,"We had a great time at Edouards place. He was very caring and prepared everything for us perfectly. He gave us some information about the local area & also a great tip for a nice lunch place. He welcomed us very warmly. The apartment is very nice and perfectly equipped - it's a good place to be with a small group. 
I'd definitely recommend a stay! "
18821187,262808478,2018-05-10,4254641,Sean,"Yvon’s place was perfect for our (2 people) visit to Paris. Central well equipped quiet at night on top of a métro station. Basically perfect.

We had flight troubles but Yvon was very accommodating and flexible with our check-in date/time."

26484640,340554378,2018-10-24,49813182,Gabriella,I absolutely recommend Oscar’s flat the location is amazing as well as the view. He was very nice and personally welcomed us late in the evening. The flat is on the sixth floor but it is totally worth you can see the Sacre-Coeur and whole Paris from it.
33243268,514530443,2019-08-21,277609600,Arnaud,L'appartement est propre bien situé et Ari répond rapidement aux questions posées.
19655353,264905162,2018-05-15,14358504,Roberta,L'appartamento é piccolo al piano terra e carino per brevi soggiorni perfetto . Ci si deve un po' adattare ai rumori perché l'edificio é antico e ogni volta che entra o esce qualcuno sembra ti entrino in casa. La zona dell'appartamento dista con i mezzi almeno 30 minuti da tutte le attrazioni principali. Helga é stata un host molto gentile e comprensiva. Siamo stati bene.
1689438,11187348,2014-03-24,5230064,Angela,What a great stay! Perfect affordable Paris rental for a group of 4. We loved the Oberkampf neighborhood and wish we had budgeted more time to just hang out around there. It is also very convenient to many metro lines. Luce was so kind and informative and she was very helpful in letting us check in early and drop off our bags when we arrived. Luce has clearly put a lot of thought into making the experience comfortable and convenient for her guests. We really appreciated the coffee and other kitchen supplies as well as all the Paris guides and recommendations that Luce had assembled for us. I would definitely recommend this place to others. 
18028290,420939784,2019-03-08,148116650,Nicole,Laurent was a lovely host. His place is decorated very cute and it's a good location.
22541564,468683769,2019-06-13,63754429,Karen,This was such a great find in the heart of Le Marais. Everything was thought of. The slippers for the guests was a particular nice touch. Everything worked perfectly. It is a different layout that may pose challenges for someone with mobility issues but for us it was not a problem. Would definitely recommend staying here.
914032,468702604,2019-06-13,224291479,Ayesha,Sophie's place is really conveniently located. It's a small flat but has everything you need (including a really comfortable bed!). Sophie was very hospitable and I was happy I chose her place for my two days in Paris.
22358845,540284315,2019-10-03,26563962,Lena,Excellent location and great host.
20511203,457447819,2019-05-24,251448562,Jennifer,This is a bright spacious apartment by Paris standard. Location is convenient n within walking distance to Gare du Nord station. I was initially affected by all the reviews that it’s not a safe neighborhood for tourists but being Asian and having stayed there for 4days it’s really not as unsafe nor dangerous as depicted ... it’s just mainly populated by middle eastern people whom we have found to be friendly and helpful during our stay. However there are stairs leading to this apartment so may not be easily accessible for some visitors.
4150449,108951194,2016-10-18,2761801,Elise,Very friendly and nice guy. Nice experience & easy to organize.

5380414,534001801,2019-09-22,52469893,Laura,"The apartment is very well located next to a main Metro station.

As a base to just shower/sleep for a long weekend it is perfectly fine but for longer stays it might be a bit cosy! It is a little tired and worn & could do with a bit of TLC but perfectly fine for what I needed. The bed is a sofa futon but actually really comfortable. The room is actually very quiet for some places in Paris!  

I would recommend that you confirm your ETA with host prior to booking to make sure he is available to meet you as I had to change my plans for collecting the key as to collect from a key safe is not possible. 

There are rules (most of which are common sense and on here) but there are also jobs you have to do on check out (strip the bed empty the bins) which I find strange (especially when you pay a cleaning fee) and have never had to do at any other stay."
2612339,52075287,2015-10-26,36056072,Gabriele,Cedric hat uns sehr freundlich empfangen und wir bekamen alle erforderlichen Informationen. Auch im Vorfeld der Reise war die Kommunikation sehr gut. Die Wohnung ist sehr komfortabel. Sie liegt in einem sehr lebhaften Stadtteil. Ich würde jederzeit wieder bei Cedric Quartier nehmen.
34360319,543769590,2019-10-08,54135412,Vy,Recently stayed at Ben’s place and had a wonderful time. Sparkling clean with self check-in (which is always a plus for me). Reviews are accurate. The location was central and next to a metro station which made transportation very convenient. Would recommend Ben’s place for anyone staying in Paris
13205487,294551189,2018-07-22,200400567,Qiaoshuang,Christine is very nice and responded very fast to our problems. The place is lovely just as the pictures. The location is excellent: only 3-min walk to the metro station many supermarkets and restaurants nearby. An excellent choice in Paris.

15864227,322069589,2018-09-12,136273921,Suzanne,Nice facilities available although we were reluntant about using the tv in the shared space as we didn’t want to bother other residents. Nor did we use the kitchen although both were on our floor.

29323625,349032024,2018-11-16,19818763,Michael,We stayed at Geraldine's place for two nights. It is well-located near two metro stations and has an amazing view. The apartment is spacious and cozy. Communication with Geraldine was great she really is a caring host. The floor and surfaces were quite clean only smaller areas and mobile stuff felt a little sticky. The apartment has a certain smell of its own but one gets used to it quite easily. I fully recommend to stay at her place.

525128,13278210,2014-05-24,8327869,Judit,Clemence is a very friendly host and I really enjoyed my stay in her apartment. The apartment is beautiful and charming a real Parisian experience! The apartment is well equipped and it is very close to the Jardin du Luxembourg the metro station and the RER. There are plenty of shops and bars nearby. I will definitely book the apartment again the next time I visit Paris. Many thanks Clemence!  
15977444,417423083,2019-02-27,243942880,Djida,petit appartement sympa mais bruyant. Pas idéal pour ceux qui souhaitent une bonne nuit de repos nécessaire à un RDV professionnel  important.
14444800,347265481,2018-11-11,155275505,Irene,"Isabelle is a fantastic host and her apartment is absolutely outstanding. The view from her terrace is breath taking. You can peacefully dine on the terrace while seeing the Sacre-Coeur fully lit it is an amazing experience. The area is close to key places such as Montmartre about 15mins walk or Gare du Nord another 15mins.

The apartment is beautifully decorated with many colourful touches that make it a very lively environment in which to be. Both double beds are extremely comfortable one in the living room area and another one in  a separate room. The kitchen is also fully equipped with anything you may need. There is a table in the kitchen as well as in the living room so plenty of communal space. (Four of us stayed at the apartment and there were no space issues whatsoever.) Isabelle's flat is extremely clean and organised and it has beautiful natural light.

Just around the corner you can find different supermarkets and local stores for anything you may need. You have also got a few metro stops nearby which make it really easy to move around the city. 

Isabelle was very helpful all throughout our stay and communication was excellent. This apartment and host is definitely an amazing find I would definitely recommend."
32815419,521636179,2019-09-01,193246512,Salvador,"Es un apartamento moderno bien comunicado con metro.
La barrio pese a no ser tranquilo está en una calle poco transitada. Lo cual hace que se pueda dormir muy bien.

La parte de abajo aún estando bien amueblada acumula bastante humedad si se realiza una ducha diaria incluso en verano y sin llover.

Cuenta con los electrodomésticos y utensilios de cocina justos. Dos fogones una nevera y microondas sin horno y sin productos de limpieza.

En mi caso dormí en el sofá-cama es realmente cómodo y la televisión es increíble."
721162,20459442,2014-09-29,21409219,Prisca,Thank your for the wonderful time in Paris! Although we had no chance to meet you in person we felt welcome in the appartment and taken care of.

Beaucoup de lumière. Situation correcte compte tenu de la proximité du métro. Avec un bon Bordeaux en prime. Si vous avez les jambes pour gravir les escaliers jusqu'au quatrième cet appartement est un excellent choix pour le prix.

Limpio y amplio el dormitorio es muy acogedor. Jane nos esperaba con una botella de vino a nuestra llegada. 
Dispone de todos los utensilios de cocina sartenes microhondas horno lavavajillas y lavadora... Incluso armario para la ropa. El salón es amplio y tiene una mesa para dos personas para comer o cenar. Muy recomendable para 3 ó 4 días.
Gracias Jane por tu hospitalidad."
14677639,310255555,2018-08-19,6627046,Jason,"A great apartment in a local neighborhood of Paris. 

We loved Loic’s apartment. It’s located about 2 minutes walk from 2 different metro stations. There’s a farmers market every Tuesday and Friday with TONS of fresh produce. The neighborhood is very safe and we felt comfortable walking around at all hours of the day or night. 

Within 5 minutes walk there are bakeries cafes restaurants and grocery stores. 

The apartment was spotless and has everything needed for cooking at home if you want. The shower is large and has more than enough hot water.  The WiFi is fast. 

Check in with Loic was simple and he was prompt responding to all questions. The bed is very comfortable and the pull-out sofa bed is quite comfortable too. 

If you’re looking for an apartment in a fun local neighborhood of Paris this is a GREAT location. Would definitely stay here again. "

14894372,247392733,2018-03-28,537100,Kristian,Min kone og jeg sov tre nætter i lejligheden. Perfekt til et par der gerne vil opleve det centrale Paris. Monica bød is velkommen da vi kom og gav os gode tips til nabolaget. Kommer gerne igen
37715385,514041645,2019-08-20,77325407,Maud,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4067671,553465145,2019-10-24,248614788,Lisa,The apartment is in a wonderful area full of restaurants and shops. It is high enough that noise was not a factor at all despite it being a bustling area. The apartment was very clean. The 5 flights of stairs are no joke so just be prepared. There wasn’t any shampoo so bring your own. It’s not a glamorous apartment but well kept and spacious enough for our family of 4 and a great value. Solid choice.
503569,2934623,2012-11-21,3606834,Alexandra,my host have done all he could 
3995331,196156015,2017-09-22,18841557,Trish,Pleasant and clean though quite small perfect for a couple or a single traveler but not ideal for parties of more than 2. Very close to the sights with a wide selection of restaurants. Host contact was unanswered for a couple of days and we were without hot water though once contact was made it was swiftly resolved. Should be mentioned that it is on the 5th story and is not conducive for luggage so definitely pack light
18197056,500011101,2019-08-01,184077054,Lucie,Beautiful and very clean apartment ! We had everything we needed for a family of 4. All the main historical places that we wanted to visit were within walking distance (the Louvre Hotel de Ville Notre Dame Cathedral Pompidou Center Les Halles etc.) we almost did not use transport. Every evening we walked in an amazing area for tourists Montorgueil where many shops cafes restaurants and entertainment. It was a 3 minute walk from our house. Apartment Windows open on different sides which is very convenient in hot weather. In addition the apartment Windows overlook the courtyards of the house so we slept quietly in absolute silence in the city center. It was a great stay ! We recommend and we will definitely be back ! Thank You Sidonie !
10939388,438650099,2019-04-17,220583084,Viktors,Wonderful (Website hidden by Airbnb) had no problems during the stay in the apartment. The apartment is very comfortable and clean.

28551624,547497287,2019-10-15,116122405,Hélène,Très bon logis conforme aux photos. Métro à 5 minutes à pied et endroit paisible pour dormir.  Le yogourt maison était excellent! J’y retournerais sans hésiter et je le recommande.
7630420,151751343,2017-05-14,9387286,Ha,"Jeff's apartment is located on Rue de Rivoli and by far was the most convenient place we've ever stayed in Paris.  We enjoyed the spacious apartment but by far the location was our favorite part.  

We were steps away from the metro and other transport which we didn't even use much.  Why?  Because we were basically located across the street from Notre Dame Saint Germain and the Latin.  Behind the apartment were the streets of Le Marais and about 10 minutes to the right of the front door were endless streets of restaurants and bars.  

We could not have asked for a better location.  Thanks Jeff!"
7043650,145411571,2017-04-18,116731972,Simon,"Pierre was an absolute pleasure to deal with before during and after our stay. He was very accommodating of our early arrival and gave us plenty of advice on where to go in the local area. The place itself was perfect for the two of us; the bed was super comfy and the shower was awesome (very important). It's on the ground floor of a fairly busy street but it's very well secured and private. The double glazed windows do a hell of a lot to keep out any unwanted noise and we weren't ever disrupted during the night.

It's ideally located in Montemartre and plonked right between two metro stations meaning getting around is a breeze. We found the area to be safe and welcoming so no worries there. It's also a really pleasant short walk over to Sacré Cœur which is just stunning. 

All in all Pierre's place is ideal for a couple looking to explore the delights of Paris we had an amazing time and would definitely visit again. Thanks Pierre! "
1867977,351304314,2018-11-22,41176429,Lara,The apartment has a very good location and a metro station in the corner. It’s simple but with everything you need. We recommend this place!
27799778,339809653,2018-10-22,177320331,Melanie,"Chokris place is gorgeous.
Much bigger than expected which for the location is an absolute find in Paris. And it’s super quiet as the building is a little way in from the Main Street. The apartment is on the second floor and there is a lift which if you have heavy luggage can accommodate one at a time. It has a cute little kitchen (which we didn’t use) and the shower is a dream with hot water and nice water pressure.
The bed was also super comfortable.
There is a cafe downstairs which is perfect for coffee and fresh orange juice in the morning and then it’s only a 2 minute walk to Place des Vosges which has cafes  restaurants and galleries all around. Le Marais is a 5 minute walk and It is also just behind Place de le Bastille which also has some cool cafes & restaurants to people watch. 
There is a supermarket 5 minutes away and a hairdressers (we were there for an event) and a pharmacy just up the road.
Having been to Paris about 6 times this has been the BEST location for me. 
Metro is close by and a taxi is quick & cheap to anywhere further.
Will definitely be staying again!"

4622452,48718214,2015-09-28,39533005,Sarah,My partner and I have just returned from 3 nights in Paris at Max's place and we loved every minute! We cannot speak highly enough of Max he is a very nice guy and went above and beyond during our stay! Max met us at a bar round the corner from the flat then showed us around the apartment and gave us a tour of the surrounding area. We forgot to bring adapter plugs and Max was more then happy to buy some for us. It was also my 25th birthday during our stay and Max recommended an amazing restaurant (the beef club which was only a 10 minute walk from the apartment incredible food and wine!) and even called the restaurant to book our table. He also bought a bottle of champagne so we could celebrate :) the apartment itself was very central round the corner from the Pompidou centre and a ten minute walk to the notre dame. The street has lots of little bars and very good bakeries we stocked up on pastries they were incredible! Max was always available to contact and replied straight away to any queries and questions we had. Big thank you Max we had a great time! Would 100% recommend :)

80260,4933378,2013-06-03,5037331,Eva,"Der Vater von Charlotte ist ein sehr guter Gastgeber (gesehen haben wir ihn allerding nie). Die Wohnung war zwar kleiner als erwartet allerdings ist sie sehr charmant eingerichtet und befindet sich in einer angenehmen Wohngegend abseits der Touristen. Wenige Meter entfernt gibt es einen Park von dem aus man einen Blick über ganz Paris hat. Mit der Metro ist man in 10 Min im Zentrum. 
Einziges Manko: Wifi funktionierte nur selten und das Bad hat keine Tür sondern nur einen Vorhang..... 

Wir haben uns dennoch sehr wohl gefühlt.

It is quiet and shutters that keep the light out which helps with time changes.
There’s a lovely bakery on street corner and a good supermarket around corner.
The closest metro station we found easy to walk to was metro Tolbiac.
We felt at home straight away."

6675025,318045338,2018-09-03,24329761,Lori,This was a good place to stay - very clean and as advertised. Shelly/Eric were quick to respond via (Hidden by Airbnb) and the key pickup process was easy. Great location as well. We had a minor issue with check-in as the previous tenants did not leave on time but that was out of their control. I do have to say though that the place is very pricey.

29118647,366196147,2019-01-02,85873217,Dani,My family and I stayed here over the new year and we were very pleasantly surprised at how convenient the location is. We did a bit of shopping so it was situated perfectly. There are a lot of fun shops right on the same street plus cafes supermarkets really anything we needed was a short walking distance away. Jameson was very quick to answer any of our questions check-in was a breeze as was check out. Would definitely book again!
3909159,77361045,2016-05-31,40678887,Katalin,"Martine was extremely helpful considerate and caring. She looked for us when we arrived late printed and brought to us our boarding passes and even went into quite some trouble to get the boarding passes.
The studio is really small but tidy somewhat lacking storage capacity. It is handy to have suitcases that can be nested into each other to occupy less room.
The location is great and quiet the Notre Dame and the Seine are at walking distance.
We definitely recommend visiting this place!"
5546980,36458104,2015-06-28,30310145,Olga,Absolutely amaising apartement. Quiet nights on the very popular street was a pleasant surprise. Very clean and shiny but not hot. Charming design. Very hospital host Frederic. Location is perfect. The only problem was because of the Airbnb agent Nadia - wrongly advertised and confirmed 4 beds for 4 persons (host meant 2 for 4) but 4 for 4 was the main reason I paid for it as I travel with mam and 2 teenagers that can't sleep together. Also bad communicationwith Nadia (I sent several messages about reaching the apartment and got no recommendations back). Still the host nicely provided 3 beds at least and had to wait 2 hours for us. My 5+ stars - for the apartment and host not for the agent.

31831625,473619495,2019-06-22,155098920,Marc,Booked the place for a happy weekend in Paris request was accepted & on the day of checking - it was canceled by the host as I modified the stay request for 3 guests in the flat (it’s advertised for 4 guests... ) With NO explanation nor replies I had to figure out alternatives. Luckily friends in Paris helped us out and we got a great flat and had superb time but the experience of being canceled on the day without warning is unpleasant and unfriendly. Must say that airbnb team was immediately supportive and quickly proposed me alternatives. While I understand you might have to cancel you just need to make an effort to communicate with the guests- but here were no answers no replies just silence. Not recommendable nor reliable listing.
3519322,92677268,2016-08-09,85701185,Ximena,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Also would have been nice to have been able to access the lift to bring our luggage to the room. Host was very helpful and did her best to sort out the plumbing issues. Overall would recommend this place to anyone looking for good value accomodation in Paris.

6719366,81420462,2016-06-23,40904304,Shirley,The location of the studio was fantastic metro access close grocery close cafes close and we felt very safe.  We could not have chosen a better location.  Amenities provided were bare minimum.  The flat was small and clean.  The bed while a real bed as advertised was on a platform on the floor.  This was inconvenient and not extremely comfortable for me.  One of the neighbors was an accomplished piano player and we had the privilege of listening to beautiful music while we were there.  What a treat!  I must say that the stairs were a challenge but very good exercise.

Eric ci ha offerto una ricca colazione  per i nostri tre giorni  e la cucina era molto attrezzata . Non mancava neanche una moka e il caffè  in polvere oltre ad una macchina da caffè con le cialde. Dall'appartamento  non sono molto lontane due fermate della metro in due zone diverse.
14949290,533895462,2019-09-22,164512942,Kate,"We would highly recommend staying in this apartment in Canal St Martin. 
It is really stylish light and airy with lovely views across Parisian rooftops. Being six floors up means that you also get to be in a fun and busy place but have peace and quiet when you’re in the apartment. The best of both worlds! 
Elina is an extremely thoughtful host who offered us advice and help if we needed it with the area. She also checked in with us a couple of times just to make sure everything was okay which we really appreciated it. Everything with checking in and out was very smooth. 
The neighbourhood is perfect - it’s also worth exploring the other side of the canal. And the market (which was on a Sunday I’m not sure if it’s on on other days as well) was excellent. 
Locally you’ll also find Merci and Le Marais is really close by. We walked to the 11éme as well to go the restaurants Fulgurances and Clamato both of which we’d recommend (if you go to Clamato be sure to stop at Septime’s cave à vin for a pre-dinner drink).
We loved Elina’s beautiful apartment!"

Linda was very quick answering our questions. arrival was very easy with code on the door and key in the post box safe.
Location is very good close by feet to the main attractions and metro supermarkets are also just behind the corner. 
Apartment is very clean it has all you need. 1 double bed and 1 sofa is enough for 4 adults. There is no TV if you need it but Wi-Fi is fact and flawless. Also the windows looking to the narrow and not very clean ""well-type"" yard. But the advantage of it is very quite inside. Price could be less but it is Paris.
Overall this apartment is recommended for travellers like us who are going to use it just for night rest and spend whole day for sightseeing."

L'appartement était tout à fait concordant à sa description donc nous fûmes très heureux de l'occuper après nos journées harassantes! Belle rénovation neuf propre de très bon goût bref: utile et agréable +++. Que dire de plus? Seul inconvénient  de sa localisation pour la sensibilité au bruit: le traffic? mais à côté du beau parc des Buttes-Chaumont. Nous y serions bien restés plus longtemps! Merci!

6724756,38769380,2015-07-18,37629826,Luisa,"My children and I had a wonderful experience visiting Paris. Staying at Kathleen&Eric's made everything run smoothly and comfortably. 
Their functional studio is spotless and everything was as described. My children and I enjoyed biking to Notredame; the public bikes are just across the street from the building. The apartment is also walking distance from the Eiffel Tower and Invalides. We also used the Metro which is conveniently located just a couple blocks from their building. Having 2 kids with me I used the kitchen and washer; both worked perfectly. . We had a lovely stay. Kat and Eric were wonderful hosts; always available for consultation on directions or what to do. I recommend staying with them to any traveler looking for a wonderful time in Paris. "

15169631,333980436,2018-10-08,120131104,Maria João,We loved Antoine’s apartment very cosy and with everything we needed. The location was excelent very charming surrounds with a lot of places to eat and drink. We strongly advice the restaurant L’Artist in the the meadle of the stairs up to the Montmartre museum.
1145013,535339326,2019-09-24,82162811,Kent,A wonderful apartment in which to stay.  The closest metro splits the city in half and travels north to south. Making exploring super easy and enjoyable. The neighborhood is vibrant and has some great places for lunch  dinner and of course dessert!!  A true experience of Paris book with he confidence of enjoying your trip immensely.
11170,939449,2012-02-21,1746388,Roxane,Very nice apartment clean and neat. Lena was very nice and helpful providing us with a list of shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. The location was perfect not very far from the metro station and many bar-restaurants around where we enjoyed to have delicious breakfasts. Loved it.
23575562,421860095,2019-03-10,31671647,Ruth,Personnellement je n'ai pas été contente de mon séjour pour plusieurs raisons:  Tout d'abord il faut savoir que Marc n'existe pas en tout cas je n'ai pas pu communiquer avec lui et si vous regardez dans les commentaires il s'est lui même auto-commenté!. En effet c'est un Hotel donc c'est avec l’équipe de l’hôtel que vous correspondez avant d'arriver et également sur place du coup je trouve que c'est très impersonnel et formel ce n'est pas du airbnb traditionnel.  Sur la description il est écrit que l’entrée se fait à 14H en leur écrivant l’hôtel me dit que le chek in se fait à partir de 15h je suis arrivée a 15H30 et j'ai du attendre 30mn car la suite n’était pas prête. Il faut savoir que l’hôtel demande votre carte bleue sur place. Il est écrit duplex sur la description : En fait quand vous ouvrez la porte de la chambre il y a des marches d'escaliers et vous arrivez à votre chambre. Je trouve ça mensonger mais quand j'en ai parlé au personnel de vérifier leur annonce ils m'ont répondu que oui si il y a des escaliers c'est un duplex et qu'ils ne sont pas architecte! Le petit déjeuner est sans plus. La terrasse est bien. Le quartier n'est pas super il faut le savoir. Pour le prix c’était vraiment une expérience décevante et c'est une première pour moi qui suis habituée au airbnb.
31028185,444105365,2019-04-27,94126111,Alex,Very clean place with awesome decorations. The location is also right next to a metro stop and tons of restaurants!
10768501,130482250,2017-02-06,11750860,Eugen,We spent a few days in Paris and didn't have any complaints to Polyna. The flat is small but clean — just good for 2 persons! 
17818885,192764924,2017-09-11,22383925,Andrew,The Flat was just as described and communication was wonderful! would definitely stay here again!

4455952,33891900,2015-06-02,22224968,Mariapaola,Non abbiamo avuto modo di conoscere Stephen personalmente per un ritardo nel nostro arrivo. Si è comunque dimostrato presente e pronto a rispondere a ogni nostra richiesta. L'appartamento è in uno stabile antico tipico della zona ed è molto comodo per il centro città e per tutte le attrazioni più visitate. In 7 e siamo riusciti a soggiornare comodamente. Unico neo il bagno piccolo ma essendo diviso tra servizi igienici e doccia era comunque sfruttabili in tempi diversi da piu persone. E' stata una bella vacanza.  Grazie!
4692142,482190246,2019-07-06,3523073,Olga,"Great stay at Charlie's place! The studio is small with a fold out sofa-bed a kitchenette containing a minifridge hotstove microwave and dishwasher and a shower. There's also a television a mirror and a fold out desk and chair. A shared bathroom is down the hall. Charlie left a lot of thoughtful touches like a plug adapter hair dryer kettle and bowl of fruit so it really felt like it had the amenities of a hotel -- but was more personal.

The location of the studio is fantastic. It is within walking distance of the Louvre Notre Dame cathedral Opera Garnier Galleries Lafayette etc. I walked everywhere and only used the metro once to get to the Opera Bastille. That said the metro is great (much better than the subway in New York) and I wished I used it more instead of walking through the heat and smoke sometimes. The Cadet metro station is 2-minutes from the apartment."
5711804,421804461,2019-03-10,58487401,Claire,Correct mais sans plus. manque de chaises (seulement 3 et nous étions 5) et de vaisselle. l'appart n'est pas prévu pour plus de 4. Heureusement très bien situé.
13907158,540799754,2019-10-04,94803096,Sarah,Christian's place was cool neighborhood was nice and super walkable. Close to metro 6 which takes you just about anywhere!
1528293,31160353,2015-05-03,23706410,Michelle,Our stay at this cute little apartment was beyond lovely. The communication through to the booking and meeting the host went well. We met up with Pierre who was a friend of the host who came to drop off the keys to the apartment and gave us some pretty good insights into where to go and what to try. He was a lot of help through out our entire journey. The flat is quite lovely it has everything that you would need when you visit the beautiful city of Paris its close to one of the larger metro stations and right down the road from everything you'd need from bars to bakeries markets pharmacies restaurants and a ton of other beautiful shops. I really enjoyed my stay  being my first time traveling to Paris it was everything that I could have needed to fully enjoy my entire 9 day stay. It really was a pleasure staying at this beautiful little Parisian apartment. I look forward to staying here again in the near future. Thank you to Pierre and to Enguerran for your hospitality and help to make up feel at home.
2671719,327657123,2018-09-24,88679984,Sebastian,Would definitely recommend staying at Melina’s place. Cute and quirky. Beautiful. Very homely! In a nice area close enough to everywhere we needed to be during our stay in Paris.

4023152,148638533,2017-05-01,34397503,Leonora,El departamento está muy bien ubicado llegué a París en tren y me fuí en avión y para ambos fue muy fácil el acceso. Si bien la cuadra es muy tranquila a 2 cuadras hay movimiento de noche y un supermercado abierto hasta las 11:30hs. Fuimos caminando a muchos lugares y para los más alejados es fácil moverse con el metro. El equipamiento del departamento es excelente estuvimos muy cómodos toda la semana.
27441508,541420291,2019-10-05,272509791,Ulisses,Anfitriã muito prestativa responde as mensagens rapidamente.

25144940,335874313,2018-10-13,191242539,Jorge Pablo,El departamento baño y cama grande muy cómodos.  La cocina con su mesita es muy chica para 4 pero nos arreglamos bien.. hay que subir 2 pisos por escalera no recomendable para llevar valijas muy grandes y pesadas..
19096809,278520834,2018-06-18,23605059,Clement,I highly recommend Antoine’s appartment. One of my best experience in AirBnb. Antoine was so kind & reactive the flat was very clean and spacious. Thank you for everything.
8785315,78220394,2016-06-05,66485871,Igor,Jonathan was an amazing host. His place is more than sufficient to rest for the next day as well as perfectly located. Leaving his apartment my wife and I could walk to all the major sites including the Louvre Eiffel Tower and the Luxemburg gardens. I would highly recommend this site if you are looking for an apartment that is affordable and walking distance from several Parisian sites. 
793750,4681906,2013-05-20,1669725,Owen,"A wonderful little apartment cosy cute great access to the Metro.  You can get to the Louvre in 20 minutes.  Was the perfect place for our weekend in Paris.

Thanks!"
13328002,170675660,2017-07-16,115069230,Shaikaayvai,Louis was a great host! My friends and I enjoyed our stay. It was perfect and close to the metro station making it easy to get any where we needed to! It was our first time in Paris and it happened to be on Bastille Day. Best weekend ever! 
15459541,492365457,2019-07-21,53906918,Eric,"We enjoyed our time here and it met our needs overall.
Our host was out of town but the key was left in a very convenient location and she was exceptionally responsive and helpful when we had questions. 
Great view from the bedroom window (if you stand at window and look right) awesome location with restaurants bars groceries and transportation nearby.  
Bathroom configuration was interesting even handy (toilet across hall from shower/sink) but shower room could use it's own door.
Pull out bed could be more comfortable but sleeps 2 in a pinch.   
6 floor walkup was not as bad as it sounds although occasionally the stairwell smelled of smoke.
I'd say great place for couple or family with small kid/s."
2325585,112416274,2016-11-06,24926131,Rebecca,"Great flat in a great area.

Charles avait laissé une bouteille de champagne au frais pour les adultes et une de Champomy pour les enfants une attention que nous avons vraiment beaucoup appréciée! 
A recommander!"

Thank you xx"
1402445,30923382,2015-04-29,21517453,Christina,The place is very convenient as it is right behind the main street of Champ Elysees. The flat is near the metro stationSt Phillipe Du Roule. However the place might be too small for four people but after a day of adjusting to it it will be fine.
17739746,148977639,2017-05-02,8429670,Stanislav,"This place is something unusual for a place to rent in Paris. It's large and warm and quiet. 
It is a proper one bedroom apartment in a non-touristy part of Paris. So you can be sure there will be quiet there is a market and family operated restaurants around. The central part of Paris are easily accessible so you get the best of two worlds. "
20032445,221393948,2017-12-26,57839665,Sophie,Welcoming bright and clean appartement!!
5213447,115654347,2016-11-26,10691364,David,Staying at David's place was amazing! David welcomed us very well and the apartment was exactly what we needed for our short stay in Paris. Only little downside is the squeaky bed. But apart from that everything was perfect and I would recommend it to anyone!

16600462,426851090,2019-03-22,84316032,Kristen,This apt is perfect location & absolutely everything I imagine of classic Parisian elegance! The building of the apartment is beautiful the furnishings are classic and the location couldn’t be better! Delicious cafes & pastry shops abound & you’re just 2 blocks from a metro! Also easy walking distance to major sites! 2 toilets really helped with getting ready! And we loved having a small kitchen to make coffee & tea in the morning. Highly recommend staying here!

En résumé une adresse idéale pour un séjour romantique et relaxant  nous n'hésiterons à y retourner lors d'un futur séjour à Paris.

1981461,73536171,2016-05-08,11410910,Dirk,"Die Wohnung ist hervorragend in unmittelbarer Nähe zu Panthéon und Jardin du Luxembourg gelegen. Auch wenn wir keinen persönlichen Kontakt zu Aurélien und seiner Familie hatten (sie waren während der Zeit verreist) hat die Kommunikation per sms sehr gut geklappt. Aurélien hat sich hervorragend gekümmert; zudem lagen auf dem Küchentisch weitere Informationen und eine nette Begrüßung bereit. Gefreut haben wir uns auch über die nette ""Erfrischung"" im Kühlschrank! Die Betten waren für uns hergerichtet und Handtücher lagen bereit. Alle vorhandenen technischen Geräte (Mac TV Kaffeemaschine Spülmaschine Waschmaschine ...) standen zu unserer Verfügung (auch wenn wir hiervon keinen oder nur kaum Gebrauch gemacht haben). Wir haben uns zu viert (2 Paare) sehr wohl gefühlt es hat an nichts gefehlt. Wir freuen uns dass Aurélien uns die von ihm und seiner Familie bewohnte Wohnung anvertraut hat. Ein Beleg für die außergewöhnliche Betreuung durch Aurélien ist auch seine Zusage zwei von uns in der Wohnung vergessene und für unsere Kinder bestimmte Mitbringsel per Post nachzusenden. Wir können die Wohnung nur weiterempfehlen und wünschen Aurélien dass er immer wieder auf Gäste trifft die seine Wohnung so zuvorkommend behandeln wie Aurélien seine Gäste. Encore un grand merci!"
35662911,513942619,2019-08-20,226360852,Fred,Localisation de l'appartement très bonne. Il faut savoir garder à l'esprit que celui ci est petit avec une douche uniquement pour la salle de bain et un équipement cuisine très restreint. L'espace étant limité une fois le lit ouvert il n'y a plus de salon et l'accès terrasse est un peu sportif. Cet appartement est atypique et charmant mais à ne pas sélectionner pour y passer du temps ou si vous cherchez du confort.

4004660,30956913,2015-04-29,351419,Mollie,"Gaspard is an amazing host and I highly recommend his listings to everyone visiting Paris looking for an elegant but affordable flat. The neighborhood is amazing (just south of Montmarte in the top of the 9th which has great food and bars etc) and the building itself is stunning quiet with great amenities.

Gaspard's attention to detail attentiveness to guests' needs and commitment to providing quality is admirable."

1315770,424761609,2019-03-17,188332066,Jimena,El depto se encuentra en una zona multicultural sinceramente por momentos puede parecer peligroso pero en sí no lo es. De hecho por las noches era un lugar tranquilo para andar y para descansar. Cercano a estaciones de tren y subte y de muy fácil acceso. El depto tiene una vista lejana pero hermosa a la torre Eiffel que enamora todas las noches.  Super espacioso y luminoso. Nuestro anfitrión nos ayudó con info turística de la ciudad y a pedir un taxi ya que nos fuimos por la madrugada. Gracias Dominique!
17665267,163601450,2017-06-25,132224156,Divya,Richard is extremely friendly kind funny and accommodating.

1036502,238642030,2018-02-26,111201319,Kathleen,What a gem!  Our family of 5 stayed at this wonderful home for a week. We loved every minute of it. It’s a few steps from great restaurants a few steps from the metro and  a supermarket . It’s a wonderfully fun and safe neighborhood but the home is really quiet. The home is well equipped with everything we could have wanted and comfortable. There are two elevators that are helpful as well.  Our whole family had such a great time and wished we could have stayed longer. We would definitely go back.

The location cannot be more central but the apartment is super quiet because it's set away from the busy street. Gerard who takes care of the unit was helpful and communicative. Great value for a good stay in Paris.

And the patio was such a nice extra space where we could relax outside and enjoy the plants and the birds singing. Carole herself was a great host giving us a lot of suggestions for things to do in the neighborhood and was very responsive. We really enjoyed our stay thank you Carole!
19975532,269987580,2018-05-28,167654775,Nicole,Great location! Just a few steps away from the subway and has a direct line to Gare du Nord which can come in handy for travellers like myself who wish to head out to nearby cities/countries. Lots of restaurants and bakeries nearby and most places are within walking distance. Place is small but cozy just as depicted in the picture. Perfect for solo traveller or a couple.

8679687,292057806,2018-07-17,121122076,John L,"If you'd like to stay in a great location in Paris at a great price this studio is a great option. It is very close to the Pyramides metro station and an easy walk to the Louvre and Palais Garnier Opera House. There are many many restaurants and other food choices nearby. 

We were there in the summer and it was warm outside but the little balcony is a great place to cool off and relax and the fan brings in the cool air especially at night making it nice and cool when you are sleeping. 

Keep in mind that the studio is up five flights of stair so if you have mobility issues this apartment might not be for you. 

Inger is very responsive and helpful. She saved us when I locked the keys inside the studio one day.

I highly recommend Inger and her studio."

Close to all you need... we even went for a beautiful morning run along the canal which is very closeby. Metros are close & can get you to everywhere you want/need to go. 
The apartment is compact; perfect for a couple & Benoit & Shiela were pleasures to deal with! And Benoit was always available for even the quirkiest questions :)
Highly recommended."
28729987,468254861,2019-06-12,38706482,David,Geraldine’s apartment is fantastic. It has all that you require and even though you are above a Rue de Belleville the modern shutter and window system completely blocks out the street sounds. It is a 3 minute walk away from the metro station Pyrénées that is 10-15 minutes from centre of Paris. The Belleville area is very cool lots of cafes bars good food and bakeries. The beautiful Parc de Belleville is a 15 minute stroll away if you need time out with nature in a large park enjoyed by the locals on weekends. Geraldine was available if needed and very helpful if help was required. Loved our 3 day stay and would definitely stay again when in Paris. Highly recommend.

The metro and the bus station Porte de Champerret are about 150 meters away so it is very comfortabele to get to all the touristic places in Paris. Arround there are some restaurants bars and also a little supermarket. 
So it was a nice stay to know Paris better. "

2567143,12514015,2014-05-04,10010228,Violaine,Logement très agréable et lumineux (4ème étage). Très propre. Très bonne insonorisation : on n'entend pas la rue ! Communication facile avec Stéphanie. Idéal pour un séjour en amoureux comme nous l'avons passé : à proximité de Montmartre à pied et très bien desservi par métro. Nous étions à 3 stations du parc Monceau (idem Batignolles) et avons pu aller courir le matin avant de revenir en nous baladant et de prendre le petit déjeuner sur le balcon. C'est une certitude si nous devons revenir dans ces conditions à Paris nous logerons chez Stéphanie

50677,11222980,2014-03-25,786291,Melinda,We had a great time in this lovely little apartment and it was like a quiet oasis in the bustle of the Marais. I easily develop back problems with saggy beds; this particular bed was a quality medium to hard mattress and immensely comfortable. We would easily stay there again. Perks: the grocery store just downstairs has everything we needed and the bakery a half block away was absolutely delicious - we went there 3 times daily for baguettes croissants pain au chocolat and other things. Mami was very helpful and responsive via text message hands off yet offering much helpful and personalized resources including restaurant recommendations that we appreciated. Thank you mami!

A 2 minute walk from the tube which is a short journey to anywhere in Paris but we ended up mostly walking only 40 mins or so to the Louvre. Would definitely recommend!

Near by subway station (2minutes) a lot of fancy restaurants and cafes sightseeings like orsay museum are located in the walking distance.

Host is very kind and cool.

Room is very clean cosy large enough for two men. Hot water oven heater and other electronic stuffs work well. Toilet is also clean and large.

매우추천하고 싶은 숙소입니다. 방은 매우 넓고 쇼파배드와 침대1개로 이루어져있습니다. 오븐이나 냉장고 등등 잘 갖추어져 있습니다.  난방이나 온수는 잘되어있고요.
호스트는 매우 친절합니다.
지하철역 에서 매우 가깝고 주변에 카페나 레스토랑이 많습니다. 치안 같은 경우 밤늦게 까지 다녀도 아무 걱정 없을정도로 안전합니다. 1층에 있어서 계단을 많이 안걸어도 괜찮습니다.
다시 파리에 방문하게 되면 다시 오고 싶은 숙소입니다."

221754,2339242,2012-09-18,2429370,Alexander,"Valerie is absolutely lovely and a very welcoming host. As others have mentioned she had a little welcome pack prepared for us with juice water tea and biscuits - a fabulous way to start the stay. 
The loft looks as pictured - it's funky rustic and looks gorgeous when lit with candles. The space is very big for paris and it is equiped with everything you would need for your stay. Brilliant wifi even a desk.The loft is very close to the metro and velib so has great transport options.

A couple of things to note - the curtains do not block out the light so bring an eye mask. There were children running around on the floor above and playing/screaming quite a bit outside as I think there is a school or a daycare on week days so bring ear plugs too if you like to sleep in.

The area directly around the loft is not the iconic paris of cafes and grand boulevards etc. This is a more urban Paris grittier cool and up and coming. However just a very short walk is the beautiful canal saint martin. and then you are in iconic Paris again. We would come back to enjoy valeries lovely hospitality and her romantic and unique loft again.

Thank you Valerie!"

침구 식기 따뜻한 물 등에 있어 아무 문제가 없었습니다. 꼭대기층에 주택가라 조용합니다.
에어컨이 없지만 선풍기를 준비해주었고 창문을 열고 선풍기를 켜니 시원했습니다. (39도 더위를 견딘 한국인이면 견딜 수 있음. 파리에서 덥다 덥다 한들 한국보다는 시원함)
소파 침대는 생각보다 괜찮습니다. 소파를 펼치면 스프링 매트리스가 나오는 구조입니다. (한국에서 흔히 떠올릴 수 있는 소파 침대 스타일은 아님)
호스트는 친구를 보내 체크인을 도와주었고 의사소통에 큰 어려움은 없었습니다.
좋은 숙소를 제공해준 호스트와는 별개로 이 동네에서 좋지 않은 일을 겪었습니다. 저와 일행이 길을 지나가다 눈도 마주친 적 없는 노숙자로부터 갑자기 물을 맞았기 때문입니다. 당신이 만만해보이기 쉬운 동양인이라면 이 동네를 신중하게 고민해보는 편이 좋을 것입니다. 하지만 호스트와 숙소에서의 경험은 매우 좋았습니다."

I stayed for 5 weeks at Julian's and have absolutely no complaints.  The flat was as represented. The host was gracious friendly and nice. There is a door to the bedroom to close so street noise does not affect sleeping. The location is fantastic. I was sad to leave. Thank you Julien.

We really liked all the additional tour guides about Paris and further recommendations provided by Eric in the apartment. Stuff for everyday life like towels shower gel etc were in the apartment and the bed was comfortable. The small but functional kitchen is a nice extra if you don’t want to go out for dinner. The metro station and supermarkets were really close by. We also went to a market only a street away which provided a lot of very cheap and excellent vegetables and fruits. Furthermore restaurants and bars are close by.

We enjoyed the multitude of choice in the area for brasseries boulangeries and epiceries. We especially the small street market on Tue Thu and Sat which we used to stock up on fruits and vegetables for home cooking. 

The apartment is not super ideal for small children as there are lots of small trinkets and breakable art pieces. But we enjoyed the stay very much and grew to love the location as home over our stay."

4378590,37602615,2015-07-08,14480032,Fiona,"Montmartre is my favourite district to live in as the area is peppered with little bakeries and shops all within a fifteen minutes walking distance.

Along the same street lies the famous La Grenier A Pain which has really good baguette (crispy on the exterior- you can really hear the crunch as you bite into it- and a relatively fluffy interior ) but what I love most is the croissant.

A very convenient district as it is also a walking distance to the famous Sacre Coeur (which is beautiful to visit at night) although the walk up the hill can be a discouraging (If you're carrying things or if you've been tired out from an entire day of walking).

The 6 flights of stairs to climb daily is really really exhausting though and can be difficult especially if you're coming with luggage but Thomas was a gem and helped with mine."

It’s in a down to earth but very Parisian part of town with a fantastic bakery and great local bars and restaurants just a few blocks away and any amenity you could need available right in the neighborhood - grocery stores pharmacy a cute little park and so close to a major metro stop! Her home was clean and large with plenty of room to relax after a day on our feet around town.

Jacques friend Jean Paul acted on Jaques behalf as he spoke excellent English and what a lovely and helpful man he was. He was able to be flexible with check in and check out times due to flight schedules which very kind. He answered all questions about how to get around the city and gave great advise. We were walking distance to Notre Dame and to some great restaurants. The apartment was clean and tidy with everything you could possibly need and it was also very secure and private. I cannot say enough good things about this apartment or how wonderful our hosts were.

Carole and George were very welcoming and helpful. Despite being in such a lively area the apartment is also very quiet and the bed is probably the most comfortable I've ever slept on. Thanks Carole and Georges!

The appartment was ideally located near Metro line 1 and 5 and was a perfect base for our Paris adventure. I would definitely recommend to any couples looking to stay in a stylish appartment in a trendy part of town.

15479532,181765496,2017-08-13,6916832,Syed,Excellent location! The apartment provided for a very comfortable stay for 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids). Although this apartment does not face the street the windows do face an large open air area providing enough light and air circulation. The place was clean and the bathroom was really well designed and spacious especially by European standards. There is a grocery store right downstairs a bakery around the corner and the metro stop also around the corner. We were able to walk to the Opera the Apple Store etc. very easily. As I said excellent location. One of the few buildings with an elevator though the apartment is only one floor up. The kitchen was also well equipped. Last but not least the communication was excellent which made a huge difference. Thank you and we will definitely use your apartment again during our next visit to Paris.

5923955,338711102,2018-10-20,5493615,Elena,"Провели прекрасную неделю в квартире Морган. Для тех кто любит современный стиль и вообще современные дома - наверное это не лучший вариант. Но огромный плюс и очарование этой квартиры именно в том что она в старом доме 18 века с полом тех времен и артистической атмосферой - книги альбомы картины. Очень светлая общая зона (кухня + гостиная) т.к. в ней имеется 3 больших окна в пол. Можно открыть окно поставить к нему столик с креслами и получится прямо как в парижском кафе - окна выходят на площадь с кафешками. Ночью не шумно а вечером очень приятно сидеть под уличный шум кафе. Есть отдельная спальня с удобной кроватью. Все удобства основные тоже имеются (кроме телевизора пожалуй - но он и не нужен) wifi работал прекрасно. Отдельно стоит обратить внимание что в доме нет лифта а квартира находится на 4 этаже.
Расположение идеальное - в пешей доступности основные достопримечательности прямо рядом - площадь Вогезов галерея Помпиду и набережная Сены со столиками на которых можно устраивать пикники.
Морган все прекрасно организовала была все время на связи. Отдельное большое спасибо за поздний  выезд в 14.00."

12146136,245181816,2018-03-21,160187829,Rob,The view is spectacular. We were there in March so it was too cold to use the balconies but it must be lovely in the summer.  We had three people which worked out fine. Sleeping was comfortable and the building is very quiet. The elevator is a big plus.  The neighborhood is nice with a lot of amenities close by. The show is a little tight but everything was clean and the water pressure was good. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

20912910,428451324,2019-03-25,11461996,Jimmy,This was a fabulous home away from home for our week in Paris. Perfect size for my mom daughter and myself. The location is so fantastic. Everything was clean and Dhirar was so helpful at check in and even videoing in at night when I couldn’t get the stove on! We felt very safe and we  loved this neighborhood.  Super easy to get to anywhere you would want to go.

If you don't have so much luggage it's a great place to stay ... 4th floor ... no elevator and get a taxi in Montmartre is difficult."

16036221,137535958,2017-03-16,17592260,Kevin,We had a pleasant stay at Guillaume's place. His apartment was near to the metro and RER which made commuting to and fro from the airport (and disneyland!) very convenient. Guillaume's apartment is very clean and tidy and the heaters installed will definitely keep you warm during the colder seasons. While we did not have a chance to meet with Guillaume he left perfect instructions for us to the apartment.
2177114,18545292,2014-08-28,7796280,Dianne,Fantastic location in a pedestrian part of Paris. So many shops and cafes jut around the corner and yet the apartment was so quiet. My 81 year old parents appreciated the elevator I was just as happy to use the steps! The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos with a good kitchen and space to relax. 
8716511,462375210,2019-06-02,16929680,Dayna,A great place to stay in a lovely neighbourhood. Nicolas was quick to respond to all questions. Kitchen was stocked and everything was ready for us when we arrived. Thank you for sharing your piece of Paris with us!

9582570,174914993,2017-07-27,88521331,Arianna,We absolutely loved our stay in Ivonne's home. The location was great. It is walking distance to so many nearby things & also to public transportation for further sights. Ivonne was so easily accessible day or night for any questions and concerns that we came up. This was our first time using Airbnb and she made it so comfortable for us. The space is very clean and well-equipped. She wasn't able to meet us herself as she was traveling as well but she had her nephew meet us and show us how to use all of the appliances in person & when we had a question that he was unable to answer he called Ivonne on video chat so that she could explain things better. She was absolutely a joy as a host & we would definitely stay with Ivonne again.

27353870,416841740,2019-02-25,216434793,Emily,"We had a lovely weekend staying in Yumi's apartment and would definitely recommend it highly.  Yumi was very quick to help when we could not connect to the WiFi or find the towels and was also kindly accommodating for our later check-out time.  It was very easy to speak with her and she gave clear directions for check in even though because of timing we were unable to meet in person.

The apartment is very stylishly decorated and feels light spacious and comfortable - the perfect size for a couple.  It was a pleasure to spend time there and is very close to the trendy and cultural areas around Sacre Coeur bars and restaurants and also transport such as buses and the metro.

We come to Paris regularly and it would be wonderful to stay in Yumi's apartment again!"

504964,13139233,2014-05-20,8668745,Dawn,"The ""little house"" is a tiny little loft nestled into a charming garden courtyard very quiet yet just steps from the very lively Canal St Martin.   The neighborhood is full of fun and interesting places to eat and shop with 2 excellent bakeries just around the corner.  The weather had suddenly warmed up so the mosquitos were voracious although Segire provided us with plug-in insect repellent and a fan. Also watch out for the very steep stairs up to the loft; they can be quite tricky if you need to get up during the night!

That said the listing is very accurate the bed is comfortable and the location simply can not be beat. Great value for a romp through Paris.

18643727,231243671,2018-01-31,7177386,Andrea,"The appartement is well located and clean.  Offers quiet and confort. Communication was easy but we had a problem that was not solved in time though we told Erick and his team 2 days before our departure. 
The shower does not work well. It was simply too hot to be able to shower. Erick and his team never came to fix it just gave us the same answer every time apparently there was a ""trick"" to make the shower colder but we tried what they told us and many other maneuvers with no luck.  We ended up never showering in the apartment. 
As I told the host a necessity as basic as showering should be a given and not depend upon a difficult or tricky device... 
Otherwise our experience would have been very satisfactory."
266725,484125501,2019-07-08,94714377,Tawnya,"Pierre’s apartment was the best place for us to stay in Paris. We are so grateful we got to spend a few nights in this perfect apartment!

Right up the hill from so much great food and drinking and walking distance to everything we also loved taking the nearby electric bikes down the hill into the city center.

The building is in beautiful condition and secure. The door woman is very helpful at showing you how to get in with the keys and takes the elevator with you to the 6th floor for the apartment.

The apartment is beautiful with a modern kitchen with all the necessities a beautiful sink window an incredible bathroom with a great shower a balcony with a view of the Eiffel and lots of Paris below and a very comfy living room and bedroom. We slept very well and couldn’t hear our neighbors at all. 

We are excited to someday come back to Paris and hopefully spend more nights in this beautiful apartment. Pierre was so communicative and helpful he even let us check in early and check out late. We can’t thank Pierre enough for such a wonderful stay.

Also! We suggest you get sandwiches from ale Grenier a Pain as much as possible! Merci!

1173475,23834180,2014-12-12,13428060,Jessica,"I want to be fair to this host but I will say that this wasn't my favorite experience.

Pros:
-Easily accessible check in and check out were a breeze
-Nicely located close to stores metros sights etc.
-Cheap
-Building was clean (even if the room wasn't)
-Elevator was a wonderful bonus
-Quiet especially for the lively neighborhood it's located in!
-Stocked with toiletries which was nice. 

Cons:
-Maybe we had an off stay but I don't think anything was cleaned before we arrived. The towel (singular) had makeup stains on it and the sheets had clearly been used before. On top of that the towel reeked of mildew like it had been put away wet. We ran to a store and purchased new towels and laundered the sheets at a laundromat so they were usable. I feel the previous Airbnb guests were not very tidy and the owner did not notice. 

-The apartment smelled of urine. We scrubbed the floor and area where it seemed to be coming from but couldn't get to the root problem. The problem was made worse by running the shower.

- The ""bed"" was not very comfortable.

Again I feel like maybe we just had an off weekend because the other reviews are so positive. I'd recommend this place for a younger single person for a night or two but for two adults it was too uncomfortable to spend multiple evenings. I understand that you get what you pay for though and take responsibility for booking a budget room. "
13179860,502070623,2019-08-04,164816506,Manon,Great appartement for a week-end getaway! Located right next to a metro station and a short walk from the Sacre coeur. Clean calm and cozy. Check-in and out were simple and our stay went great. Thank you very much!
11254716,84583537,2016-07-08,2836826,Pauline,Marthe's apartment has a great location very near Duroc metro station and bus stop for bus 39  etc. Around the corner is La Patisserie which has the best pastries I have ever tasted! It is in Arrondisement 6! Her detailed photos accurately present her place.  The bed on top is good for children- the adult can stay down.  It is a fantastic value. very safe and convenient. She was very helpful. Thank you for sharing your place Marthe. 
686459,11915389,2014-04-19,5038126,Sabi,I enjoyed my stay so much last time that I came back again when I needed a room in Paris. Lovely apartment with everything you could possibly need. Location is fantastic - in a safe area with lots of interesting cafes restaurants and shops. Dieywnaba is great too - always very quick at replying when I had any questions. 
1494097,158058201,2017-06-05,116119406,Danielle,Elodie is a wonderful host! She was super helpful with all of our questions. We couldn't have asked for a more accommodating host. The apartment is exactly as it's described. The apartment has a great central location!

32713910,436503206,2019-04-13,61411347,Andy,"The apartment itself consists of a bedroom a kitchen/living area and a bathroom.  The living area has a fold out sofa bed and the apartment was just right for our family of 4 and there was sufficient towels and bedding for all of us.

Although the meeting place is  Rue Grenelle 173 the apartment is actually across the road through a gateway and across a courtyard externally it didn't look so great but the apartment itself was clean enough and looks like it was recently refurbished. There's a note advising not to wear shoes in the apartment to avoid making undue noise when walking around which we adhered to but didn't get any complaints in fact as it's tucked away off the street the whole yard was fairly quiet. 

It's located just a minute walk from the shops and bars on Rue Cler and most importantly just over 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel tower.  It's also conveniently located for the metro and bus stops."

549226,87776031,2016-07-21,71065487,Phoebe,"Well We were not very Impressed with this place.
The room is in the 3rd floor. We had to drag our bags up very narrow wooden stairs. The room was ok as advertised with 2 single beds. The bathroom is so tiny we could hardly turn around. The house smells old and musky. The kitchen is like in a dungeon. We were expected to descent narrow concrete stairs to the kitchen.  It was nice enough and spacious when we got down there but it gave me a claustrophobic feeling. "
20024680,202686471,2017-10-12,295947,Rebecca,"WORST AIRBNB EXPERIENCE EVER! We booked via instant book the day before- we called and sent multiple messages regarding check in but were never able to get a hold of the host. So we arrived at check in time only to wait in the rain for 5 hrs until Airbnb customer service was finally able to contact the host who found a neighbor with a key. 
After things were finally sorted and we were settled in for a few days. The host's sister arrived at the door at 10:00pm yelling at us for not paying. I had been in communication with Airbnb multiple times since the whole ordeal and was told they reinstated the reservation and everything was fine. She was INCREDIBLY rude and hostile. Accusing me of trying not to pay and ignoring her and demanding I call Airbnb while she was waiting there. I kept telling her I was late for a dinner and had to leave but after being on hold forever and dealing with her (and missing the dinner) we packed our bags and left (a night early) bc we were afraid of what she would do with our things when she saw us go out. 
Even without the horrible host drama it wouldn't have been a pleasant experience. The apartment is tiny dark and filthy."

She was out of town but made sure somebody met us to show us the apartment and make sure we didn’t need anything else.  Highly recommend staying with Chloe if you can!
1133596,538900477,2019-09-30,113474791,Jane,Zazie is really an unbelievable hostess! She and her lovely home are just impeccable! Zazie is a most wonderful hostess. She is the kind of lady that has sunshine in her smile. She is an amazing woman elegant interesting and very very charming and caring. And she is a wonderful singer! One morning she sang and I danced in her lovely living room ! Just like the French fantasy I had in my dreams ! After the dancing she even made me delicious French lunch! And coffee was served with chocolate! I couldn’t have dreamed an even more romantic and better French experience or even an Airbnb experience ! And she sells gorgeous night gowns! Great quality with very reasonable price! Really great value ! Zazie was so romantic and considerate that she even added lavender oil on it for me ! She brought me to the park and invited me to drink wine with her husband. We had a such wonderful time ! She just really took care of me. When I needed to go to the pharmacy to buy shampoo and hair conditioner etc for my next stops of traveling she asked me not to buy certain items and told me she had extra at home which she could give me. She is really like family! Zazie is simply a wonderful person! And her place is just so elegant and beautiful and tasteful! I am so deeply deeply in love with Paris now and will definitely come back to Zazie’s place ! Thank you so much again dear Zazie!

14440907,194674543,2017-09-17,25540579,John,We had a wonderful time in Aurelie's apartment. Aurelie's friend Pierre was very helpful getting us settled in. The apartment was perfect for two. It was clean comfortable and really peaceful - it overlooks a garden and there is no street noise at all. The neighbourhood is very safe. We found several very good food shops just round the corner from the apartment and cooked some great meals in the little kitchen. Access to all of Paris is very easy with a metro station just at the bottom of the road and within walking distance of the apartment are many hidden gems such as the Botanic Gardens - free and open like a park - the natural History Museum the beautifully tiled 1920s Central Mosque The Pantheon and Rue Mouffetard with its pretty cafes and little restaurants. Many thanks to Aurelie!

10515799,111726165,2016-11-01,16409336,Jarrold,This house was one of the most beautiful and unique house I've ever stayed in. It totally made my Paris experience as we could see the Eiffel Tower from the roof window of one of the attic rooms and because the MontMartre neighbourhood is on a hill you can see a great distance from the roof windows. The house is well equipped and stunning with many vintage-looking furniture and appliance. I am so glad I got to book this apartment for my very first stay in Paris!

3584919,474463833,2019-06-23,242385718,Anya,You absolutely cannot beat the location of Judith's delightful rooftop apartment. You do need to be prepared to climb six flights of stairs each day but sitting out on the rooftop terrace watching the sunset and listening to the hum of the city from below is pretty hard to beat! Nova the cat is perhaps the friendliest most gorgeous cat we've ever met (and we are cat people!) and Judith had prepared an incredibly warm inviting welcome for us. We had an incredible stay here and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a home away from home in Paris.

Pero el departamento carece de mantenimiento y Julie atiende por teléfono pero no resuelve. Nunca nadie nos recibió ni vino a asistirnos con los inconvenientes.
Las fotos publicadas no son actuales:
No hay mesa para comer no hay cortina gris que tape el placard la mesada de la cocina está deteriorada encontramos el televisor roto una mesa ratona rota. Terminamos comiendo en una pequeña mesita que apenas alcanzaba para uno.
En fin con un poco de mantenimiento y dedicación estaría bien pero de ninguna manera vale hoy lo que se paga."
3509041,38474096,2015-07-16,22105497,Julia,This was a great apartment in a perfect location. It was full of interesting books and brochures about Paris and easy walking from all the 'hot spots'. The quality of everything was fantastic although it was a tad noisy because of being on the 1st floor (i.e. near traffic). But this mean it was easy to access. Highly recommend. 
31893,205184,2011-03-21,70372,Sophia,"My four friends and I traveled to Paris for the weekend and had a fantastic time staying in Clement's apartment. It was very spacious (could fit 6 easily) and clean with beautiful sunlight shining into the apartment at all times during the day. The subway was right on the corner of the street (1 min walk) and it was a quick ride (with minimal transfers) to all the important Parisian sights (as well as the airport).

Clement was a great host and made our trip very convenient providing us with guides and maps with local gems circled on it. They also laid out a welcome package for us in the kitchen which made 5 hungry college students very happy.

I would highly recommend staying at Clement's apartment and would do so again if I returned to Paris."

13723889,364233026,2018-12-30,22166828,Bradley,Wow! So grateful we booked our week stay in Paris with Alain. My partner and I were visiting Paris for the first time and this location made it SO easy to instantly access the Lourve Palais Royale metro shopping and restaurants. Can’t beat the location. We were also impressed with the size and style of the unit (exactly as photographed.) We considered nearby hotels but the beds were much smaller and the room was half the size as Alain’s place. The kitchen was well appointed the bathtub was surprisingly deep and great after a long day - and the bed was SO comfortable! Also his communication was perfect. Super prompt and very reliable. One note - it is very central so you can expect outside noise from street cleaning and other travelers but that’s to be expected for staying in the city and worth it for the great location. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
3517533,19685847,2014-09-16,17145746,Jolene,Chrystelle was a great and helpful host. The apartment was clean and nice. It was better than the pictures depicted. The location was also great as shopping was only a street away and the Arc too! Overall a great stay! 
4346793,87959264,2016-07-22,54760577,Claudia,Wow! That was our experience coming into this fabulous apartment. It was the apartment we had the fewest pictures of so we were a little apprehensive about renting it but we were so glad we did! It is gorgeous spacious and has TWO outdoor places to sit and have a glass of wine or whatever your pleasure may be. There are high ceilings with beautiful crown molding and lovely wood floors. It's in a wonderful part of Paris and was very comfortable. I would have loved to stay much longer and highly recommend booking this apartment.
1199991,43539192,2015-08-20,2043827,Stephanie,Marion was always willing to offer recommendations and guidance for exploring the city and the apartment itself was wonderful - a big private room very close to many things including Le Marais. The WiFi was also very fast which was nice for getting some work done and staying in touch with everyone in the US. Thanks Marion!

452481,5247138,2013-06-20,6493376,Maria,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Paris at the Charming bedroom on the roofs.  The room was advertised honestly and I can attest to some of the other reviewers remarks: provisions being left in the fridge to nibble on comfy pillows the fantastic proximity to the Metro stop which is a fantastic landmark if you're not used to navigating the streets of Paris which can be confusing.  Unfortunately I did not have a chance to meet with Nicole but someone was there to hand over the key and explain the routine of keys etc.  Nicole was very prompt in responding to my emails before I arrived and answered all my questions no matter how silly they may have seemed!  She even gave me instruction on how to get from Gare Nord to her flat and checked in with a message welcoming me to Paris which was very kind!  The room is functional cozy and well connected to anywhere you want to go in the city.  In fact the neighbourhood is quite nice to stroll through with a park very near by and lots of restaurants to choose from which is a nice reprieve from the hustle-bustle of the city centre.  I would recommend this accommodation and stay here again when I visit Paris again!

Also there is no TV. I know it's written on the description i just did not pay attention to it until i was there. Not that it was a big problem but it would have been nicer because we also have kids with us. 
There is a nice bakery just outside the apartment good if you're in a hurry for breakfast. 
Easy check in and out and good responses from the host. 
Thank you Matilde for our lovely stay :)"

6408964,67679837,2016-03-30,9923989,Magali,La coordination pour récupérer les clefs a été parfaite. L'appartement de Mélanie et Thomas est très propre (coup de coeur en particulier pour la salle de bain) et super bien situé dans un quartier de Montmartre pas touristique et peuplé de pleins de restaurants bars et commerces. L'appartement est aussi très calme car il donne sur une cour intérieure et non sur une rue passante. Parfait pour dormir! A refaire! 
37445404,549536672,2019-10-18,164797731,Nikhil,The place is centrally located. Very near to metro. The place is small and om fourth floor without lift but its worth at the given price. The host is very quick with the responses to the queries. Suitable for solo travellers with less luggage.

23233753,324973043,2018-09-18,66430269,Javier,El departamento es tal y como se ve en las fotos esta limpio y ordenado. Hay que tener en cuenta que es en el cuarto piso y no hay ascensor. La zona está muy bien aunque como es una zona popular hay mucho movimiento por las noches y se escucha mucho el ruido de motocicletas y personas fuera todo lo demás bien.

530246,8713835,2013-11-13,1395575,Rachael,"Pros:     The location is fantastic. It couldn't be better! Its only two blocks from the Eiffel Tower. You can see the top of the tower from the bedroom. The beds were comfortable and the shower is nice. There is much more room than a hotel. Nicolas was out of town so I dealt with James. He was very nice and very helpful. 
 (Website hidden by Airbnb) 
Cons:      The apartment smelled funny. Maybe it is just an old  apartment smell but we just couldn't seem to get over it. The kitchen was great but it would have been nice to have some kind of napkins or something and there was no bowls. 

Over all we had a wonderful time in Paris. The apartment was very close to restaurants the metro and grocery stores. This apartment added to our lovely Parisian experience! "
922561,4083332,2013-04-08,1220342,Julie,"Thezame is a warm responsive and charming host! She met us when we arrived quite late and gave us a tour of the apartment. 

The place is wonderful. Just as pictured with 2 bedrooms at the back of the building overlooking the charming cobblestone alley. Big windows and lots of light in the bedrooms but dark curtains can be pulled if you want it dark and cosy. The beds are very comfortable. However the daybed in the living room is less so given the thin cushion. Linens and pillows fresh and comfy. 

The flat is large and the kitchen well-equipped. Wifi worked well and there is a desk to work at. It was a pleasure to be enveloped by Thezame's objects collages and wordplay. My 2 friends and I had a fabulous time. Thanks Thezame!"

We heard that this was a much better option than hotels in Paris and it was an excellent choice.  Great location very modern clean bright and roomy.  It made our first time in Paris enjoyable easy and comfortable.  Penelope was very professional and easy to work with.  Highly recommend!

2101196,124098303,2017-01-01,92740110,Lorraine,Le quartier est extraordinaire! L'appartement est spacieux tres calme et tres bien équipé. La deco est sympa comme sur les photos et il est tres propre. C'est très pratique d'être au rez-de-chaussée de chaussée avec les valises. Comme d'autres voyageurs l'ont dit le canapé lit dans le salon n'est pas très confortable et il n'y a pas de volets ni de rideaux occultant dans le salon donc si on a besoin de l'obscurité totale pour dormir il vaut mieux éviter le salon. La chambre en revanche est très bien (obscurité et bon lit). Donc parfait pour un couple ou un couple avec des enfants qui ne sont pas génés par le manque d'obscurité.

33501332,544413427,2019-10-10,232081654,Mariette,Frederic’s apartment is right behind Sacré-Cœur very close to restaurants and fabric stores. His apartment is perfect for students or people who are very adjustable with small spaces. I personally didn’t have any problem with the apartment except the one time there wasn’t water running from any taps for more than half a day later realized it was a problem with the whole building and not just my apartment.( which was fixed) Frederic is very sweet and kind.

Le parking est un vrai plus lorsque l'on vient en voiture. Merci pour l'accueil très ponctuel. On se sent comme chez soi c'est très agréable. 
6473734,320785035,2018-09-09,4694060,Julie,"What a perfect spot! My spouse and I stayed for 8 nights in Claude's home. It's exactly as pictured--a Parisian home. We had coffee and pastries on the balcony each morning. We slept peacefully in the quiet space every night. We enjoyed the carefully collected art on the walls.

Claude's home is in a wonderful location close to restaurants (we liked Cafe des Musees) shops (check out Divvino) the St. Paul and Chemin Vert Metro stations and museums (Picasso around the corner). There are two parks on the block and three cafes for coffee pastries and aperos. 

The best part about Claude's home is the hostess. Claude greeted us at the door despite an earlier-than-expected arrival. She gave us the history of the building and neighborhood where she lives. There's a folder of her favorite neighborhood spots and book about important buildings to read. We chatted about museums food urban planning and our families. I can't wait to go back to Paris and when I do I'll look forward to staying with Claude!"

11522022,183676967,2017-08-18,109395017,Cara,"Delphine's apartment is absolutely the best for large groups!  The apartment is truly stunning and very spacious and inviting.  There were 7 adults when we stayed and there was plenty of room for all of us (5 bedrooms and 3 full baths).  The kitchen is also very well-stocked with supplies which is great because we cooked here a few nights after some trips to the markets down the street.  There is plenty of comfortable space to just relax in the light-filled apartment (since the apartment is on the 6th floor with windows all around the light just streams in).  

The location is very convenient for sightseeing and the neighborhood is safe clean and quiet in the evenings.  There are lots of great shops markets cafes and restaurants all around the neighborhood.  I highly recommend walking down to the markets for fresh fruits veggies cheeses and meats!  We all walked to most tourist sites (we put on probably 6-10 miles a day) but the metro at the end of the street is convenient for longer trips.  We were also there to attend a conference and the apartment is an easy 15 minute walk to the conference center.  

Delphine was wonderful and kept in communication with us the entire time. She is perfectly fluent in English (helpful for me!).   When we needed anything she responded immediately.  She also put together a book for the apartment (including where to shop and eat) which is super helpful.  

I can't recommend this apartment enough.  I felt like I was able to experience Paris more like a Parisian in this beautiful apartment!"

15184330,132171131,2017-02-16,46482625,Fabrice,"L’appartement est plutôt agréable calme et dans un quartier sympa mais notre séjour a été gâché à notre arrivée par l’état de l’appartement : draps sales moutons de poussière au sol bac de douche crasseux. Nous n’avons pas été accueillis par le propriétaire mais par  la personne en charge de l’entretien qui ne parlait pas français ce qui ne facilite pas les échanges. Après son départ quand nous nous sommes rendu compte de la saleté générale nous avons tenté de joindre le propriétaire surtout pour les draps qui avaient encore des traces d’utilisation (traces jaunes de crasse sur les taies d’oreiller draps avec les marques des corps odeur désagréable  présence de poils et cheveux) mais aucune réponse immédiate. En attendant nous avons pris des photos et nous avons tenté de faire le ménage dans tout l’appartement avec l’aspirateur dont le réservoir était plein de poussière et le peu de produit ménager présent.  Impossible de nettoyer le sol il n’y avait pas de serpillère. Depuis combien de temps le sol n’a-t-il pas été lavé ? En outre il n’y avait même pas de savon ni de papier toilette ce qui est la moindre des choses surtout quand c’est précisé dans l’annonce. Au final nous avons dû nous coucher ainsi que nos 2 petites filles dans des draps sales ce qui nous a vraiment dégoutés. Et le téléphone a bipé à minuit avec un message du propriétaire qui nous certifiait que le ménage avait été fait mais qu’il serait refait le lendemain… Le soir du deuxième jour nous avons eu enfin le plaisir de rentrer dans un appartement propre pour passer une deuxième nuit meilleure que la précédente. Mais il n’est pas admissible d’être obligés de dormir dans les mêmes draps que des inconnus et d’insister pour que le minimum soit fait quand on paie pour être logés!
Cette première expérience Airbnb n’est pas positive du tout. Nous ne vous ferons pas de la publicité.

20588104,293824679,2018-07-21,22232703,Christine,Great place and comfortable to stay in. Location is near to Eiffel Tower and to the Restaurants and the host replies questions fast. 
17818885,360969007,2018-12-22,48556281,Ben,Myriam’s flat is in a perfect location to explore Paris and is equipped with great WiFi a good space heater and coffee machine. We were let down by the bed (advertised as a queen but is really two single mattresses pushed together - uncomfortable to say the least) and general hygiene (we found some dirty underwear as well as some out of date food in the fridge - simply over looked I guess and not really a big issue for us but not great really). Having said this we had a great time as we could be at all the main attractions in Paris within 30 minutes and Myriam was very fast at responding to our questions. She was very apologetic about the hygiene issue we had and offered us some money off our stay. Overall a lovely host with a space that could be perfect with a couple of little tweaks - Thank you Myriam.
35223802,532720305,2019-09-20,71099064,Ni,Eric’s place is exactly like the pictures posted. It’s clean bright and at a very good location (3min walk to a subway station and 10min walk to a major train station). We had 3 adults and 2 young kids and we were very comfortable there. Eric was very nice friendly responsive too. Though the unit is on the 5th floor we didn’t have a problem not even my 3 year old! :) Highly recommended!
497821,219271600,2017-12-17,2899641,Tim,The apartment is relatively large and in a great location. Quiet safe and well connected. The place is well equipped but sort of reminded me of an old lady’s appartement (which of course might be to the liking of some guests). Overall too much clutter. We also had a problem with the cleanliness of the place. Maybe the cleaner had a bad day at the time. With a makeover this could easily become a 5 star property. Anyway no complaints about outback communication with Stan and his dad.
20963007,435038755,2019-04-09,19556171,Shaina,I had a wonderful stay at Lyne’s home. The room was very comfortable and clean.

I highly recommend!
1888069,32578947,2015-05-19,12326206,Daniel,Charming home from home. Ideal for us and our 3- and 1-year old little ones. To give you an idea of what a good host she was Celine put out children's towels for us. Great area great local tips too (Le faitout was a fun eccentric place for dinner).

Ci sono tanti negozi di eccellenze gastronomiche tutti intorno e persino il mercato di mercoledì e sabato.  La proprietaria è molto gentile e disponibile e ci ha accolto personalmente per il check-in. Nell'appartamento siamo stati comodi in tre per una settimana perché è una casa dotata di tutto ciò che può servire.

Dentro o apartamento também foi bom embora o fato da cama ser no chão e se localizar num quinto andar sem elevador torne mais penosa a estadia para pessoas mais velhas como era o nosso caso.

14611827,367201031,2019-01-04,3101648,Anine,"This is an outstanding condo in the most amazing location in the 5th. We enjoyed the beautiful home and all its character and ammenities. 
Amandine and Catherine were easy to communicate with and always available. They did help with us finding a sitter who spoke English also and we received great recommendations. 
We brought our kids 2 & 4 and that worked well but I do not recommend people with mobility issues to stay here or very young kids who are mobile but not established walkers yet due to the layout of the home. 
I would love to return to this home and location."
1205252,455014791,2019-05-19,250561163,Larry,Armand's Father speaks English but was not home most of my stay. Marie is very very nice home made jams and she printed out a couple simple maps for me to walk to the river/islands as I wanted to ride one of the River Boat Cruise/Tours.  1 hour for the one I took from in front of the Eifle Tower but I took the Hop on Hop off Bus to get there. They do not announch stops so you need to figure out ahead of time where you want to get off never being to Paris before was not their problem but need a lot of research if going there and never been and at least have and practice using Translation on your phone ahead of time.

Its on the 7th floor with no elevator and in summer it can be a little hot but there was a small AC and you can leave the windows open at night.  It was clean and everything like he described it in his infos. Also the communication with Nicolas was fast and easy. 

We can definitly recommend his place! He is a very nice host and his home is adorable.

Nous venions pour un séjour professionnel et la proximité de la gare rer des Halles était l’un de nos critères pour choisir cet appartement situé dans un quartier que nous apprécions.
Notre arrivée s’est parfaitement déroulée et si ce logement avait été libre en janvier prochain ( dommage...)nous y serions revenus avec plaisir"
5885778,102231938,2016-09-17,90325524,Susan,The directions to access the apartment were very good. They were detailed and we did not have a problem with the building codes or anything like that. The lift is VERY small and we only used it once when we first arrived to bring up our heavier luggage. The apartment was  clean and just as pictured. It was so much better to stay here than in a regular hotel room because of the kitchen. It is small but served our purposes fully. We were able to go to the grocery store and prepare and eat food at the apt in order to save money on eating out during out stay.

The apartment was also as specified a great place right in the center of the city. Lovely decor and quite spacious for Paris and a great location right next to the Opera and many other city landmarks.
We had a great experience recommended.

14893547,535798766,2019-09-25,13717265,Sarah,Remy's place was as advertised - great location for all you would want to see and do in Paris Remy is super responsive and the place is spotless. It's a perfect fit for a couple looking to stay in Paris. There's only two things that I would be aware of when booking here which is the noise outside can be quite loud on weekend nights. We ended up sleeping with noise cancelling headphones on so it wasn't a huge issue overall. Second even though it was September it was quite warm with the windows closed and the covers. With the windows open though it made the noise worse.

The apartment is gorgeous and very spacious. There are small balconies which are a great little place to enjoy some coffee or wine. The bed was comfortable and we really liked the separate shower room. The neighborhood was fantastic--metro was super close or you could easily walk anywhere as well. Would definitely return

23484805,403968801,2019-01-22,2256301,Emily,"We were very excited to visit Paris and stay at the House on the Roof based on the images on Airbnb. While the apartment is gorgeous and designed very well there were a few items that are worth noting. Luckily Benoit was very responsive for everything during our stay and did his best to help us. 

- Apt does is not equipped for ""winter""; we visited during a particularly cold weekend in Paris and the heat in the apartment automatically turns off after one hour so the apartment never got fully warm. 
- Apt does not have extra blankets/pillows (this exacerbated the low heat issue)
- There are 4 flights of stairs (elevator is under construction...)
- Shower hot water ran out 2x (there were three of us; while we were told the tank held 150 L for three people to take a quick shower this was not enough.)
- The power went out twice (it was unclear why this happened we didn't have anything extra turned on or inl't electronics plugged in outside of a laptop with a converter) 

Overall: We would recommend this location to others who want a fashionable place to stay in a good area of Paris. Given it's a glass house on the roof it is much better suited for an early Fall/late Spring stay so you can appreciate the weather and probably will not need to deal with amenities in the apartment related to hot/cold weather."
1586457,252821800,2018-04-12,160706806,Fernanda,A localização desse apartamento é excelente – é muito legal sair e dar praticamente de cara com a torre Eiffel!

7725395,554926700,2019-10-27,28228694,Alexandra,Communication and checking in was very easy. Unfortunately Guillaume only spoke French and his partner who was there didn’t seem to be able to explain the things in English to us. They have six cats and the flat smelled of it as well. The room itself was clean but the bathroom wasn’t very clean. The location of the flat was excellent though. Only a 15 minute walk from the train station.
3476877,60791332,2016-01-27,6261620,Carla,Florent was really helpful and kind. He recommend us a few restaurants near the neighborhood that were great! Florent's house was nicely decorated. The neighborhood it's well located to walk to Notre Dame and the Louvre. For longer distances we took the subway which is really close to the apartment. Lot of bistros brasseries supermarkets and cafes were available close too. As a few previous comments said please note that this is a 6th floor without elevator and also a kids school is next to the apartment. We loved our stay in Paris at this flat and Florent was a great host.

771414,15624163,2014-07-13,14728100,Chiara,Per chi non conosce le dimensioni medie degli alloggi per studenti in Francia questo posto può rivelarsi una grossa delusione. In pochi metri quadri i francesi ci fanno stare di tutto compreso un patio che se dalla foto sembrava utilizzabile nella realtá era un buco con un pezzettino di cielo in alto. In compenso Victor é un caro ragazzo molto disponibile (ci ha cambiato immediatamente il materassino gonfiabile bucato) e il posto vicino alla metro e al Sacro Cuore (ci si arrivava a piedi in dieci minuti) ha un buon rapporto qualitá-prezzo.

The location is amazing and right in the heart of Paris. Everything you need is close to you including a taxi rank and the metro station nearby.

Rodwan is an excellent host and answered all our messages promptly.

Highly recommend for the location and hospitality from the host. The small apartment has all the necessities however the walls are quite thin and you can often hear neighbours coming in/out or walking around their room above you.

If you are a light and early sleeper I probably would not suggest this room.

Otherwise that was the only issue. Thank you Rodwan! Your home is beautiful and you made the checking in/out experience very easy for us.

Kind Regards

3398842,126730430,2017-01-14,77595614,Fernando,My experience at Pierre's place was more than expected. The location is super great as you can easily go anywhere in downtown Paris by bus or metro even there are so many lively places by walk distance so many cafes restaurants stores and groceries stores around whatever you would need. All the facilities into the apartment are quite well. Pierre transforms his living room in a comfy and spacious room where you can relax after an exhausted day exploring Paris. He is also very welcoming and friendly and very respectful in everything. Definitely Pierre's place is a top option highly recommended!

Easy access by using door codes so no need to worry about keys. No noise from neighbor and very little from the street in the morning. The apartment is very bright and clean with modern design.  Beautiful view from balcony. Elevator is tiny but looks new.  One suggestion is to add the wine glasses although water glasses still worked ok with our wine!  We love the apartment very much! Thanks Umberto!

We really felt like a local in Paris. There are 3 metro stations and many bus stations near her place so we went around Paris with ease. Sarah is also easy to talk to. Thank you Sarah!

4911410,146260792,2017-04-22,6069127,Andreas,"We rented Patricia's lovely apartment for four nights and with 4 adults and one child. Its is arranged with tasteful and functional furniture in good shape. The kitchen is well equipped. The bath is relatively small but offers a large enough shower. Consumable items (like shower gel soap toilet paper etc.) were provided. The beds are comfortable. The bedrooms provide lots of storage room. The living room is spacious and bright. The «view» into the courtyard is worth of improvement. The location is very good for exploring the wonderful city. Although we never met the host Patricia she was a very pleasant host. She provided valuable tipps communicated perfectly responded fast and offered her help every day of our stay. 

We had a wonderful time exploring the city and felt happy and at home at Patricias place."

The studio is literally right next door to some great food and nightlife. Jerome was very easy to reach and check-in/check-out was quick and easy. All the necessities were provided including sheets towels pillows comforters (super comfy) blow drier soap detergent etc. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Paris.

It was unusually hot the day we arrived and Catherina went out of her way and bought us a fan and even offered up her own place for us to stay if it was truly unbearable. She was very accommodating and we enjoyed meeting her for coffee on our last day. We would definitely stay here again. "

Thanks a lot for agreeing to check us in around midnight - that was very helpful. One suggestion - would be very good to leave a few basic food amenities like coffee pods bread and milk for the guests. Almost everyone appreciates a nice coffee and simple bread at the least: we would have liked having coffee pods at the least.

29878394,463916045,2019-06-04,86817738,Charlie,"This place was super clean and had amazing amenities. We brought our family and the apartment was great for all four of us. It’s fairly close to metro and bus routes and a great price for Paris. 

The neighbors were a little loud (not sure if they were loud or just thin walls) and the apartment is a little far from most of the main Paris attractions but if your away from the apartment all day it doesn’t matter."
19306,15027180,2014-07-01,12315709,Amanda,"I cannot fault Dominique for her communications tips and advice. We found the apartment with relative ease thanks to her clear instructions and it was everything we hoped it would be. Dominique has thought of everything and though the apartment is not enormous it is extremely well thought out and there is plenty of space for a couple. All the equipment you could need is thoughtfully provided. It really was a home from home for us as there are several things in the apartment that we have in our own house! Immaculately clean apartment and beautiful crisp bedding and towels (and that comes from a bit of a clean freak). 
We enjoyed the area as you truly feel you are in 'real Paris' rather than the crowded tourist streets of other areas. A great boulangerie right on the corner and supermarkets and cafes close by make eating in or out very pleasant and easy.
After walking for hours sightseeing in this beautiful city it was great to come 'home' to La Maisonette to relax unwind and have a peacefull night's sleep.
A few 'must-do' tips from us: 
Wander and shop at Rue Mouffetard market. Spend time on the Seine at sunset. Take a break at the local mosque for mint tea and delicious cakes. Eat Bertillon ice-cream on Ille St Louis. Relax in the Jardin du Luxembourg with a picnic or at the cafe. Have lunch at Musee du Quai Branley and Musee D'orsay (superb cafe food). Wander for hours taking in the majesty of the palaces and stunning buildings.
Enjoy...we did (despite the rain!).

868765,12478645,2014-05-03,14671499,Seleko,"We were extremely charmed by Mathilde and Jean-Pierre's apartment and most of all by their hospitality. They gave us enough privacy but also helped us with cinemas theatres art galleries and museums in Paris. We loved the architectural flair of the apartment and also the proximity to the cultural highlights of the city. This was definitely the Paris of Theatres and nightclubs and we will definitely stay there again!

Está ubicado a una cuadra de la estación del metro Cambronne  la cual te conecta con las demás líneas  incluyendo  el tren y aeropuertos . (CDG a 40 minutos ).

11983281,161723283,2017-06-18,92082894,Vishnu Priya,A calm and quiet place accessible to all the main sights. The location was suitable for us though it had 30-40 minutes of travel to the Eiffel tower. The tram stop is nearby and the place is well connected.  The place was very clean we found Gerald to be a friendly host ready to help and he provided us useful suggestions about roaming around Paris.  Communication was easy as Gerlad spoke good English. So overall I recommend Gerald's place for travellers looking for a friendly host and wouldn't mind a bit of extra travel.
3509041,369101761,2019-01-09,27806447,Camy & John,Love love love this apartment. So tasteful warm and welcoming. Third stay I think as we pass through Paris often and get it when available. The location for us is superb. A little noise in the bedroom for a few minutes in the morning when the waste management crews clean up — it’s our alarm clock to get up à embrasser la cité. You may protest as the bed is very comfortable.  The kitchen is well equipped and there is seating for 2 at the bar.

2225802,493848452,2019-07-23,245138585,João Vicente,O apartamento tem excelente localização e é realmente perto de tudo o que precisamos. O metrô fica exatamente na entrada do edifício. A sala e a cozinha são muito bem equipadas e confortáveis. O terraço é lindo e agradável. O local é silencioso e seguro. Os quartos tem vista bonita e tamanho de médio a pequeno. A cama de um dos quartos é pequena para pessoas com 170 m (5’7”) ou mais. O banheiro é ótimo e moderno porém a água do chuveiro deixou de esquentar no final e tomamos banho gelado nos últimos 5 dias de um total de 13. A anfitriã Jenny prepara o apartamento com cuidado e deixa tudo pronto para nos atender bem. Responde às solicitações sempre de imediato e nos ajuda e orienta quando precisamos incluindo emergências. Fala inglês com dificuldades.
11146075,290387875,2018-07-14,179322284,Karl,"Das Apartment liegt in einem kleinen belebten und sehr schönem Viertel von Paris. Mit der U-Bahn lassen sich alle Sehenswürdigkeiten in Paris in mindestens 30 Minuten erreichen. Direkt neben dem Apartment befindet sich ein kleiner gut ausgestatteter Supermarkt. Außerdem gibt es in unmittelbarer Nähe tolle Cafés und Restaurants. 
Man merkt dass die Wohnung wenn sie nicht vermietet wird wirklich von der Gastgeberin bewohnt wird. Deswegen ist die Ausstattung perfekt (Kühlschrank Waschmaschine Trockner Fernseher Kochbücher Geschirr Wasserkocher Gewürze Öl Toilettenpapier Seife) und die Gestaltung der Wohung viel liebevoller als andere Airbnb Apartments. Man fühlt sich sofort zu Hause! 
Die Kommunikation war immer schnell und unkompliziert und der Empfang beim Check-In war sehr herzlich und nett.
Wir können die Wohnung jedem empfehlen und würden jederzeit wiederkommen!"

Check-in is easy with the excellent instructions Chris provided. The apartment is very clean and modern with coffee maker microwave and excellent wifi. The downstairs bedroom is very quiet for a good night's rest. The location is perfect for exploring all of Paris as it's just across from a Metro station and the bus stops for several different lines. Chris is an excellent communicator and always responds quickly via email to questions or concerns. We would stay here again without any reservations.

23067540,316457698,2018-08-31,211655379,Joshua,Jon’s place located in in the heart of Le Marais the street where Jon’s apartment located is safe and sound too. It’s a small room though if you’re lone traveler need a place on your own just like what I did this is one of the best room you can find. Jon’s respond was quick too I made my booking just the night before my arrival. If you’re looking for the fast respond host Jon is your guy.

Si tenes ganas de conversar ella estará ahí  Si no será muy respetuosa de tus espacios.  Si quieres información de París donde ir como llegar está siempre dispuesta a explicar todo lo necesario. El día de la llegada nos recibió de una manera muy cálida y la mañana de la salida superó todas mis expectativas preparando un exquisito desayuno y levantándose temprano para despedirnos!!! Fueron tantas cosas buenas que tendría que escribir un libro.... como conclusión : hay que ir a París  pero sobre todo hay que ir a la casa de Annie  conocerás París de la mejor manera.

5523769,160695633,2017-06-15,79350703,Emma,A small cosy apartment but with all the amenities required. It is not a very central and tourist-filled area so you get more of a feel of the Parisian lifestyle yet it is situated a few minutes walk from the metro station so it's easy to get around Paris. Alexis was a lovely host and it was easy to get in contact with him. Overall a really lovely place I would definitely say that it's good value for money. Thank you for letting us stay in your apartment we had a great time in this amazing city.

The place was larger than I imagined. It was clean and the location couldn't be better. Definitely will stay at her place again if I am going back to Paris."

Alexandre si è dimostrata una persona onesta e pronta ad offrire una soluzione qualora se ne abbia la necessità. Altamente consigliato ci torneremo volentieri al nostro prossimo viaggio a Parigi. 
Apartment well located e spacious also for four people. There was all that we need inside the house. It was a great experience to live there and a plaseaure to meet a host like Alexandre."

5779606,452880326,2019-05-14,220418241,Wendy,Chantal’s apartment is delightful!  It was clean but not sterile - meaning that it felt like a home and not a hotel room.  It was spacious.  Though I was traveling solo there was plenty of space for two with a large living room area and double sinks in the bathroom.  The shower was nice and hot .  I liked that there were two entrances to the apartment as one was a very short walk to the Metro.  Chantal will let you know that there is a grocery and a patisserie right across the street which I found to be very convenient.  Most of all I loved the light and the artistic touches around the apartment that made it such a unique stay.
31757460,493788689,2019-07-23,112546515,Katiussa,A localização é excelente. Próximo ao metrô supermercados restaurantes farmácia. O bairro é agradável e seguro.

No geral atendeu muito bem as nossas demandas.

27888806,431548800,2019-04-01,77072515,Ashish,Great place located in central Paris. Close to Gare du Nord  station ( for Eurostar travellers). Apartment has a good vibe close to a supermarket ( if you want to cook). Has the basic amenities you need. Suitable for group of  2 - 4 people. The small critique would be no lifts and apartment is on 3rd floor so expect to carry luggage upstairs manually.

11115973,188125180,2017-08-28,11145432,Brittany,Jerome is a great host and the apartment is super cute and in a great location. Jerome allowed me to re-schedule our trip and gave me a discount after I had surgery and had to cancel. He met us at nearly midnight to welcome us to the studio and he gave us a late check-out as our train did not leave until 20:00. I would definitely stay again. Great time. Great host.

It is basic but charming and has all that you need when visiting Paris.  There are stairs and they are quite beautiful.  I recommend his place for  anyone who wants to be in Oberkampf near the lovely restaurants and bars.  It is also very convenient for visiting  the Picasso Museum and the Center de Pompidou.  We enjoyed our stay!!

He was there to greet us and give us lots of tips and suggestions when we arrived and was very easy to communicate with always prompt and helpful. He even graciously came and opened our door for us when we’d already done an early checkout but hat forgotten something. Theapartment has everything you need was very clean is set up in a very efficient way and my daughter and I were very comfortable staying there. The neighborhood has lots of different restaurants and shops the metro is nearby and it a place I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend to a friend.
8431476,319652647,2018-09-07,19866706,Chakanaka,"This apartment is fair sized (for Paris) has an antique feel and is good value for money especially if you are travelling on a budget. The apartment was clean and all the necessary amenities were present (including Wifi a stove microwave kettle etc). 

The exterior and parts of the interior of the building need some maintenance however the location is great: at the edge of Montmatre walking distance to Le Sacre Couer Musee de Montmatre numerous cafes and underground train stations (to take you to various sites).

There are stairs leading up to the apartment the host helped us carry our bags up when we arrived - which was great.

The host was also very helpful in providing us tips about how to use transit where to site see shopping etc."

The access was a bit difficult because the apartment is on the 4th floor without elevator. The only negative thing for me was the lack of ventilation in the toilet and the shower room and the fact that you had to walk though the toilet to access the second bed (up to the loft-above the toilet)
Delphine was pretty accurate about the house and very helpful with us ! Totally recommend!!"

She goes above and beyond to offer suggestions  make people feel welcome and answers questions thoughtfully.  We travelled with our 10 month old son and we couldn’t ask for better accommodations.  Worth every penny!

4139481,48198491,2015-09-24,42079570,Erin,"Thierry's flat was perfect for my short trip to Paris!  The flat has everything you need and more! What a great central location; Rue Rambatue is filled with great shops and cafes and is literally at the Pompidou. I prefer walking which I did most everywhere (many major attractions are within 10-15 minutes) but there is also a metro station at the corner of his block if you prefer.  

The area is extremely safe.  Many nights I walked around alone late at night.  The apartment is also very quiet for Paris which was really a luxury to come back to after a long day.  Definitely recommend this flat and will stay again when I am back in Paris!"

6360244,546802203,2019-10-14,235166457,Chrs,"Kleine Wohnung in einer gut belebten Passage. Mitten in Paris sehr gute Anbindung an die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel. Sehr Zentral! Einkaufsmöglichkeiten im direkten Umfeld Restaurants genügend vorhanden. Der Check-In hat hervorragend geklappt und wir konnten deutlich früher in die Wohnung!

Leider waren die Ausrüstungsgegenstände (Teller Besteck etc.) verschmutzt oder konnten zumindest ohne Reinigung nicht verwendet werden. Die Wohnung ist sehr hellhörig sowohl innen als auch von außen was die Nacht anstrengend machte (Fenster öffnen war aufgrund der Lautstärke nicht drin).

Im großen und ganzen waren wir dennoch zufrieden und wir würden die Wohnung für Partygänger und Nachteulen definitiv weiterempfehlen! Für einen gemütlichen Entspannungsurlaub in Paris würde ich aber eher was anderes wählen!

Vielen Dank nochmal!"

Room was really nice! Very nice location and extremely cozy. It was such a nice place to return to after a day of exploring. My friend who lived in a hotel not far away even preferred to come over and chill a little bit before going back to his hotel. Would definitely recommend.

The only thing to point out was the mattress had a little bit of smell. Other than that the room is exactly as described and very comfy!"

We happened to come when the temperatures were 109/110 degrees F and we desperately wished for air conditioning.  The nights were brutally hot.  Overall we would definitely recommend this for a couple or a family of 3.
6787788,215366184,2017-11-29,13198213,Claire,Teddy est un hote tres sympathique et disponible. Le studio est très bien placé pour un voyageur comme moi venant travailler au parc de la villette juste une rue à traverser. Il est également tout proche du métro pour rejoindre des sites touristiques ou shopping comme Opera. Le logement est très propre et avec toutes les commodités.

4089644,50726722,2015-10-13,29158647,Rebecca,Marines flat is a good base to explore the area.  I found it to be a quiet and cute place.  The neighborhood has lots of cafes and nightlife and I felt safe walking by myself at night and it's a few minutes out the door to a metro station.  Marine was easy to communicate with from start to finish.

Everything you could want is in the apartment and it's quaint and charming. Perfect for our group of three!

Pierre is super nice and always willing to help. The apartment is lovely and clean and most important the location is great. There is supermarket only 2 minutes away and metro station 4 minutes away. Cafes and restaurants are also available by foot. We would definitely recommend this room to our friends who wants to visit Paris.

Nico was very welcomming and helpful not only when we arrived but during the week when we needed help with directions or recommendations. Nico even printed a last minute online ticket purchase and brought it over. He allowed us to go into the apartment early as it was free and we left our bags for an hour at the end. We loved it here and Nico care assistance and apartment was a big part in our trip to Paris being fabulous.  Great location could be hot in peak summer even with a bedroom fan. Thank you Nico.

The bed is very comfortable and the room is very warm in the winter and there is absolutely no noise day or night. There is tea and coffee a microwave that is also a grill and steamer fridge and the necessary kitchen supplies mugs spoon plates bowls forks etc. The bathroom is beautiful in antique style and you can even take a relaxing warm bath.

Cathy a été très arrangeante pour la remise des clés merci encore! Rien à redire concernant la conformité à l'annonce sauf peut être le petit-déjeuner que nous n'avons pas eu mais sûrement dû à notre départ assez tôt le matin (7h30).

21282,714581,2011-11-13,1013444,Jason,Karen came through after a last minute cancellation and saved the day. Her apartment was perfect close to transport and comfortable. I'd highly recommend her home for any future trips to Paris.
1176558,40462549,2015-07-31,3543595,Kate,We stayed in Virginie's place for 4 nights with our 2 children. The location is absolutely ideal at the top of the Marais and very close to Republique metro station. There's a little supermarket butcher and bakery less that a minute away and heaps of fabulous cafes restaurants and shops. Virginie was a wonderful host who organised a baby cot for us recommended a nearby hotel for family and had some essentials (tea biscuits etc) when we arrived. She was always contactable and the apartments is beautifully homely with plenty of room. We hope to stay again soon.
35595457,546146081,2019-10-13,73726661,Kátia,O Oussama é uma pessoa de excelente comunicação entretanto um péssimo anfitrião pois fomos recebidos com o local completamente imundo tivemos que fazer a limpeza recolher todos os lixos comprar roupas de cama o local não parece que passa por limpeza é possível ver nos detalhes banheira e privada encardidas isso fora toda a sujeira que encontramos. Além disso ainda fomos surpreendidos com oficial de justiça batendo na porta e informando que o Oussama não tem permissão para alugar o local. O airbnb precisa tomar providências pois pagamos pela estadia taxa de limpeza a etc.
8065771,337953691,2018-10-18,208238811,Lingling,Great view and easy commute! Love the neighborhood people were very nice there. The apartment is fully equipped. Everything you need is there. Also it is very clean and quiet.
7430295,548296483,2019-10-17,34946493,Eugene,"Temple Square is where I’d like to live in Paris ...if I could and Renou’s apt is located right there. Stayed for 2 nights/3 days was always quiet inside lots of light and spacious. Good quality restaurants frequented by locals right next to you rue de Bretagne feet away and the whole Marais neighborhood. Subway 3 minutes away at place republique can get you everywhere quickly.
If you wanna mingle with trendy locals and feel the local vibe this is the place. Maybe not the most affordable or luxurious but you pay for location after all.
Also ...you have to know it’s 5 floors up the stairs. So not for everyone...
Would very likely book again."
31427613,489646173,2019-07-17,533822,Vincent,Appartement sans fenêtre ouvrable (cuisine condamnée vélux chambre trop haut). Rez-de-chaussée donnant sur une cour où il y a de très gros travaux ce qui rend l'accès à l'appartement difficile et bien entendu beaucoup de bruit. Propreté irréprochable. Gestion complètement impersonnelle de l'appartement par une agence. Je recommande à condition de bien savoir om vous mettez les pieds!
3722595,451104470,2019-05-11,21142680,Jordan,Pierre's place in Le Marais was clean comfortable and very cool.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Pierre is a fabulous host who speaks great English is quick to answer questions or concerns and was able to greet us at check-in.  The two bedroom/two bathroom is so so nice for two couples but there is also a pull-out if you have additional friends.  We were appreciative of the brand new washer/dryer.  Pierre also has a whole binder of suggestions on neighborhood/city favorites which was really helpful.  We will definitely stay here the next time we are in Paris.

1872443,197692052,2017-09-26,143204022,Glenn,First overseas AirBNB experience and it was fabulous.  Pascal is easy to communicate with and very clear on the various details of check in etc.  We asked for a recommendation for a car service from CDG to the apartment he arranged it for us with a service he uses so the driver knows the location and the process to get into the apartment.  However this wasn't really necessary as Pascal had sent detailed instructions in advance.  Pascal met us on our arrival and was able to allow us to check in early and explained how everything worked (coffee maker washer etc.)  The apartment was fabulous.  Clean great location huge bathroom/shower.  Was exactly as described no disappointments in any aspect.  Pascal wrote down his recommendation on local restaurants bakeries etc. when we asked him for some ideas.  He checked in via e-mail mid-way through the stay to make sure everything was ok.  All in all great place great location and great host.  Next time we go to Paris we will stay there again.

My family and I really enjoyed our stay. This is my second time in Paris and I've always wanted to stay close to the Eiffel Tower and I made the right choice! 

The apartment is also clean and complete with everything you need! 

Our host also gladly arranged for our airport transfers.

Will surely rent this apartment again when we come back! "

The apartment is clean and nice; the living room is so luminous and the bedrooms are quite even if the place is in a street full of pubs.

The hospitality is amazing as Emma and Kevin are so friendly and helpful with giving you advice on what to do in Paris and make you feel like their friends rather than just guests. The house is in the perfect location to travel anywhere in Paris a couple minute walk to the metro and right next to a lovely market open on Thursday’s and Sundays. In a very interesting and busy area however completely quiet at night. Again cannot recommend highly enough and hope to stay in the future again !! :)

Bastille is an exciting neighborhood with a lively nightlife scene but there was no problem with noise volume during the night.  Place des Vosges is a lovely square for a picnic!  For cocktails go to Moonshiner (speakeasy inside of Da Vito pizzeria).  For an easy French meal go to Chez Janou.  For an excellent craft beer store go to La Moustache Blanche.  For a vegan meal go to Dune.  For a fancy meal go to Septime.  And don't forget the Opera -- all of this within a 5-minute walk!"

Only one thing to notify is that this place is in the same building with one famous cafe which operates basically all day. We could hear people's walking around all day(However the noise didn't really bother us)
I will definately come back here when I visit Paris! Thank you Mehdi!(:

전부 다 괜찮았습니다! 
우선 위치가 에펠탑이랑 정말 가까워서 좋았습니다!(걸어서 3분거리에 에펠탑이 보여요!) 그리고 버스정거장도 엄청 가까워서 다른지역(오페라 몽마르트 등)에 가기도 매우 편해요! 특히 북역 올때 버스 한번에 와서 정말 좋습니다! 주변에 약국도 많고 샵도 많고 카페도 먾아서 좋아요! 
그리고 깨끗하고 집에 조리도구 등 웬만한건 다 있어서 정말 좋습니다! 아! 와이파이 진~~짜 잘돼요! 한국인에게 중요한 와이파이 완벽합니다! 그리고 호스트가 정말 친절하고 매일 불편한 점 물어봐서 해결해줘요! 
한가지 말씀드릴건 같은 건물에 유명한 cafe constant가 있는데 계단 오르락 내리락 거리는 소리가 계속 들려요! 근데 그렇게 불편한 정도는 아니고 예민하신 분이면 신경쓰일수 있습니다! 카페는 열한시까지 영업을 해서 그때까지는 계단 소리가 들려요!
다시 파리에 오게된다면 꼭 여기서 다시 묵고 싶네요! Thanks. Mehdi!"
13580556,141677693,2017-04-04,37093843,Riley,This studio is located in the fantastic  Le Marais neighborhood. The location is perfect if you plan to travel through Paris on foot or via public transit (~5 mins from several major metro lines). There are many memorable bars and cafes in all directions.  The studio while small  was clean and comfortable.

The apartments location is perfect it is a two minute walk to Vavin metro station which connects you to all of Paris. Amazing patisserie on the corner of the street to grab croissants for breakfast and a small grocery store just down the road. Plenty of restaurants near by and the area is very clean and safe! We had no problems with the wi fi - it was great to have this. 

Overall a fantastic experience and will book again next time I'm in Paris! "

Good location located a 15 minute walk from the heart of the Marais a wonderful district full of shops restaurants parks and much more.  The apartment itself was good (though not having air conditioning proved challenging when we stayed there even though they did provide 3 small fans).  The apartment is nicely appointed. Good linens and towels especially.  Dorssaf who greeted us provided lots of advice on what to do and where to go while in Paris!

Upon arriving to the address however we discovered that the building was under renovation. Scaffolding covered the exterior big dumpsters parked right in front.  Entrance was run down and the electricity was not working making it very dark.  
At the end sat an wooden staircase covered in dust. As we climbed up to the second floor (the elevator starts one floor above ground level) we were surrounded by stained walls pealing paint falling plaster and broken windows. Stacked by our front door were piles of construction materials.

The court yard was under construction. During the first couple of days there was construction starting at 8AM. Noise and smell of tar was our wake up call.
 
Kitchen.  There is NOTHING in terms of basics: no sugar salt pepper oil coffee garbage bags paper towels or toilet paper (they only provided 1.5 rolls for 3 people for 10 days). They offer a cleaning kit for purchase at 13 euros that includes 2 tablets for the laundry machine 2 for the dishwasher machine sponge and 1 garbage bag. 
 
Ludovic apologized for the work going on at the building (which was nice) and he promised to have the construction materials removed from our front door. It took 4 days.

If you do decide to stay here I suggest you review the listing carefully and make sure that the above challenges have been addressed.  

Fortunately we were in Paris and had an amazing time!

149959,311981294,2018-08-22,1180879,Carmen,"The apartment is simply amazing! It is very clean had everything we needed. Arletty is an awesome host! She is very friendly and assisted us in the checkin getting to know the apartment and the restaurants nearby. 

The apartment is on a higher floor which gives us a great view and privacy that we wanted. 

The kitchen amenities was very useful for our breakfast considering the bakeries around had really good croissants and pastries!  

We loved that we had a sofa corner for relaxing and a study area. 

Overall will definitely recommend Everyone to stay at Arletty’s lovely place!! 

The neighbourhood is great the food nearby is simply awesome. (Le Verne Vole for dinner (best to reserve in advance) and La Vache Dans Les Vignes) for cheese and wine!! 

My Husband and I loved the walks we had along the canal was great after dinner. The apartment and neighbourhood really made our stay in Paris even better than expected. "
2449295,20136612,2014-09-24,10935144,Ronggen,"We would like to give 5 stars to Christophe's apartment on the charge we paid: 1) location &location: 2 min to Metro then city center for less 10 min plus cafe restaurants and supermarkets all around corners.  2) the place is such quite and clean one we got we'll sleep and rest.  3) ""Information office"" works at all day: Christophe always tries to help us not only for Paris's infor. but also for buying city pass booking taxi and etc.
So there is no any reason not to recommend Christophe's apt. to friends and any person who plans to visit Paris."

Not only is the apartment beautiful stylish and equipped with all the important amenities--including air conditioning which is very important in the summer!!--but Nathan was attentive communicative and very welcoming. He insisting on helping to bring my suitcase up the many stairs even though it was very heavy said I was welcome to any of the items in the fridge and provided me with amazing restaurant suggestions when I asked him. The apartment is in a great location is very comfortable and has the most charming balcony. I highly recommend!

10426093,330956653,2018-10-01,1375132,Saroj,"Maxim’s place is in an excellent location and he added several helpful tips about the places in the neighbourhood. We walked around everyday with our 10 month old baby in the stroller and enjoyed Paris. For the first couple of nights we stayed out late because of jet lag and enjoyed drinks and dinner literally nearby. And when the baby would wake up we would simply pay and walk the block or so back to Maxime’s place. We could not have asked for a more accessible location.

It was very thoughtful for Maxime to have a manual in English to use various appliances and gadgets in his place. We need the kitchen to cook baby food. Overall it was great. 

A few things could have gone a bit better. Checkin and checkout instructions were not very well communicated. Luckily the old lady next door helped us with getting his keys from the cafe next door. Checkin confusion was understandable however we were disappointed to see the next guest arrive earlier than our agreed checkout time. 

The bedroom had an odor of smoke due to which we could not use it and ended up sleeping on the convertible sofa-bed. I wish it was mentioned in the details that it is a smoking place.

In general I wish we were able to get responses quicker and there were more details in the listing. Other than that I think it is a great place to enjoy your vacation in Paris."

Limpei o studio antes de entregá-lo mas não tirei férias para fazer faxina ao chegar seria fundamental que isto também fosse revisto; - Fiz o pagamento integral em abril da muita insegurança realizar um pagamento com uma política ""rígida"" com as regras que este impõe e te dificuldade em ter retorno das minhas consultas. Sou organizada e alem de tirar dúvidas precisava combinar que meu irmão pegasse as chaves; não tive retorno à diversas tentativas de contato e quando tive foi um e-mail cheio de exclamações e interrogações colocando em dúvida nossa tentativas de contato para o número de telefone indicado no Airbnb que pertence a seu marido; - O prédio esta em obras alem de pintura e o apartamento ao lado do studio se encontra também em obra havia barulho de batidas e de máquina a partir das 8:30 da manhã (salvo no período entre as festas); com a antecedência que fiz e paguei a reserva e o cuidado para realizar a viagem poderia ter sido avisada com antecedência nas inúmeras tentativas de contato seria mais ético do que ser avisada da obra no local estar com as roupas e pertences sujos de tinta poeira e massa corrida ou não e ser acordada com barulho durante suas férias em Paris é uma escolha que todo hóspede principalmente o que paga todo o montante de 31 diárias com antecedência tem o direito a fazer. - O número de contato fornecido segundo informado é do marido da proprietária (que segundo soube é muito simpático e assegurou meu irmão que usasse seu número para qualquer contato) simpático mas dificilmente responde.

12602216,202670915,2017-10-12,91000583,Marina,"Location is definitely the best thing about this studio very close to Metro/RER Station in a lively neighborhood with a creperie and boulangerie just downstairs and supermarkets maybe 10 minutes away on foot. To reach apartment you have to go up 3 floors in a spiral staircase no elevators which can be difficult if you have larger or heavier luggage to carry up. 
As a family of 4 (small) adults each with 1 small suitcase we did feel a little cramped in the studio. Be aware that when the sofa-bed is fully extended the passageway from the bunk-bed to rest of apartment (toilet kitchen bathroom) is blocked because the tv rack is right in front of sofa-bed. This worked out ok for our family but if the guests sleeping in the bunk-bed needed the toilet in the middle of the night you'd have to climb over the lower bed (and guests) to cross to the toilet. 
Bathroom and toilet are separate rooms with the sleeping area and the kitchen in between. Bathroom looks newly renovated with an amazing shower great space and very clean. We just werent able to fully enjoy how spacious the bathroom is due to window curtain being quite see-through so we would have to change clothes inside shower area. 
My suggestions to improve the next guest's experiences would be for host to provide detergent for washing dishes paper towels and more toilet paper rolls (we had 2 for a 5 day stay and 4 people). Also carpet probably needs changing it looks quite stained. 
The place is managed by a company and communication and coordination of check-in was handled by Sacha through email. Any question or complain was quickly and kindly responded by Sacha. I hope they take our suggestions into consideration because it really is a great location."

It’s a quick walk to the metro so it makes it very easy to get to other parts of Paris. Her flat was welcoming and very clean. 

Pauline was out of town while we stayed at her flat so her friend helped us check in and out - her friend was very helpful and kind. But even though Pauline was away she still took the time to check-in and make sure that everything was going well and if we needed anything. Pauline gave us great recommendations on where to eat and have a few drinks - something that we definitely took advantage of! 

I definitely recommend Pauline’s charming flat to anyone visiting Paris! It has a unique and welcoming charm that you just can’t beat!"

8101400,106429817,2016-10-06,94855086,Ashley,If you can make it up those 7 flights of stairs you'll find yourself in cute little attic space perfect for a short stay for one max two people. The pictures are pretty accurate... literally a bed and a bathroom. Not recommended for tall or big people since the ceilings are all extremely slanted. Julien left straightforward instructions and I enjoyed the neighborhood... super close to the metro!

There is no lift which was detailed in the listing but the stairs were quite steep and slippery - a little nerve racking after wine! The flat was clean and contained everything we needed.

38859650,542149652,2019-10-06,37542283,Valerie,"The worst experience EVER with Airbnb. 
Me and my friend arrived for a short business trip in Paris and stayed 2
Nights at Alice place. The location is convenient between Chatelet and metro station Etienne Marcel. The check in was made by a friend of Alice who seemed nice but we were given to less and incorrect information.She explained us that because of too less time ( Check in is attended from 14h - we arrived at 15h) they couldn’t wash the towels on time so she explained that they are still for an hour at the wash machine+dryer but after we can take our clean and dry towels. She said there are no Tv Chanels on the Tv but Netflix and Youtube. Non of it was true. When we opened the dryer after finishing the program the towels were crazy wet so during the whole trip they didn’t get dry. The dryer is on french so we couldn’t even find how to deal with it. There was no Tv basically because nothing was working. On top of all the bed sheets were not changed from the previous guests they were smelling bad we found hairs and the pillow cases were basically black dirty!!! We had only ONE LAMP at the room so we barely could see at the nights. No heating. I called Alice straight and but didn’t answer...called her at least 50 times that day with any luck. I wrote messages- no answer. On the next day i had been answered only about the Netflix which was the smallest and unimportant problem. Really disappointed.... for such flats we have to get the money back..... 
never book it you will destroy your trip in beautiful Paris..."

If you want a authentic Parisian experience with cafes shopping and restaurants that are outside of the typical tourist experience then this apartment is perfectly located. A short walk to the metro and the captivating Rue de mouffetard made us the envy of any tourist or local Parisian alike. Our host Max could not have been more accommodating or responsive and our only compliant was that his lovely dog Mia couldn’t stay with us.

878992,406104825,2019-01-28,56833551,Петрова,Very unpleasant impressions about the apartment and its owners! Of the advantages of housing - only its location. We arrived in Paris late in the evening where we were met by relatives living in Paris. Since we do not speak French the guys helped us settle down and bring things in. Night and twilight in the room hid all the charms of this apartment. The noisy morning gatherings of our hosts living above us the small room and very good acoustics the dirty rug near the shower stall and the presence of only bath towels did not at all make us happy the next day. We decided to change the apartment which was reported to the owners without complaint. Frank rudely accused us of having seven people living in this small kennel and taking pictures of 7 wine glasses that I washed! The room is very small dark and dirty! If someone dares to rent this apartment he will see that it’s not comfortable for two and as many as seven as the “hospitable host” claims cannot be at all! Frank verbally promised to return half of the money we paid. After the day passed according to the rules of AIRBNB during which you can officially file a claim for the return of money through the site Frank completely changed the rhetoric and on made up absolutely false accusations to us he refused the promised refund of money. In the end it turned out from the side of Frank an ordinary deception. Let my review be a warning to anyone who may be in a similar situation with the above owner.

식기나 냄비 후라이팬이 넉넉하게 있어서 요리해먹기 좋았고 아파트 바로옆에 큰 마트가있어서 장보기도 좋았습니다.

La posizione è fantastica: vicina a molti servizi e anche comoda per muoversi a piedi data la sua centralità.  Metropolitana  comunque vicina per chi vuole muoversi con i mezzi. Host gentile e disponibile.

- La douche été bouchée et sa conception la rend très facile à déborder. La salle de bain a été inondée et l'absence de séparation avec le séjour fait que celui-ci aussi l'a été. Nous avons du éponger avec nos serviettes et les utiliser pour essayer d'empêcher l'eau de sortir de la salle de bain. Le lavabo était aussi légèrement bouché mais cela n'a pas posé de problème.
- Un seul rouleau de papier toilette presque fini. Heureusement un Franprix en bas de la rue a pu nous dépanner.
- L'évier de la cuisine n'avait que de l'eau chaude quelle que soit la position du robinet.
- L'hôte a oublié de nous envoyer le code de l'interphone.
- La propreté de la salle de bain n'était pas parfaite.

Dommage sans ces quelques problèmes ce séjour aurait été excellent."

402516,21910579,2014-10-26,22388000,Van,We love Marco's apartment and the it's owner. The apartment is very spacious and very light. The location is great just 5 m from the metro station and next to the bubbly walking street. Next door is a Starbucks and 3 supermarkets. Marco is an excellent host we could not ask anything more he provided everything to make sure our stay was a  completely stress free. We didn't have to buy anything for our daily needs except of course - food. Marco provided everything: soaps cleaning liquids laundry detergent... He provided a fridge full of milk water and Fruit juices for us. We would recommend everyone to stay at Marco's apartment. He is online almost all the time and reply to us very quickly.  
29720872,529742798,2019-09-15,40829727,Brittany,Vivian is great. She communicated with us very well she offered us local recommendations that were great and she was very responsive. The apartment was a little less than we expected but she tried to make it as up to date as possible. I will say the shower is a lot smaller than expected. My husband is 6 ft and had a hard time with it. Perfect for smaller.  Also we did not realize until later in the stay that the hall lights came on. There are buttons to press in the hallway. It might be a common thing but we did not experience that. We thought there were no lights. The apartment is defiantly smaller than we thought so I would only recommend 2 people.

22979,886953,2012-01-28,685037,Jim,You can't ask for a more perfect place to stay in Paris.  So close to Notre Dame you can hear the bells when they go off on the hour during the day.   Lisa is such a wonderful host.  Really warm and helpful.  Her vast knowledge of  the city is a great resource when you are trying to figure out what to do while visiting the City of Light.  The room is very comfortable and the internet connection is fast.  Everything you need is just steps away... food drink shopping transit museums. I ended up walking most of the time since Ile de la Cite is the geographic center of Paris.  I definitely recommend staying with Lisa.  
4407168,72513268,2016-05-03,21479133,Konstantinos,"Η διαμονή μας στο διαμέρισμα της Amélie ήταν πολύ καλή. Η Amélie είναι πολλή ευγενική και εξυπηρετική. Όταν την ενημερώσαμε ότι η τηλεόραση δεν λειτουργεί ήρθε η ίδια και προσπάθησε να την φτιάξει. Βέβαια δεν ήταν τόσο σημαντικό που δεν είχαμε τηλεόραση διότι ήμασταν την περισσότερη ώρα έξω στην πόλη.
Το διαμέρισμα είναι σε κεντρικό σημείο της πόλης και όλα είναι πολύ κοντά αν θέλει να πάει κανείς περπατώντας.
Η στάση του μετρό είναι 3 λεπτά με τα πόδια.
Η θερμοκρασία στο διαμέρισμα ήταν ιδανική και υπήρχε συνεχώς ζεστό νερό. Επίσης ήταν πολύ καθαρό το διαμέρισμα.
Αν πρέπει να πω κάτι αρνητικό ίσως είναι για την κουρτίνα του ντους. Είναι πολύ μακριά και κρατάει νερά. Χρειάζεται κάποια άλλη λύση.
Για άτομα μεγαλύτερης ηλικίας ίσως δεν είναι το ιδανικό διαμέρισμα διότι έχει πολλά σκαλιά μέχρι τον τρίτο όροφο αλλά και το κρεβάτι στο πατάρι θα δυσκολέψει λίγο. Εμείς όμως θα μέναμε ευχαρίστως ξανά στο ίδιο διαμέρισμα και το συνιστούμε ανεπιφύλακτα.

We were able to walk everywhere except the Eiffle Tower which was a short trip on the Metro. The restaurants nearby were excellent as was the shopping. The apartment was modern and clean bed very comfortable. The hosts Laurent and Audrey were very helpful and accommodating and contactable by phone and text. We will be back to stay again!

11165535,110935123,2016-10-29,20722166,Susan,The apartment was lovely and in a great location! The neighborhood was perfect for a bit of local living and also a great distance from many awesome sights. Notre Dame and Hotel De Ville were both a short walk away (if you don't mind a stroll through beautiful Paris) and there were Metro stations close by to get you to all the other major landmarks. There are plenty of good food places around. The apartment was lovely and clean and had everything we needed but was just a bit of a squeeze for two people with suitcases. Jean-Michel was a great host and met us upon arrival to help with check in. We had a great stay in Paris!

21419,446317076,2019-05-01,247656185,Barbara,Laurent's apartment is in an ideal location in the 2nd arrondissement adjacent to the wonderful pedestrian street Rue Montorgueil—with its restaurants and wine bars food and wine and ice cream shops bakeries and vibrant street life crowded with young people. Check-out wine bar Redd on the nearby Rue St. Saveur; and boulangerie Stohrer the oldest bakery in Paris and still excellent after 250 years (yummy croissants!). The apartment has a comfy large bed super-good wifi and cable that includes Netflix with your sign-in. There's also a nice Illy coffee machine and washing machine (but not a dryer) and lots of toiletries. We were so pleased and would stay there again!

It is also well-equipped and exactly what you see in the pictures...the bed and bathroom were very comfortable! The only inconvenience was the heat as the studio got really hot during a ""canicule"" (heat wave). I am 5-months pregnant so for me it was very uncomfortable to sleep without AC. Other than that it was a great experience and I recommend the place."

Outre l'accueil chaleureux de Xavier je me suis toute de suite sentie comme chez moi dans cet appartement coquet et propre.
De plus le quartier des Batignolles est plein de charme et très bien desservi.
Vous pouvez entre autres ""bruncher"" le dimanche dans le quartier après avoir fait votre marché ou prendre un petit café à la terrasse d'un café parisien...
Sans parler du fait que vous n'êtes qu'à quelques stations de métro des lieux à voir sur Paris.
Que votre voyage soit pour des motifs personnels ou professionnels n'hésitez pas à louer l'appartement de Xavier propriétaire discret mais toujours présent en cas de besoin."

The building is nice and clean only thing is ITS A WALK UP. Which isn't bad but imagine hiking up your luggage. The area is nice loved all the shops and bakeries for fresh bread and pasteries. Rob was very nice and answered all of my questions in a great time frame. Overall I loved his place and I would definitely use again.

Il est situé dans un quartier animé mais qui reste calme avec des rames de metro à 2min un supermarché juste en bas de l'appartement. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Elisabeth mais elle était très disponible par message pour toutes questions et s'est arrangée pour notre entrée et notre sortie de l'appartement. La salle de bain est petite mais suffisante pour deux personnes tout comme le reste de l'appartement avec une jolie décoration. Parfait pour quelques jours dans la capitale :)

We were very satisfied with this apartment and the environment - it was very near Metro and many nice shops in the area (+ a very nice and beautiful park just 5 minuts walk).
The apartment itself was big enough for us and contained many personal effects from the owner - which made us feel just as being guests in a private home.
Helene (the host) is very nice and warm and the last day we spend some hours together.
We can really recommend this apartment if you look for something very French and in a nice area."

Par contre la chambre et son confort sont très sommaires (il s’agit pas d’un appartement mais d’un studio 10m2 et il n’y a rien de douillet non plus dans l’apoartement). Ok pour dormir mais rien de plus. 
Le point négatif était la communication: le service est géré par Hostnfly nous avons donc été bombardé de mail avant notre arrivée qui nous demandait soit de répondre à des questions déjà répondues auparavant (but de la visite vérification) ou des innombrables offres publicitaires formulaires à remplir services taxi etc... enfin pour aller chercher la clé c’est une chasse au trésor avec un code d’accès et une adresse où aller chercher la clé. Tout à parfaitement fonctionné mais c’est une prise de tête inutile à mon avis.
La propreté du studio était ok juste le matelas était très sale."

17337321,179384830,2017-08-07,40810637,Max,"When it comes to location this apartment is perfect. It's walking distance from the heart of Paris and all of the most famous attractions/museums while also being fairly close to Monmartre. It's near two grocery stores it's next to a nice park and it's in a fairly young and hip area. I think that this factor alone is its most promising feature.

There were some issues however. The tiny kitchen space was really not ideal for cooking food in bulk (which I did since I was living on a strict food budget). I learned that I wasn't allowed to shower after midnight (which I really wanted to do since it was very hot and stuffy) and I couldn't use my restroom after midnight either. I also couldn't use toilet paper in my own toilet and was requested to dispose of it in a separate bin. This wasn't too bad honestly but it would have been nice to know this beforehand. 

There was a weird incident as well (which is an outlier): as I was falling asleep one night I heard creaking and a pop. The dresser above my bed started to fall over and I had to get up and stabilize it before it hit me. Things ended up being fine but it was weird and pretty scary. Besides this things were not falling apart in the apartment.

In general I would recommend this apartment for travelers on a budget who intend to stay for short periods of time and who don't plan on cooking too much food!"
15738681,122854238,2016-12-26,3514970,Alijah,"Thank you for opening your property to my group and myself. I will start off with the good. The kitchenette area was well decorated with the color patterns which gives the impression of an modern look property. The room size was accommodating to my group being that it was a party of 6. Okay this is where our experience goes downhill. The ad was very misleading to many things. The property type is categorized as a Loft and it also states ""The apartment is on the first floor and in the basement."" The rooms were old and dark looking. There was barely a window or natural sun light. The entire accommodation was located all in the basement excluding the half bathroom. Also states Cable TV which did not work either. There was no heat throughout the basement none of the heaters on the wall worked. After messaging the host there was no heat we were informed the heaters should be working fine and after trying to turn it on and allowing it to warm up there was still NO HEAT. Then she goes on to explain maybe the guest prior must of messed with something in regards to the heat. Host kept insisting the heater were working and unfortunately they were not at all. The only thing to work was the towel rack in the bathroom. After searching the rooms we stumbled upon portable heaters located in the closets which there was only 2 which left us rotating the heaters through the basement to stay warm remind you there is 3 bedrooms and the common area. Very disappointing. The refrigerator was not cold and items we purchased were not staying cold. Then there were no hot water to shower with most of our stay and what made matters WORSTTTTTT the stand up shower drainage was clogged and no water was going down which caused the bathroom to flood. ABSOLUTELY disgusting and nasty. Everyone was not able to shower humanly not wanting to risk having any sort of foot guys not knowing where or what that backed up water was coming from. The location of this property was convenient to our sight seeing destinations despite the filthy neighborhood. Finding parking was very iffy but we were successful after a few go arounds. There were no instructions as to where we place the garbage when taking it out toaster oven was placed very high up and was not plugged in we had to climb up on a chair to pull the toaster oven down to plug it in in order to utilize it we were never shown the rear door entrance nor the ""cute courtyard"" - I would recommend this place if you need somewhere to stay last minute for ONLY one night (in and out). Unfortunately I do not  recommend this property if you are looking for accommodation for several days/nights especially for large groups."
5824048,233939519,2018-02-11,96398445,Sabina,"our stay was super cool especially because of the location of the studio. All exactly like in the pictures and the communication with Benjamin was super easy. The only flaw was that the studio wasnt properly cleaned up dust hair and dirt was everywhere; especially a problem because we were both alergics.
I recomend this studio for a short stay in Paris because you can reach everything important by foot."

13989065,253839893,2018-04-15,25450333,Annalisa,This cozy apartment located in the heart of Paris is perfect for getting around in the city. A plus: It’s very easy to communicate with Xavier that will be very helpful during your staying in Paris.

19434928,287310723,2018-07-08,188320560,Samantha,AMAZING space- so big and nice to live in for a long period of time if you can! Great for a big family trip or even for friends getting together! Very close to a metro station that get you to most tourist spots only two to three stops away. There is a patisserie and grocery store right around the corner for morning coffee and breakfast or to get things to cook dinner with. I would absolutely recommend and go back!
7756345,204439900,2017-10-18,92069186,Carolyn,William’s place is an absolute gem of a find in Paris. The photos don’t do justice to just how awesome the view of the tower actually is in person and the whole place is beautifully decorated very comfortable and walking distance to so much! William was also an absolutely pleasure to work with up to and during our trip. We hope to stay here again!
8880925,513155695,2019-08-19,110751117,Kayla,This was our first trip to Paris and we had a wonderful stay at JM’s place. He and G were great hosts and very knowledgeable about the area. They provided us with fantastic recommendations for things to see places to eat and the best ways to get around Paris. Would highly recommend staying here especially if it is your first time in the city!

While getting up the stairs (even the half flight) with a suitcase from the lift was the only difficult part it was more than worth it with the beautiful open space! Great place to relax and walk from restaurants back home. Felt safe and like I was a Parisian for the night
24770423,402071048,2019-01-17,101584495,Elliot,This is an absolutely amazing apartment! I would highly recommend staying at this apartment great location amazing layout and everything you could ever want! Even strong water pressure!
23694522,535311093,2019-09-24,217587120,Karla,Good place quit more little than expected. You will have the metro right in from perfect for getting around. The house keeper is very nice and the host is quick to respond. Would recommend.
202782,2279626,2012-09-14,2955681,Avital,We arrived very late from the airport but Thomas greeted us gave us an idea for where to grab a bite for dinner and left us. The apartment was just as we hoped it would be very lovely and clean. We were just steps away from the metro and lots of cute restaurants. The only draw back was a brasserie down the way that was open late into the night we could hear noise from there when we left our windows open. Otherwise it's the perfect place to stay if Montmarte is where you want to stay.

21793200,454954053,2019-05-19,29285391,Janet,Zora's place is close to the Metro and there are no flights of stairs to climb.  Both a bonus.  The kitchen area is neat and tidy and the small unit has a new bathroom.  As it is the unit would be great for a short stay.  We stayed for five nights and I would have liked better lighting in the bedroom and a couple of comfortable chairs.

31165213,537315352,2019-09-28,23201860,Roman,Appartments are really amazing and placed in absolutely terrifying area: new Paris transport is all is near you can get to city center only for half and hour. Appartments has everything you need and rather more. Balcony is outstanding.
2070374,524157180,2019-09-05,19477128,Lele,Francis place is a very comfortable apartment great lighting and ventilation. The windows give it a classic Parisian vibe that is very welcoming. It is an old safe building located in a busy street with cafes and bars so it is safe to walk at night. It is 3 min away from the nearest metro station and 30 min from the common tourist places. Linen and towels were clean rooms and bathrooms were clean. The living room has AC and the main bedroom too. The rest of the rooms do not have AC. Kitchen is well equipped. Thank you for your warm hospitality!! Definitely recommended!!
2484267,14079108,2014-06-11,13124080,Anna,"Situato molto bene nel cuore della città. L'appartamento è piccolo ma assolutamente confortevole per una coppia o tre/quattro buoni amici. Tipicamente parigino. Ci è piaciuto molto. Gli ospiti (Sophie e famiglia) sono molto disponibili gentili e accoglienti. Da consigliare! Bisogna soltanto abituarsi a salire cinque piani di scale senza ascensore (ma anche questo fa parte dello charme di Parigi)!

Très bien situé au coeur de la ville. L'appart est petit mais tout à fait confortable pour un couple ou trois/quatre bons copains. Typiquement parisien. On l'a beaucoup aimé.

Denis don't miss any detail to explain the Arrival departure  procedure and activities suggestions. It is a very good option considering what you pay.
8448023,122864337,2016-12-26,94688923,Linda,Most importantly for us - it was very clean! It's a beautiful apartment however we had a problem controlling the temperature. We visited over Christmas (very chilly outside) and had to leave the windows open because the apartment was so hot. The apartment temperature is controlled by a building manager. Francois tried to help by calling the manager but we still had to leave the windows open for our entire stay. 
29827232,434616338,2019-04-08,246286894,Elizabeth,Very electric and quirky decor although not entirely family friendly ( a number of artistic nude prints).  As said in other reviews not really set up for small children since only bathroom is down twisty stairs with major fall potential.  Very close to metro and shops. Felt very authentically Parisian

16300187,152718369,2017-05-18,41433166,Supratip,Couldn't have asked for (Website hidden by Airbnb) was neat and clean  walkable to anyplace restaurants  metro  Eiffel tower is 1 km walk . Even the host waited for us for more than 1 hour since we were late checking in and special thanks to the person who helped us taking our luggage to the top . Stairs are the only thing but that's ok since we had to come down once and get up once a day  all the more it gives you a good practice since probably for all the monuments in Paris you have to take a good number of stairs .Loved it enjoyed it and will be in our memory for long time .

Although the building and the neighborhood were not the best the apartment was and when we arrived everything was very clean"
518742,40928202,2015-08-03,3792905,William,Michelle was a helpful and thoughtful host and the stay was excellent.  We loved the studio which was the perfect size for us.  (Yes it's a bit small but we weren't in Paris to stay inside!)  The location is tough to beat as some of the best wining and dining options were within a short walking distance.  I would recommend to anyone staying in Paris with the only caveat that it will be a very tight fit for more than two.

12179994,152719887,2017-05-18,10504871,Claire,My fiancé and I stayed at Annette's place for a few nights this spring and we very much enjoyed our time there. Annette was unable to be there when we arrived but left us with detailed instructions on how to get into the apartment. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival - a welcome sight after traveling all day! The apartment itself is small but extremely clean welcoming and very charming. We were even able to make use of their washer and dryer which was helpful after traveling for over a week. It is close to several metro stops and restaurants making the location very convenient. I had several questions for Annette over the course of our stay and she was always quick to respond. I would definitely stay there again!

The studio is great clean and close to metro and grocery stores. Looks exactly the same as in the pictures.
I highly recommend Dominique's studio for sure."
16090013,138906309,2017-03-22,15941598,Janet,Location. Location. Location. This was perfect. We walked every where. Place was spotless. Smaller than I expected. Only one easy chair. Would have been nice to have a little sitting area. Owner was very responsive when I asked for more towels. Also gave us two bottles of wine. (Merci.) There is a very small elevator but you have to walk up one level to get to it and one-half level to get from the elevator to the apartment. No problem for us. We never used the elevator preferring to get the exercise. But might be a difficulty for others.
28297245,525814282,2019-09-08,254133097,Emily,My friends and I really enjoyed our stay at your place. Everything was up to or exceeded expectations and it was exactly what we wanted.

He was extremely flexible and communicated thoroughly with us. It was great!

L'appartement était propre à notre arrivée. Très bien situé dans le quartier du 6e arrondissement et au 3e étage d'un vieil immeuble parisien l'appartement répondait à nos attentes. L'immeuble est sécurisé avec un badge pour entrer à l'intérieur. Le quartier est calme pour Paris (il y a une école juste derrière l'immeuble donc il est possible d'entendre des enfants aux heures de récréation) et nous avons eu l'impression de vivre dans un ""petit village"" car tout est à proximité (boulangerie carrefour city restaurants bars...). C'était idéal pour ma formation car le logement était à 3 minutes à pieds et de nombreux lieux à visiter sont à proximité (musées jardins du Luxembourg...) ou un peu plus loin car nous étions très proche du métro (station St Germain des prés). Le tarif pour ce logement est très attrayant pour le quartier. 
En plus notre hôte a été super sympa ! Il répondait très rapidement aux différents mails envoyés est venu nous chercher à la station de métro nous a fait visiter le quartier et en cas de problème on pouvait le contacter très rapidement par sms. 
Si je dois retourner en formation ou passer un week end parisien je retourne sans hésiter chez Mathieu ! ! "

9510873,86524517,2016-07-16,3339377,Elizabeth,Nathalie's place was perfect for what we were looking for. You could not beat the view. The place is VERY small so if you are not comfortable in small spaces it may not work for you. It worked for us because we were only in the room to sleep. The 6 flights of stairs was difficult to get suitcases up but we got used to going up and down. The place was clean and even the bathroom that we shared with other apartments was clean. We never saw any of the other tenants. The place is centrally located in one of THE best neighborhoods in Paris and right next to the Sevres Babylon metro station. Location location location! We had some miscommunication checking in (Nathalie had a friend check us in and she had a different idea of where she was supposed to meet). It was not anyone's fault but make sure to organize that all beforehand. Also if you go in the summer months you may want to consider buying a small fan - it goes pretty hot a couple of nights. A fan would have made it very comfortable. Otherwise it was an amazing little place with an unbeatable Eiffel Tower view and a true Parisian experience. We would rent again.

During my trip i got really sick and she would constantly check in on me and make me tea and try to nurse me back to health no exaggeration but she took care of me more than my own mom has ever done. Also the cat is super cute and I love her too! Overall great experience and would 10/10 recommend for your next stay in Paris.

Appartement is in een leuke wijk gelegen in de 19e arrondissement op twee minuten loopafstand van de metro.
Door de locatie moet je wel even wat langer in de metro zitten als je direct naar de Eiffeltoren wil maar als je gewoon in het centrum uitstapt is elke toeristische spot op loopafstand van elkaar.
In de wijk zelf zijn een heleboel cafés en supermarkten en op tien minuten loopafstand is een heel mooi park."

Еще так как хозяйка не встречает лично очень сложно разобраться как включить телевизор свет и тд. Помучались с неверными данными от wifi которые прислала хозяйка но потом нашли на сайте то что нужно (немного странная ситуация если честно) А так Квартира очень милая дом старый с классным подъездом. Рядом куча вариантов транспорта расположение очень удобное. За небольшие деньги очень даже хороший вариант! Советую)

The house was  excellent it literally has everything we need and the location is so good it’s near by the supermarket bistro cafe bus stop metro.......all can be reach in 5 minutes.

Because of the DIY check-in and there is no elevator we have to carry our luggage to the 5 floor but it’s alright.

We really had a lovely time in this house and Paris!!"

349296,428501638,2019-03-25,23285402,Regina,Charlie's apartment is a really special place.  The furnishings are simple but it is clean and the views from the balcony are spectacular.  A true paris gem. The neighborhood is vibrant and walkable with excellent restaurants and shops.  The parking Charlie recommended was safe but very expensive as expected for paris.

8437133,63380691,2016-02-22,56404506,Laura,Valerie was extremely professional and flexible from the beginning and instructions were clear. The apartment is in a good convenient and safe location in Paris. It is in good condition; very clean and basic - but enough for 1 person and a short stay. The pictures are accurate. I highly recommend Valerie's apartment if you're a solo traveller staying for a short period in Paris and I will stay again.

21051885,260047460,2018-05-03,46913853,Ad,Wij (vader met twee pubers) hebben paar heerlijke dagen gehad bij Jean. Hij is erg vriendelijk en gaf ons tips over restaurants en dingen om te doen. Het appartement is midden tussen een aantal metrostations op vijf minuten lopen erg handig als uitvalsbasis voor bezoekjes aan de bezienswaardigheden. Je kan daar in de buurt op meerdere plekken prima eten.
830606,448583021,2019-05-05,252005397,Xavier,Très bel appartement au style vintage très fonctionnel. La propriétaire a pris soin de mettre à disposition un document explicatif sur le fonctionnement interne de l'appartement. La proximité du métro facilite les déplacements. Proximité des commerces. De belles balades à faire dans le quartier (voir guide du routard).
24436670,315581339,2018-08-29,65581399,Giovanna,Siamo stati a Parigi nel mese di agosto e ci siamo trovati benissimo nell'alloggio di Lea. Esso ha una posizione molto favorevole per visitare la città a pochi passi dalla fermata della metro. Il quartiere è simpatico e molto frequentato forse un pochino rumoroso ma nei limiti.  La casa è come viene descritta luminosa ed accogliente pulita e con tutti i servizi necessari per un comodo soggiorno.  Consigliamo sicuramente a tutti.
1765551,310956606,2018-08-20,191727960,Jennifer,Had a great stay in Paris at Simon's place. It is in the perfect location for all the sightseeing you want to do. Probably about an 8 minute walk to two different metro stops. It was warm when we were there so even with a fan in the room it was warm but we still slept okay. Simon was always quick to communicate. Place was clean. Recommend.

571447,3657751,2013-03-01,4056999,Rafael,Excellent room good lighting good view of Paris and plenty of space. The apartment is big with a great kitchen.

2638567,328471129,2018-09-26,25093368,Jungun,"위치 퍼펙트합니더. 아주 좋아브러요. 다만 안뜰이 공사중이라 숙소 창문의 위치가 안뜰이라 일주일 내내 창문을 열지 못해 숩기가 장난 아니었어요. 세면대도 사진이랑 달리 오래되서 곰팡이나 얼룩도 있었지만 세수할 때 특별히 방해되지는 않았어요. 저희는 가을에 와서 선풍기가 필요없었지믄 여름이라면 선풍기를 쓸텐데 좀 더러워서 체크인 전에 호스트한테 깨끗하게 해달라고 요청해보시는게 좋을 거 같아요. 
저는 이런 사항을 아니까 다음에 갈 때  감수 하겠지만 처음 묵는 분들은 당황타실 수 있어요. 호스트의 응답은 대체로 빨라서 제 요청 사항을 가급적 빨리 해결해줬어요. 가령 휴지나 수건(1시람 당 1장을 주니까 이건 좀 유의)을 더 준다거나 체크인 했을 때 집이 정돈이 되있지않아서 새로 청소해줬어요."

839738,33630328,2015-05-30,16673414,Yvo,Place was as described/pictured - small but clean and great price. Perfect for just a one night stay. Host was very responsive to emails and gave me many options for getting there. There was no WiFi of which to speak though the listing says there is. Host was accommodating when I wondered if it was possible to stay an extra hour since my flight times otherwise meant I'd have to drag my bag around with me for that hour. 
9672712,90945762,2016-08-03,72637751,Julian,we had a very nice stay at Erics apartment. The whole Apartment was very clean and modern specialy the bathroom is awesome. The Apartment is surrounded by a very nice are and is closed to the Subway.

12140643,164159635,2017-06-26,49657697,Ruben,Vincent was very amiable and quick to help us with anything we needed. My only issue was the heatwave we endured through our trip which Vincent had nothing to do with of course. I would recommend his place and advise anyone going to utilize it as it is far enough away to feel like you are in a cozy neighborhood but close enough to enjoy the tourist treks and nightlife.
7148205,270815625,2018-05-30,44774313,Sally,Guillaume was a great host met us at the studio explained how everything worked.

89058,408955216,2019-02-06,73966717,Yael,"Caroline's place was truely great! 
A lovely apartment - very cosy has an artistic touch with beautiful paintings and other small things to make you feel at home!
I stayed at Caroline's place for three weeks and It answered all of my needs: the place is very spacious a living room with a small kitchen I used regularly  a cosy bedroom and the lovely reading space (as seen in the photos).
less than 2-minute walk from the Metro ""Blanche"" (line 2) first floor (no lift). The appartment is in a very vibrant and young area! Many shops and bars down on the street and close (even by foot) to many other central areas in Paris. Felt safe to walk around all day long (despite the bad reputation of the Moulin Rouge area). Another benifit - the noises from the street are not heard inside the place. (: 
Caroline was so considerate when I had to make last-minute changes of the dates and I was very greatful for her understanding. I didn't get a chance to meet Caroline in person but across the hall lives Caroline's sister which was SO nice and generous making me feel at home and answering all my questions. 
I strongly recommend the place for anyone - long or short term - who is looking for a simple yet lovely and very cosy Parisien stay!"

More importantly its location is perfect cos it is close to famous attractions such as Louvre Eiffel Tower Avenue des Champs-Elysees. Therefore you can enjoy these spots by foot like local people instead of tourists in a rush. Additionally the host Guillaume is kind careful and friendly so you can feel warm since booking his house a nearly perfect studio.

All had great time. The location is amazing. Close to subway hop on and hop off bus stop. We walked to Louver along the Seine river bank in a rainy morning. It is so beautiful.

5328472,36174753,2015-06-26,13888439,Justine,Jeanne is the perfect host--completely concerned about her guests and kind and attentive about making their stay a wonderful experience. I was traveling with my young daughter and we felt absolutely at home and very safe in Jeanne's apartment. It was the week of Fete Musicale and outside was a scene but her place was a lovely quiet refuge with a pretty garden outside the window. We felt like true Parisians. Jeanne also managed to find us a car service to the airport on the morning all Paris taxis went on strike. I would be delighted to stay again. Thank you Jeanne!

If you book this bateau and we hope you will:
- review with Marie what to do upon arrival to the gate;
- review how to get the shower to provide hot water (did not figure this out until the morning of our departure);
- if you will need TV get Marie to show you how her system works...

We loved our first time in Paris and this bateau was perfect for our needs.
ENJOY!!!"

Françoise is the perfect host she is wonderful. She's extremely kind patient laid-back and very sweet. The apartment is gorgeous. It's extremely clean (trust me most places in Paris are not to these standards) and it's easily accessible via the lift. I would and will be staying here again no doubt. "

979596,159524780,2017-06-11,23819045,Elizabeth,"DREAM APARTMENT IN PARIS: This extraordinary apartment has a perfect location in the center of Paris: on the left bank directly on the Seine in between the Louvre and Notre Dame. Despite the loud traffic on the quai the apartment is blissfully quiet because it is set back behind another building overlooking a private garden! The only noise is birdsong. The building has a small elevator (there are three steps up to get to it and then two steps down once you get to the third floor). The apartment is perfect for one or two people. It has a very comfortable bed and sitting area. The kitchen is small but fully functional. The bathroom has been modernized. Everything is super clean and well decorated. Pierre was a perfect host. When we arrived our plane was delayed by a couple of hours and he was very relaxed about waiting for us. He has guide books and a local map showing grocery stores etc. helping one get accustomed to the neighborhood immediately. 
I would only note that the bathtub-shower has a high rim and so one needs to be a little flexible to get in and out of it. Also the weather was cool during our visit but if it had been hot I would have asked for a fan. There is no air conditioning that I could see.
We had an amazing stay there and hope to return!"
661277,8128173,2013-10-16,7437326,Lucie,Merveilleuse nuit dans un des quartiers les plus agréables de la capitale. Un petit coin de bonheur au cœur du Marais avec tout ce dont j'aurais pu rêver.  Notre hôte a été à l'écoute et attentif à nos besoins malgré les aléas professionnels qui nous ont contraint à une arrivée tardive. Tout était parfait.  
1055372,11482112,2014-04-05,10461904,Kathryn,"This flat is impeccably decorated and in an amazing location in Le Marais. Walk everywhere no need for a taxi.  Maria was an excellent host and was waiting for us when we arrived.  She was very thorough and helpful.
The only drawback to this flat is also what makes it beautiful; the precious antique furniture and 
decor including the countertops.  I spent a great deal of time wiping up water spots on the wood countertops (including bathroom) so as not to leave an H2O stain.  I started to resent it a bit to be honest as I clean a lot at home. This flat would NOT be suitable for a bachelor party. But again this is a beautiful flat in a vibrant neighborhood. PS do not go to L'Open Cafe as they stare at you blankly if you don't speak French.  How stereotypical they are. I ended up with no food only eating bread as they refused to help me. "

While there is an elevator it is quite small so really it’s best used for hauling luggage up to the apartment or maybe 2-3 people max (it is on 4th floor). There is also a metro stop right outside of the building which made getting around a breeze. Overall a very good experience!

The location was amazing about a 30 second walk from a metro stop. JP was easy to get into contact with upon arrival and departure and also available during our stay although the apartment was perfect so we didn't really need to contact him. Will be recommending to friends of ours that are going to Paris soon. Thank you JP!

The large living room has amazing natural light from the tall windows. Fast WiFi quite bedroom hot water and good pressure adequate kitchen and laundry were all nice perks though we did have to purchase shampoo soap and detergent for our 4-night stay.  I would recommend this apartment to friends.
14368316,134063105,2017-02-26,86793232,Aurora,La habitación está muy bien equipada y muy cerca del metro además puedes llegar caminando al cementerio père Lachaise. Hay varios lugares para comer cerca y Amel es muy amable y te orienta en todas las dudas. Lo único malo es que no hay Internet. Pero en la mayoría de los restaurantes y museos así como en algunas estaciones del metro puedes conectarte.
6365451,35044989,2015-06-14,16589874,Geoffrey,"Appartement bien situé proche métro et bien desservi. Très propre rénové. 2 bon couchages. Quartier relativement calme
Seul bémol qui pourrait être précisé dans la description ou qui pourrait être amélioré. Une des parois de la douche est une fenêtre qui donne sur la quartier. Malgré l'éloignement relatif des immeubles voisins et la position en étage de l'appartement cela manque cruellement d'intimité. Après on se douche avec Paris ça nous a bien fait rire mais un rideau de douche ou des films opaques autocollants sur la vitre suffiraient ! A prévoir 
sinon Acceuil impeccable et ponctuel. 
Mis à part ce petit point sur la douche je recommande

Léa est une hôte exceptionnelle et une personne très accueillante et ouverte d’esprit - et son père aussi qui est venu récupérer les clés au check out: c’était un plaisir de converser avec eux on les a adorés ! Sa maison est un petit nid de beauté qui se trouve au sixième étage (sans ascenseur mais ça fait du bien ;)) dans un très bel immeuble du bas Montmartre. Très bien aménagé l’appartement est spacieux et lumineux avec une vue magnifique sur les environs. En plus il est situé dans une position absolument stratégique: à mi-chemin entre le Sacré-Cœur et la Porte de Clignancourt (tous les deux à distance de marche) et juste en face du métro Simplon ce qui est parfait pour tout déplacement ! Donc je ne peux que remercier Léa encore une fois pour sa gentillesse et recommander vivement son logement !

The ia not toilet inside apparrment there is only shower. Toilet is shared and located in the second A side of building. its very uncomfortable. Also walls are very tiny and you can hear eveything from neighbours. Some of them are too noisy . so they are disturbing. Romaric is very irresponsible he sent every detail and replys quickly. dispute that it was great to stay therem The apparent was clean.
561567,8340333,2013-10-26,5299987,Antoinette,"I was in Paris for business and pleasure and in general this apartment served its purpose.
Renaud is very quick to respond super helpful and kind.

The apartment is very clean and minimal with a well equipped for cooking. No kettle or pot deep enough to boil water.Only a filter coffee machine which means stocking up on filter coffee not that easy to find in the close area.
There is no place to hang clothing or coats.

Working in the apartment was not a huge success due to the lack of comfortable seating and extremely uncomfortable sofa bed as well as not being able to open widows as the noise from traffic from below was insane. 

On a possitive note the location is brilliant close to the best areas in Paris and very good metro links.
The entrance of the building is beautiful and the lift to the top floor is a huge bonus.

All in all the host was great but the apartment is too uncomfortable impersonal and not great value for money.

I would have liked to tell Renaud this face to face but did not see him on checking out hence I had no choice but to write this honey review.

It's a nice and lovely house and he also has a very nice roommate. I wish we could stay a few more days and I would like to recommend his house to other tourists. 
23845814,544521548,2019-10-10,48613154,Natalie,Location is great and Lucas was quick to respond. Stove was either broken or we just needed troubleshooting assistance but Lucas wasn’t able to assist. We booked Air BnB to have kitchen access so it was a bit disappointing to buy €40 of food and only get to use half of it. The area felt safe but it was a rough sleep. We were woken up by loud banging in the building a couple nights which was creepy but thankfully it wasn’t on our door.
35278806,534930513,2019-09-23,97611153,Curtis,Wonderful location at Palais-Royal walking distance to a couple of Metro stations as well as the Louvre. The bathroom is quite spacious. For European standards the studio apartment is decently sized good for about 2 people. It may not fit the American standard for large spacious rooms but it’s a great base of operations for a Paris adventure. Tony is prompt with communication if you ever need to ask any questions. I would stay here again if I were to go back to Paris.

Strategically located few metres away only from arc de triomph. Good amenities good security for the apartment and really value for money!! Good for family with small kids too.
13558212,475470287,2019-06-24,13807956,Stefania,L'appartamento corrisponde alla descrizione e alle foto. E' centrale ben collegato luminoso e tranquillo.

Consigliato: ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo.
1596250,97983685,2016-08-29,55950352,Pavel,Я путешествовал с моей супругой. Сразу как мы въехали мы неожиданно обнаружили в нашей комнате арома-лампу с запахом имбиря вся комната была пропитана этим запахом. Мы отнесли лампу Натаниелю но в течение последующих трех дней запах ослаб лишь незначительно. Кроме того огорчил беспорядок на кухне и в гостиной такой что мы избегали там находится. Очень плохое освещение для комнаты на первом этаже с единственным окном во внутренний двор. Из плюсов - наличие сушильной машины.

1724490,193125547,2017-09-12,94829055,Olivia,This apartment was a real gem - everything you need within walking distance of most of the major sights (with a metro round the corner to access anything further away). The beds (including sofa-bed) were comfortable and everything was clean and in good working order. At first sight the area looks a little dodgy but we certainly had no issues and the street is nice and quiet!  Giorgio was very communicative and provided us with comprehensive notes on the flat and the neighbourhood. Highly recommended!
24878086,295865337,2018-07-24,158883766,Cherry,"Anne is a very thoughtful and lovely host. Even though I didn’t meet her in person she gave me clear steps to get the key and always replied my messages in time. 
The room is very clean and cozy simple but kinda elegant. The garden is full of plants and life. 
It’s just that you will hear people once in a while passing by your room in the garden so maybe you can check with Anne about it before making the payment if you really mind that. 
It’s 7 mins walk to Porte de Vincennes and about 12 mins from nation. There’s a carrefour express next door. Very convenient. 
I highly recommend it. And it’s very likely that I’ll come back next time. It’s a great experience"

28486278,473248776,2019-06-21,250685717,Nancy,This was a fabulous place to stay.  The location is perfect - right in the heart of the action of the 6th arrondissement yet the apartment is quiet.   The room and bathroom were very private and absolutely spotless.  The bedroom is actually nicer than the profile photo; it was recently beautifully renovated and there is a large window.  The hosts are lovely people who made me feel like a member of the family.  They provided many helpful tips on navigating the area and the city.  They also provided many amenities such as breakfast extra toiletries and towels and a fan in the room.  So thoughtful so caring.  I will definitely try to stay with them again when I return to Paris.

Throughout the booking process she was very helpful and accommodating about all my queries and requests. I was worried about the Paris heatwave so much so that she thoughtfully bought a new electric fan!

If you're seeking a more local experience Maylis' place is easily the most comfortable and convenient I've ever stayed in the 10th with its access to the metro and a lot of great restaurants and cafés. I'd definitely rebook here when I'm Paris again."

Great neighborhood with good food and cafe. The Wifi was a bit slow during my stay and the noise isolation between apartments weren't perfect. Otherwise it is a very good stay! Thierry responds very fast and is very accommodative!

Cependant la minceur des murs de l'appartement n'enlève rien à son charme et sa position privilégiée pour visiter Paris ! Très joli séjour.
4708051,461923730,2019-06-01,242687705,Kate,"We've got a very mixed fillings while staying at this place. On one side : excellent location metro across the street grocery shops 2 mins walk Eiffel Tower  - 7-10 min walking distance. Flexible move-in / out times. Very helpful and responsive host.
On the other side - apartment needs a very(!) good cleaning specially common areas - like washroom toilet and kitchen. 
Also just a side note: sleeping on sofa bed literally means sleeping on a floor as you have to put sofa cushions on a floor."
20041971,196800752,2017-09-24,84048223,Riyaad,The apartment is ideally positioned if you want to stay in St. Germain. Secluded enough that you can get a decent night's sleep but positioned in the midst of all the action. Some great restaurants within a short walk as are a number of the sights Paris is famous for. It was great to have two bathrooms as well though there is only one loo. No kidding about the lift though. It's four floors of solid climbing - but it'll help to work off all of the gastronomic indulgences. No complaints - by Parisian standards the size is decent!

La fermata metro è il fiore all'occhiello di questo appartamento proprio perché si trova a 8 metri dal portone d'ingresso.
L'ubicazione è centralissima ed offre la possibilità di visitare gran parte del centro di Parigisenza dover utilizzare i mezzi pubblici (Notre Dame e Museo Pompidou  a 5 minuti a piediMuseo del Louvre a 15 minuti di camminatama soprattutto il quartiere Le Marais si sviluppa alle spalle dell'appartamento ed è perfetto anche per la vita notturna).
L'alloggio è davvero ridotto (più di quanto immaginavo)ma è dotato di tutto ciò che serve per vivere e Marie è stata gentilissima facendoci trovare stoviglie e posate a disposizionefornetto a microondeun aspirapolveresacchetti per la spazzatura e saponi per il bagno.
Se avete voglia di muovervi a piedirimanendo in posizione centralequesto alloggio è ideale e Marie è una persona molto gentile e disponibile.

He helped us become acquainted with the area and met us directly outside of our tram stop after having given us incredible directions from Porte Maillot.

Beautiful location close proximity to different sites gardens and restaurants. The flat is lovely and clean. Thank you so much Clément!

7192724,503683731,2019-08-06,228423871,Brooke,Wow! My friend and I felt so lucky to be able to stay with Vera on our first trip to Paris. She was such a blessing along with her sweet sister. She explained the ins-and-outs of Paris to us making everything seem so clear including the metro. Throughout the whole stay and before she was a great communicator. We even dealt with delayed luggage and with the help of Vera we were able to get it shipped to her apartment. Also I would recommend bringing some earplugs to sleep as it does get loud which is pretty common throughout the city. I would highly recommend staying with Vera on your trip to Paris. Merci beaucoup Vera!

Although we didn't meet Dimitra in person the communication with her went perfectly smooth via Airbnb and she offered us great tips for the city. We arrived easily at the centrally located apartment just minutes away from Le Marais Pompidou Centre and the Louvre. 

The place is fully-equipped with all needed and has a real Parisian authentic atmosphere. Even though the bedrooms felt small because of the diagonal walls next to the beds they will fit well for a couple or even two.

To sum up were very satisfied from the place and would highly recommend it!"

It is very clean and warm and the kitchen has all the amenities that is necessary. Although Ruth was not around she always asked if we were enjoying our stay and if we needed something extra. The check in/out was really easy and the person came on time to collect the keys. I will definetly consider Ruth’s appartment for another stay in Paris!

Sorry for some cry from my baby in some night and in morning. The location is great which close to Metro ( De pompe) approximately 3-5 min by walk as well as close to Trocadero Metro (7-10 mins by walk). This place is also save at the night. 
11152609,292450813,2018-07-18,156902425,Deborah,"My boyfriend and I traveled to Paris recently to celebrate my 50th birthday. We had wanted a special experience and the Notre Dame apartment on rue Galande delivered in every possible way! Reserving the apartment was a breeze and Michel was very thorough  in the information he forwarded to us. 

The apartment is on a small street on the Left Bank next to a charming pair of medieval buildings. A four digit code unlocks the door downstairs then there is a hall a few stairs a small elevator and few more stairs to the unit itself. We accessed the key by using another code in a lockbox just outside the door. It’s a bit challenging to navigate the stairs and the tiny elevator with luggage but it’s rare to have an elevator in Paris at all and the view more than makes up for it! 

The apartment itself is well-represented by the pictures that Michel posted. The art wall with antique paintings of Notre Dame is elegant and the mirrors on the opposite side make the apartment feel even more spacious. There is an abundance of storage space and the guidebooks on the bookshelf were a nice touch. We didn’t cook at all in the kitchen but we found the full size refrigerator useful and we used the washer/dryer once. We were in Paris during a warm spell in July and the air conditioning worked perfectly.

The view out the windows in the apartment is stunning and when it’s cool enough to turn the AC off and leave the windows open you can enjoy the sound of church bells. There is a grocery store nearby a small park across the street and Shakespeare & Company bookshop just around the corner. We walked much of the time but also used the metro extensively. Several stops are close by including St-Michel Notre Dame and Cluny La Sorbonne. The apartment is also quite close to the RER B which makes travel to and from the airport easy.   

I’ve traveled extensively in Europe and been to Paris a number of times before but our experience here truly stands out—it was elegant intimate and exceptional. Thank you Michel!

Het bed beneden maakt wel een metalen geluid bij elke beweging. De locatie is wel prima volop in het centrum van de Marais wat 's nachts wel wat geluidsoverlast meebrengt .

32696994,465789586,2019-06-08,57151917,Kristen,The location here is great however not worth the money. The plumbing is a mess. When you flush the toilet water backs up in the kitchen sink and the smell of sewer gas in the apartment is overwhelming.  If these issues were fixed this would be a good place to stay
16117580,430962728,2019-03-31,235803362,Gregory,"We had a wonderful time staying in the home which is perfectly located for central Paris sightseeing.  Anna Jacqueline and Daniela with whom we dealt most directly were both friendly and responsive.
The apartment is large very nice comfortable and convenient.  All amenities worked as advertised which allowed us to have breakfast at home before going out for the day.  The living room is quite comfortable and we had glasses of wine and snacks on several occasions.  
The only issue we had was construction during the day (starting at 8 a.m.) in the apartment below which resulted in very loud drilling and hammering that was difficult to escape.  While this was clearly out of Anna Jacqueline's control it did impact our experience in the apartment in the morning and when we were trying to rest during a couple of afternoons.  
After raising the issue a couple of times the apartment owners made an accommodation to ease our inconvenience which we appreciated.
As others have written the elevator is not reliable (did not work during our entire stay) so be prepared to walk three flights of stairs regularly.  This was not a big deal for us but just be aware of this situation.
We kept the windows open to enjoy the nice weather and fresh air including through the night.  Two weekend nights during our stay there was late night partying going on at the restaurant below the apartment and from another apartment across the street.  Closing the windows helped but again something to take into consideration.
We would DEFINITELY stay in the apartment again due to the location size and amenities of the apartment.  Thank you for helping make our Paris vacation special!"

Bathroom and elevator very small but likely common for Paris. Portable AC unit which requires you to leave balcony door open to allow the heat from the pipe to escape...didn’t like that it allowed bugs to come in. Overall a pretty decent stay and location was the best!

Had two sofa beds so was nice to have 3 beds between 4 of us. Front door was difficult to get open. Had to have two of us open the door but that wasn't really any issue once you got the hang of it. Check in and communication was great. The only other thing to mention is there is a door that joins to next doors hallway which is locked but you can hear next door really well that it feels like they are in your apartment. 
But was exactly what we needed for our business trip so no complaints :)"

It's very centrally located and we had no problems getting to any place in the city via the metro.

The only thing I would complain is that since it is situated behind two restaurants it can get a bit noisy through the walls.  We were out most of the day so it wasn't an inconvenience but not great for nap time!

Our host Peter was truly the best - he responded quickly to all of our questions & accommodated our special requests. He gave us excellent local tips.  He checked on us mid-week to make sure everything was going well and reminded us that he was available should we need anything.  The wifi was strong and worked well.  Although we did not cook the kitchen is fully equipped - we only made coffee every morning and ran down the street to Kayser Bakery for excellent pastries  (suggested by Peter).  Check in and out was simple. The apartment had everything we needed for an awesome 8 day vacation in Paris and we cannot wait to return.   We would definitely rent this apartment again!  THANKS again Peter!!

The hotel is clean and quiet and the hosts very nice and friendly. I definitely recommend and would enjoy staying there again...
3516335,147914502,2017-04-29,96227874,Melanie,This place is in a wonderful location. Very close to the metro and to great restaurants. Laurent was always available to communicate and helpful. When we were late getting in his mother was there to give us a tour of the apartment and let us store our bags prior to check in. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were all great (even the towels!). One thing to point out is that you could hear people above you walking around but not too bad. Definitely recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Paris!! 
5029618,91164930,2016-08-04,67739022,Dan,"Die Lager der Wohnung ist sensationell. Eine Treppe von Sacré Coeur entfernt ist man mitten in Paris. Das Cafe/Restaurant unten hat uns gar nicht gestört. Bei offenem Fenster kann man oben in der Wohnung mit einer Flasche Wein die Füße hochlegen und das Treiben unten auf dem Platz genießen. Sobald die Fenster geschlossen sind hört man fast nichts mehr! 
Das Apartement ist sehr tredny und geschmackvoll eingerichtet die Böden knatschen - dem Alter entsprechen- ordentlich! Eben ein richtiger Altbau!
Einziger negativer Aspekt waren die ""2 Schlafzimmer"". Tatsächlich handelt es sich um ein nachträglich abgetrenntes zweites Zimmer. Die auf den Photos sichtbaren Fenster trennen die Zimmer optisch voneinander akustisch allerdings nicht wirklich. Auch wenn alle Fenster geschlossen sind kann man alles aus dem Nachbarzimmer hören. Die Couch im Wohnzimmer ist alt und löchrig - da wir sie aber eh nicht als Schlafplatz benötigt haben hat uns das nicht gestört.
Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und die Betten sehr bequem.
Alles in allem machte die Wohnung eher den Eindruck einer Ferienwohnung als die einer Privatwohnung. Nathalie haben wir nicht gesehen. Als plötzlich über Nacht das Wasser weg war - in der Nachbarwohnung hatte es einen Wasserrohrbruch gegeben - war sie über Email zu erreichen und hat schnell auf unser Problem reagiert. "

Marilane was very helpful communicated clearly and was there to greet us when we reached the apartment. 
If you are a couple and choosing to stay in Montmartre area in Paris this would be an ideal pick."

On the front the street is very busy but at the back where the bedrooms are it is very peaceful and quiet so sleeping with an open window isn't any problem at all.
It all looks exactly as shown on the pictures.

Arthur is a friendly young and very undertaking guy!
The communication was very quick also during our stay.
He's very flexible and tries to find a solution for all your wishes.

If you come by car the underground parking in the building is a big surplus!

There is only 1 thing that can make this place just perfect:

Better cleaning ( I discussed this with Arthur himself it would just make this a perfect place with 5 stars)

I would definitely recommend this place!
We had a great stay!
Thanks Arthur!

569891,490318792,2019-07-18,12922594,Lasse Askefrø,"We had a fantastic time at Bertos apartment. It´s situated in a very picturesque and quiet yard.
Luckily for us – in this very hot summer - the big windows are facing north.
The apartment had everything we needed for cooking and relaxing.
The residential is full of small shops and cafes. If you like organic food you should try the Franprix in rue Alexandre Parodi and the bioshop in Rue de Lancry.
The morning walk with our dog along the canal was a lovely start for the day. Just down the canal there is a little spot where the dogs can walk free and say hello.
The communication with Berto was excellent.  He quickly gave answers to our questions and always with supporting information’s – thanks’ for that Berto.
We give Berto our best recommendations as a host and when we come back to Paris – and we always come back to this lovely capitol – we will for sure ask for Bertos apartment.

19571604,512287512,2019-08-18,184880762,Frank,"Positives: A quiet place. A few short steps to a metro stop. Easy self check-in. And you are in Paris!
Negatives: Apartment layout did not offer privacy (we are 2 parents with 2 college-age children). We got interrupted if someone needed to wash their hands or brush teeth.  Sleeper sofa had no sheet. No curtains on window for the sofa sleeper. The toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned. No space in the refrigerator for us as it was full of his opened containers. There were clothes in the washer/dryer so we could not use. No idea whose clothes they were. WiFi came and went a few times. (We didn't come to Paris to hang out in the apartment so all we did was sleep there. The issues were tolerable for a short stay.)"

21202531,522548127,2019-09-02,17691928,Stephanie,Great location bars and restaurants all around.  A bit loud on the weekends if your window's open but when closed very minimal noise.  Bed was comfy bathroom was clean.  Halls in the hotel are very narrow ithought it added to the charm. But if I would have brought my full-size pushchair I would not have been able to get it to my room. 3ish parking spaces in front on the street. Need to book in advance though
35591101,511300183,2019-08-17,285067069,Flamelike.,C’est une petite chambre mais complètemalheureusement la toilette est un peu petitemais c’est pas gravej’aime bien encore!

1347693,192450249,2017-09-10,4561590,Dawn,"The apartment was just as the description mentioned. It's walking distance to EVERYTHING!!  There's also a Velib bike rack within a block of the apartment. It was helpful renting a bike for the day rather than having to walk all of the time or take the metro. The bike rental per day is just 170 €

Laurence is the best host!  There is literally any ethnic food you might want to eat right downstairs from the apartment. There's a great bakery on the corner and two great gelato spots around the corner. And evrything is open really late. 

There's a vibrant night life EVERY night. However the apartment is incredibly insulated from the noise.  The apartment is quiet and clean. This apartment is a jewel. It is tiny but it is very cozy. It was perfect for me. 

I have to say the internet did not work for me it didn't work on my iphone and it didn't work on my tablet. So that was a bummer and a big disappointment. It wasn't just spotty connection the network that was suggested to use rarely would even come up as a network choice. But other than that I really liked the apartment and would stay there again.

Also remember to bring your own body wash and wash cloth.  Towels are provided. 

Great location responsive host!"

Emma is an accommodating thoughtful and kind host. Just be clear about when you are checking in and when you are leaving (in writing) so there is no confusion. It is not a luxury place but it has all the basics that you could need: shower nice bed T.V. (very limited channels) kitchen washing machine. The couch is not comfortable the bedroom/bathroom ceiling is very low hanging. I think it could be a great apartment with some remodeling comfortable furniture and access to the terrace that is right outside. "

The room however was not as we though it would be but the description was not inaccurate as such. Also the sofa bed was really noisy any slight movement will make a big noise.

Even the train to the airport is just a couple of minutes walk.  The only downside is the apartment is above a few bars and at night it was quite noisy until late.  On Saturday night it definitely interrupted sleep.  Otherwise a great place and Jean and Bernadette were very responsive and check-in / check-out was very easy.

The space is warm clean bright and is decorated with style and artistic flair!
Our flight transfer was delayed and Caroline patiently waited for us to arrive an hour and a half later than scheduled which we were very grateful for. We were given a warm welcome with some crisps and biscuits and juice for the children and milk for the very important cup of tea! 
The flat is ideally situated in the heart of lovely area with cheese chocolatebread and butcher shops - even a lovely fishmonger just around the corner.
In walking distance to Abbesses and Sacre Coeur and butte de Montmartre. Metro Jules Joffrin just a five minute walk away. 
Caroline also has a folder filled to the brim of local information for the savvy traveller and it was great to have that at our disposal.
We are looking forward to our next stay chez Caroline.

She was very efficient and helpful in answering to all of our questions and giving information about the transports and the places to visit. Since our return flight was late in the evening she was so kind that she kept our luggage at her stay during the last day so that we could still visit Paris. The flat is very close to the metro station Gambetta and from there you can easily reach all the places in Paris. The flat is clean comfortable and very nice. Merci beaucoup for your kindness Yamna.

20045459,478560872,2019-06-30,265814910,Maddie,"Extremely disappointed with the lack of communication and ability to fix a problem that should have been remediated before my stay.

We booked this place knowing that a heatwave was about to hit Paris (highs in the high 90s) and spent an arm and a leg to ensure that we would have air conditioning for the weekend. *Note! This is not a single apartment it is a floor of apartments that is operated by a company in what appeared to be an office building.

We checked in at 3 on Thursday excited to shower and sit inside after a long day of walking around. We waited an hour for the a/c to turn on finding out it didn’t work sent a message through Airbnb to remedy it didn’t get a clear response called their office and said they would get on it...for a slippery slope of messages that ended in a “couldn’t be done that day.” I asked for a fan for the night—which also couldn’t be done. So we slept in a 90 degree room for a night and when we got a small fan the next day were told by a staff member “ya we don’t know why it’s not working.” Spent all day Friday waiting for an update only to get the same “We will contact our maintenance manager” by a few different people to have the same outcome NOTHING. By SATURDAY night we gave up because we were leaving on Sunday. 

I’m not one to complain but we booked this place only because it had a/c and paid a lot more money for that amenity to not work or get fixed. Three nights sleeping in a non-air conditioned room during a heat wave was unbearable. For a company that boasted about their customer service we were disappointed in the service and lack of communication by everyone. 

Beware: if there is a glaring issue with your room they most likely won’t fix it or refund you for the amenity you paid for. Such a shame for my first visit to Paris..."

I recommend not to bring big suitcases as they take up a lot of space in the apartment. It’s a small place but there were several cafes right by and in case you’re driving there’s a parking across the street (paid).

35408521,535310541,2019-09-24,112411931,Becca,Wow! Kamlia’s apartment was everything my family and I could’ve asked for! From the beginning the communication was very clear (which as a foreign traveler was super important!) The location was central to so many amazing tourists attractions but I particularly loved what a lively and fun part of the city we were in. So many great restaurants shops and pubs located right below us. We even took advantage of the laundry mat right below which only costs a few euros. The apartment was gorgeous. Just like the pictures stylish and a great home of amenities and beautiful open windows we had open all the time. Would definitely recommend and hope to be back again!

215763,313870098,2018-08-26,91341842,Irina,Franck has a wonderful apartments - very stylish and smart organized. I use to live in Paris anyway his guide about the neighborhood was very well made and helpful. We had only one problem - 6 floor  spiral staircase no elevator and 80 kg of luggage so we spent almost 30 minutes with my mom to carry it upstairs ))) But probably it’s my fault that i didn’t check before a reservation on which floor the apartments are located.
2110598,15224976,2014-07-05,4393510,Meghan,This is a great apartment in a perfect central location just a couple blocks south of the Seine.  We traveled as two couples with one couple in the bedroom and the other on the sofabed in the living room.  We all had plenty of room and the sofa bed was very comfortable!  The kitchen and bathroom are both updated and very clean.  We traveled in July during a very warm week and the apartment stayed wonderfully cool.  In the morning and evening we would open the two double french doors in the living room and bedroom and relax with our coffee.  Nora is a great host even leaving us wine bottled water bread and other staples in the fridge for our stay.  There are quite a few stairs to the apartment itself (4th level with no elevator) so people with mobility problems might want to stay elsewhere but the stairs are not particularly steep and so would not be challenging for most.  The building itself is charming and very secure.  All in all a wonderful place to stay.  
20914184,247343197,2018-03-28,28611617,Georgina,We really loved Laurent and Audrey’s flat - it is stylish well assembled and in a great location. Laurent and Audrey were flexible with checking in and out and very quick to respond with our queries.
19538934,207498991,2017-10-29,135559092,Camilla,Perfect place if you're spending a couple of days in Paris. Perfect location just a couple of minutes walking from the champs elysee and amazing view from the window. The space is small but cozy it's on the 7th floor of a building with a very small lift the cooking area is very small and there is not a table to eat so it's not ideal if you're planning to eat at home. Overall it's a good studio worth its price and Jean-Michel was a really nice host.

9851851,108932452,2016-10-18,43302781,Colin,"The apartment was quirky and very comfortable.  There is a small lift that makes accessing the 5th floor easy which is a big plus .  
It is located in an excellent district close to all transport (near Gare du Lyon metro bus etc).  It is also very close or easy to get to the various sights museums etc of Paris. There are good restaurants nearby.
Although Benmoine was not available to greet us we did eventually work out how to access the building etc.
All in all a fun good value for money place to stay.  Thank you Benmoine."

There is a vibrant market downstairs which adds to the atmosphere. It is centrally located to everything and very near 3 train stations.

The kitchen and bathroom are tiny. The bed is in a sleeping loft. Annabelle met me at the front door and she showed me around the apartment and the building. She was very nice and pointed out places to go for dinner locally and where the grocery store is.
2444138,289872107,2018-07-13,117208104,Hiba,Gilian was very good with communication and his apartment (room) was very clean. It is a small space but we managed as a family of 4. The location is great.   We traveled in the first week of July which had temperatures between 26-29C which made the room very hot. Gilian did let us know that the temperatures were higher than normal. A fan was available in the  room which provided some heat relief. However  with 4 people staying in a single room and windows that only partially opened heat trapped in the room and we all struggled to sleep. For the price we paid I had hoped to have better experience.
18369531,414296734,2019-02-19,57932779,Lizzie,The apartment is a great and stylish base for a stay in Paris with everything you need included and Laurence is a really helpful host.

1410402,12398866,2014-05-01,2912841,Patrick,I stayed recently in Luca's studio. Communication with Luca was fine and he was there to explain us everything when we arrived. The studio is in a excellent location where everything is really nearby. My only concern is that it needs a serious decluttering and especially a good spring cleaning with loads of fresh air all desperately needed. I noticed there was a review from some guests with a dog well I can certify its true as I found loads of dog hair around the flat....

11087370,77138158,2016-05-30,9811929,Yacine,Une excellente situation  un appartement vaste et lumineux.  Un hôte très attentionné et serviable. Je pense qu'il faudrait remplacer les draps les oreillers et les serviettes de bain. Le contrôle sur l'état d'hygiène dans lequel les voyageurs laissent la vaisselle et autres ustensiles devrait être plus rigoureux.  Mais cette dernière remarque s'adresse à la communauté airbnb en entier. Et Alexandre en a pris note et je suis sûr que c'est déjà fait.
20745368,194252216,2017-09-16,147506614,Angela,Very new place with all the facilities. Right opposite the supermarket and a couple of minutes from the Metro. It was super easy to move from and to. Thank you again!
3192775,503073957,2019-08-05,67278169,Pia,"The pictures do not do this place justice! Our group of 6 (4 adults and 2 children) had an amazing time staying at Greg & Thibault’s home for 7 days.

The home is quiet private huge and very stylish. We were exceptionally comfortable and were really able to spread out and make ourselves at home.

The location is great! You can see the top of the Sacre Coeur from the end of the street and hear its bells chime. It is a short walk to the Montmartre Butte Metro grocery store and plenty of restaurants - we were daily visitors at the bakery and made it a ritual to get fresh bread and croissants for breakfast everyday.

Greg and Thibault gave great instructions to access the home and were quick to respond to any queries. I highly highly recommend this home!!!"

C'est un excellent rapport qualité/prix pour visiter Paris !"
1588792,16468803,2014-07-28,16237556,Cyrill,Olivier & Mathieu sind sehr nett und freundlich. Wir haben mit Ihnen gute Gespräche führen können. Und die Wohnung in der sie wohnen ist sehr schön und mit einem tollen Geschmack eingerichtet. Die Umgebung ist super. Es hat viele Läden Bars und Restaurants. Und die U-Bahn ist ganz in der nähe. Es gibt viel zu entdecken. Der Aufenthalt in der Wohnung ist sehr angenehm.

798938,10179341,2014-02-04,10972158,Sara,"El apartamento es tal y como aparece en las fotos incluso el baño es más grande de lo q parece. Es un lugar estupendo para pasar unos días en París una persona o pareja. La zona es muy buena con un supermercado cerca y algunas tiendas muy útiles. A Françoise no la conocimos en persona pero fue muy muy agradable por email. Dejó a una persona encargada de darnos las llaves y explicarnos todo necesitamos otra toalla y nos la dio enseguida. Es verdad que el colchón no es como el de una cama pero es un sofá cama! Con el cansancio de todo el día visitando París no supone un problema.
Recomiendo este apartamento y cuando volvamos repetiremos!"
7169503,347353914,2018-11-11,2992117,Sophie,"Living in this place made my 6-week stay in Paris so much better. I really felt at home in this very compact and functional apartment. Although the apartment is very cute it was also very functional with a desk to work on perfect wifi plenty of storage a modern kitchen and a washing machine. 
What I most appreciated was the quiet building and street: I've lived in many areas of Paris in the last 10 years and really appreciated the quiet street (very little cars) and the respectful and disciplined neighbours: even though the walls are obviously thin I heard no music and no TV at anytime during my stay.
Dealing with Roxane was always easy and I had no issue whatsoever with any aspect of the apartment."
3279507,137411579,2017-03-15,43635209,Lindsay,We loved staying here.  The location is pefect for metro grocery laundry and restaurants.  The neighborhood is very safe.  It is only 15-20 minutes by metro to all the major tourist sites.  The kitchen was perfect and had everything we needed to cook meals for our group of four.  Charlotte was a delightful host and made herself accessible for our needs. Marc always responded promptly during our pre vacation communications. We highly recommend this apartment if you want to see Paris.
27217645,513991438,2019-08-20,213516011,Rob,Great location at a very affordable price. Would recommend to anyone who wishes to do a short stay in Paris.
18676766,296983454,2018-07-27,72323194,Tracey,Very stylish and clean apartment near the Bastille area of Paris. Access to many many cafes and taverns down the street. Pierre was easy to communicate with and very responsive. Beds were very comfortable. 
20531222,225701817,2018-01-07,11787813,Raffael + Nitya,Stylish and very central room in Marais. Communication with Charles was perfect we can totally recommend the place.

3814346,411377712,2019-02-12,561182,Kari,I am happy to add my five-star review to Tin & Thuy's apartment listing. They are wonderful hosts. The apartment was well appointed and well stocked and we appreciated very much the fresh fruit. The building is unusual in that it's narrow so the apartment has windows and light on both sides and a balcony. Nicely furnished and homey we had everything we needed for a very pleasant stay. The area is near Tolbiac with grocery stores boulangeries patisseries and restaurants galore. We enjoyed meeting Tin & Thuy they were very thorough and helpful in explaining everything. (Apologies again for arriving early - I've never gotten through customs at CDG and then on the train and into Paris so quickly!!) I would be pleased to stay here again on a future trip.
23107504,470599211,2019-06-16,133255805,Anna Petra,Perfect place for 3-4 people near to the city centre

277555,10430321,2014-02-18,6984151,Julia,Nancy was abroad when my mom and I stayed at her place but Massimo was there and he was fantastic! The room is spacious and so is the bed (we shared). It's also very comfortable. We wanted to save some money too so Massimo was great with allowing us to make dinner every night in the place. Such a cost savings! Metro stop is right outside the building for line 9 so it's also incredibly easy to get around to all of the sites. Highly recommend!
32518543,493864292,2019-07-23,64165238,Brian,This was a good stop if you are staying over no more than 2 nights and need a quick place to stay. Not a bad area but not A/C and middle of the summer is extremely hot. I understand they are old buildings but some type of unit needs to be put in place to calm customers. Other than that no issues. Small space. Recommended for 2 people or less.
19515575,216239992,2017-12-03,125341725,Elsa,L'appartement a une super décoration idéalement placé dans Pigalle et nos hôtes ont été charmant !

33210,213442986,2017-11-21,2127616,Julia,Location is perfect! We stayed a month at Karen's place. The studio apartment is small but functional and a very good base to explore Paris. We walked everywhere lots of things to see close by even we walked to the Eiffel Tower. Communications with Karen is always prompt. Wifi was fast and reliable the shower was good. I recommend Karen's place to anyone visiting Paris. Thanks Karen!

We were fine with the stairs up to the flat helped burn off the croissant calories but might be a challenge to anyone with any kind of mobility issues
15386851,221896053,2017-12-28,158921104,Arthur,Muito boa estadia recomendo a todos que querem um local em Paris perto de um metrô e com ótima relação qualidade/preço.

565143,482385250,2019-07-06,127933226,Kishore,The place is close to center and is good if you are planning to spend a lot of time out of the room. The room is basic and small and 3 bathrooms shared for more than 10 rooms.

3528151,532100742,2019-09-19,219095859,Elaine,For five weeks I lived in Paris in Marika's lovely apartment and I truly felt immersed in the culture and lifestyle. Marika explained the apartment workings and the neighborhood to me and was there whenever I needed her. This beautiful spacious apartment is so well equipped so perfectly located and was ideal for me when I was alone or had guests. I could walk to the left bank or the Louvre or just five minutes away enjoy Parc Monceau (a mini Central Park) and the local museums. Restaurants and cafes patisseries pharmacies boulangeries fromageries  the monoprix-all are within a few minutes walk. The metro another 4 minute walk takes you everywhere-inside Paris and beyond. I felt perfectly safe during the day and late at night. I loved every minute of my sojourn in Paris and particularly living at 130 Boulevard Malesherbes.
846954,498110919,2019-07-29,186167973,Bel,"We had a lovely stay at Maguy’s place. The room was spacious and bright and very clean. Tea coffee baguettes and jam were out for us in the morning - very sweet. 

Great location a number of cute cafes restaurants and boutiques nearby."
607523,41226851,2015-08-05,27783940,Andreas,Die Wohnung war freundlich und sauber und die Einrichtung war wie auf den Bildern gezeigt. Die Schlüsselübergabe hat  perfekt geklappt. Stephane war immer erreichbar und hat hilfreiche Tipps gegeben. Die Lage ist in einem trendigen Stadtteil und bietet viele Ausgehmöglichkeiten. immer gerne wieder!! 
6542352,342669964,2018-10-29,97309445,Suny,The apartment is super cute and clean. Only thing to keep in mind is that it’s on the 5th floor with no lift. It’s in a great location in China town with lots of restaurants and a small grocery store just walking distance. The metro station is right on the corner and a 10 min ride to any major tourist attraction. Patricia was super responsive and provided some great recommendations. We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend!
20030333,252400394,2018-04-10,130826402,Enrique,Super-charming place to stay. The pics don't do justice to how lovely it is to see the Seine and the Louvre out your windows. We used the nespresso machine a lot and the washer once. Could not be better located for tourism. Get a museum pass so you can go back to the Louvre in the evenings. Some of the ceilings are a bit low for a tall fellow but worth it!
9124345,117149799,2016-12-05,2854288,Cecilia,It has a perfect location and the place made me feels home. I love it and will definitely stay in Mallory' s apartment again if visiting Paris in the future.
43027,1462185,2012-06-11,118768,Philipp,"We had a great weekend in Paris and a wonderful stay in Charlottes apartment. The apartment is exactly as nice as in the pictures and Charlotte is just the perfect host. She had a lot of helpful tips about the area and knows very good places to eat shop and visit. I especially have to mention her recommendations on bakeries in Paris - we had probably the best croissants in our entire life and are missing the fresh baked bread...   

Some other guests already mentioned the cats. They are really adorable. During our stay they were sometimes a little bit too active at night and were chasing each other through the whole apartment. But we got used to it and if you like cats this won´t be a problem..."

12725313,163287599,2017-06-24,16091343,Derek,"Overall the stay was enjoyable. The apartment is very close to the Chatelet RER stop. The building doesn't have an elevator so please note that you will have to carry your luggage up the stairs. The apartment was able to fit 4 adults and 2 children. The sofa beds are comfortable. Showers and baths work well. Kitchen is very roomy well-stocked and fully functional appliances. The air conditioning was limited to one room. We had temperatures above 90 F and it struggled to keep the room cool. Once the heat broke the apartment is very comfortable with a nice cross breeze. 
Take caution at the Chatelet train stop and trains pickpocketing is high."
15545961,226710768,2018-01-12,33637839,Tao,Eric很热心告诉我们怎么从机场过来给我们介绍了公寓及周边情况有问题及时回应｡公寓交通便利走路几分钟到地铁站周围很容易找到餐厅及超市｡公寓的面积还算宽敞相对于住房紧张的小巴黎来说但是设施用品有点旧有一点小不满意的地方是洗澡间没有门还在床旁边｡
3205365,42192190,2015-08-11,36551200,Gretchen,"Marion was very friendly and prompt. Her apartment is lovely and and we really enjoyed our stay. The neighborhood is very convenient to both train stations and metro lines so getting around is very easy. We slept very well and had plenty of space for four. The neighborhood is very interesting and we enjoyed the atmosphere.

8313266,316927058,2018-09-01,40947119,Dallas,Jean-Pierre was a gracious host and met us outside the apartment when we arrived. The apartment was clean and centrally located in a great neighborhood in Paris. Would stay here again.
28912491,544917974,2019-10-11,77725851,Tris,Staying at Ulrich’s flat is like staying the weekend at your cousins dorm in New York City.  Perfect location and right in the middle of everything but also super tiny and cluttered.  Getting in and out of the flat was like trying to get in and out of Fort Knox. Two coded doors to get through and then two keyed doors so it feels really safe it’s quiet and it’s close to so many things including the metro about 3 minutes away. There is a grocery store down the road and restaurants.  Lots of linens and towels no tv but if you are in Paris you probably are not wanting to watch tv. I probably would not stay here again because I like hotels when I stay in Europe but this place is a really good price for what you get and the location. Also Ulrich was extremely responsive and always replied back quickly with any questions that we had. When we left we took an uber from the flat to CDG airport and it was only 41€.

6230859,214544395,2017-11-26,4715682,Sandra,We enjoyed our stay in Le Marais area the apartment is well located for both the metro and the local attractions. Juliette kindly allowed us an extended check out which we greatly appreciated.
1008307,481240185,2019-07-04,2549990,Tara,We really enjoyed our stay in this flat. Apartment is big by Paris standards and has everything you need for a comfortable stay (even a dryer which is unusual). Location excellent great views. We had no trouble sleeping -- it's pretty quiet (when windows are shut) and we even managed to cope with a freak June heat wave. (AC was not available but there was a good fan.) Note that the apartment is actually lived in by owners (not manufactured for Instagram) so expect some quirks. Lots of light -- in fact the bedroom gets very bright very early in the morning in summer so consider bringing sleep masks.
23178617,527952176,2019-09-12,275594224,Nicole,This flat is pretty small.  The pictures make it seem larger than in it is as they have multiple flats pictured in the one listing.  It was mostly clean some dishes were dirty but left in the cabinet.  The beds were comfy and having a/c was a plus as it was warm when we stayed there.  Communication and check in/check out were subpar.  The location was right next to a metro station grocery stores and restaurants.  Not sure I'd stay here again based on my experience.
407502,1330438,2012-05-22,2247816,Hanna,Ken's apartment has everything you need for a short trip in Paris and is a great way to live cheap and central! Ken is very nice and helpful he gave us good tips and a map and had everything prepared for his guests. The apartment is very small and needs some renovation but for a weekend for two ideal. It is so central that you can reach many tourist attractions and the train station on foot but also a red-light district is next door. This is avoided easily by the inputs of two streets and a little further you get very nice bars cafe and restaurants...

We travelled during one of the hottest weekends of the French summer and found that the apartment was very hot during the night - but I imagine this would only be an issue when it is >30 degrees. 
Otherwise a great stay in Paris!"

Le quartier est très sympa on trouve plein de restos et de traiteurs de bonne qualité à proximité en particulier rue Montorgueil. On a pu faire plein de visites à pied à partir de l'appartement: le Louvres Notre dame le Marais sont à 1/4 d'heure à pied. Très bon rapport qualité prix pour cet appartement.
Nous reviendrons avec plaisir."
6175543,93911686,2016-08-14,77602792,Denny,I really enjoyed my stay in Sabrina's apartment. She was very cheerful and helpful before and after the stay. Gaurav is living somewhere else but visits and is also a really helpful guy; printed out my train ticket at his work. Sabrina recommended apps to download. Had wi-fi. Room was spacious with wardrobe. The only thing that bothered me was the creaky wooden floors but that's something you can't easily fix. Overall good experience!

8987499,122384766,2016-12-23,48701711,Amy,"Seriously go for this place. I've tried numerous airbnb places and I rarely do private rooms but this one was just so amazing!!!!!! It's so warm cozy clean and the bed is very comfortable. There is everything you ned. 

This is not a private room in a regular family house. It's an isolated room in an office. Since people are only in the office from 9-5 ish and you're most likely out during this time traveling in the city the whole place becomes yours! Although I've never really stayed or went inside the office (the room was too cozy and warm) it's great for people who want a both private room and a nice coach to relax at night. 

But the best thing about this place is the rue des martys street. No shame I loved this place so much that I booked my extended stay in Paris near rue des martys. There are so many cute shops groceries restaurants and bakeries... It's one of my absolute favorite street in Paris. You will never regret! It's so easy to walk to everywhere. You can save a lot of money on Uber taxi or train! 

One thing that was uncomfortable is that the room is tiny. It's hard to open two big luggages in the room but I've expected this so this was not a big issue for me. It may be for others.. 

Other than this everything was perfect. Benenice even provided me a charger for my phone which was a life saver for me... !! "

14400284,116506950,2016-12-01,98152872,Doris,The apartment was small but cozy for our family of 2A and 3 teenagers. WIFI connection was good. There was little space for us to move around in the living room. The small kitchen is basic enough for preparation of simple meals but the utensils are not adequate. There were no bowls and ladles etc. Despite these the space is still better than that of a hotel room and we spent most of our time outside. The only toilet with shower is small and there is a problem with the drainage. Water may overflow from shower area during our shower. I did not inform the host about this as we tried to control the waterflow from our shower. The location is convenient. The apartment is near to Strasbourg Saint Denis metro station and a supermarket is right outside the exit of the metro.

Lolotte  has an amazing studio type apartment in the heart of the Marais. The location is with in a minutes walk up to metro stations as well as multiple sites such as Notre Dame and Saint Chapelle. You will find yourself also in a wonderful neighborhood atmosphere. 
The location is also very safe and secure.
It is quite unique in its structure and has two comfortable beds as well as a very clean and organize kitchen and a wonderful bathroom with a great standup shower.
The little details are also a marvelous. 
There is a well equipped kitchen  as well as a very clean the bathroom with a stand up shower. There is a washer and dryer which is a great bonus.
Lolotte  also communicates immediately via email or text if you have questions.
This is the perfect place to stay for 1 to 2 people when in Paris.
Cannot recommend more highly"
26114794,335834111,2018-10-13,67444855,Andrew,Matthieu was a good host and when there was a problem he dealt with it very quickly.  The flat is newly renovated and is spotlessly clean.  Extremely lively location but nice and quiet inside the flat.  Perfect for our needs.

2477302,11967977,2014-04-20,12459386,Rossana,"Nuestra estadía en Paris fue impecable. Si bien nuestro anfitrión Antonio estaba de viaje y no pudimos verlo él tuvo la atención y preocupación de ayudarnos y allanar todas nuestras consultas. Nos recibió su amiga Imelda que hasta se ofreció a irnos a buscar al metro y que fue un gusto haberla conocido nos entregó su departamento nos dio las indicaciones y consejos necesarios. El departamento es muy cómodo fuimos dos matrimonios y en cuánto a dimensiones estuvo perfecto. Nos sentimos como en nuestra casa. Agradecemos la confianza que depositó Antonio en nosotros que no nos conocía y dejó su casa entera a nuestra disposición además de la atención de recibirnos con una botella de champan para festejar. En cuánto a la ubicación no hemos tenido ningún tipo de inconveniente nos manejamos con el metro cuando salíamos y a la vuelta en taxi ya que volvíamos tarde y el costo de cuatro personas no justificaba utilizar el metro. La zona del departamento es linda tranquila y con comercios muy cerca.
Fue un gusto tratar con Antonio e Imelda si volvieramos a Paris y Antonio continúa con este servicio volveríamos a utilizar su departamento.
Fue todo un placer!"
8955630,58343911,2016-01-02,25632303,Daphne,"I would really recommend the apartment of Françoise. The interior is spacious light and nicely decorated. Furthermore since the apartment is not located on the street side of the building it was very quiet.

The apartment was very clean and everything worked well (kitchen bathroom). It is located near a beautiful park. It is a 10-15 minute walk to the metro station (Porte d'Orléans or Denfert-Rochereau). There is also a Vélib-station (bike-renting system) within a 2 minute walk.

The contact with Françoise was good. She sent all the information before our arrival and responded quickly to any of my messages."

9224515,191676594,2017-09-08,5565850,Catrese,Best location in Paris. The apartment is quite modern and lovely. Minutes from Haussmann and Opera. I will definitely stay again.
591988,288122680,2018-07-09,71481710,Austin,Very spacious eclectic bright and walkable home base for our time in Paris. Great views of the city and the Eiffel Tower. Benjamin’s local food suggestions were wonderful.
11791883,93230037,2016-08-12,89062313,Andrew,"Anna’s apartment is perfect and we enjoyed our staying there.
Location is fantastic. We could go to main tourist attractions on foot. We did not wait or spend our time or money for the train or bus.
And It is very safe. As Anna wrote there were many police officers and soldiers around the apartment. It was very bright in the street at night. We did not worry about pickpockets or crazy people.
And the Metro Madeleine is very near and we could come to the apartment very easily. When we went to the Charles de Gaulle Airport the Roissy bus in front of Opera brought us to the airport very comfortably.
Apartment is also  perfect. It was very clean and there were plenty of towels and a fan others. We were 3 persons and it was comfortable to stay even though it was thought to be small. I think it is quite good and big for 2 persons.
Finally Anna is very kind. Whenever I contacted Anna she answered kindly and quickly.
I and my friends will come back to this apartment again."
22348701,317448288,2018-09-02,1242548,Aonghus,"May’s apartment was a perfect example of the Parisian experience. The building is a classic with wooden floors twisting staircases and gently angled walls under the eaves. And surprisingly spacious for a Parisian apartment. 


Despite being in the heart of the city it was incredibly quiet guaranteeing a restful night.


You access both the apartment and the key safe for the front door using a series of codes (again typically Parisian) which not only guarantees security but also means you don't need to worry about being late to rendezvous with the host if your flight/transport is delayed. Just arrive when you arrive and use the  code to release the key from the mini safe.


Last but not least May’s apartment is right in the heart of the city within easy walking distance of many of the main attractions. And with a metro station on the corner and the Chatelet / Les Halles metro hub no more than ten minutes walk away the rest of the city is easily accessed."
17168979,141690232,2017-04-04,63660924,Ahmed Ammar,"The place was nice and clean. Communicating Nathan was super easy and he responds really fast. 
I'd also like to mention that he was so kind that he took time out of his schedule to print us something we needed. Id definitely recommend Nathan's place to anyone who wishes to explore Paris. It does even have metro stations nearby (~5min walk)! Awesome place."
11856309,280023810,2018-06-22,25067225,Alejo,Posizione ottima! Vicino al pompideu e a Notre-Dame! Grazioso studio molto accogliente e ricercato per una esperienza da vero parigino! Nonostante ci siano stati dei piccoli problemi che a mio parere dovevano essere già sistemati prima ancora di mettere disponibile l’alloggio sono stati molto presenti e hanno sistemato tutto. 
19956081,313917896,2018-08-26,191922756,Davinia,El apartamento de Prune es excelente y acogedor. Además estaba muy limpio y la decoración nos encantó. Había todo lo necesario en cocina y cuarto de baño. La cama muy cómoda. Muy bien comunicado con el centro de la ciudad. Una estancia perfecta :)

9164960,120420247,2016-12-10,1257485,Andreas,"Ein sehr schönes Appartement im zweiten Hinterhof eines Hauses gelegen dass sehr typisch für das Marais ist. Wunderbare Strasse großartige Location - 3 Minuten zur Métro 2 Minuten zum Place des Vosges 5 Minuten zur Rue des Rosiers. Extrem ruhig (die kleine Strasse hinter dem Haus ist eine Sackgasse) und sehr charmant und perfekt geeignet für einen Aufenthalt der eine Mischung aus Urlaub und Arbeit war. Thibauts Vater ist extra angereist um das Appartement vor 12 Uhr zu übergeben Thibaut selbst war immer in Kontakt und hat liebenswürdigerweise eine Flasche Sekt im Kühlschrank deponiert. Ein sehr schöner Ort. Komme jederzeit gerne wieder!

We weren't sure how we would get to his place so he gave us all kinds of directions/options possible. Also loved that he's very upfront with his conditions. The room was exactly what it was said to be in description. Everything was  comfortable and cozy. Merci beaucoup for having us Olivier!

She also checks in every other day to make sure everything is going well that you are enjoying your time and that you don’t need anything. It was a really great experience all in all — thanks Ranya!! ❤️

The space is great for one person; it’s quite small but suitable for a solo traveler. Great location and it is also right by a metro station and bus stop which is super super convenient. Loved everything!!"
23619148,311816938,2018-08-22,34878319,Jae,A lovely little apartment on the Paris/Montrouge border. A lot of thought has gone into a new interior with Yasmine's choices in color and design. The two kitties are super sweet and a plus if you are a cat/animal person. Yasmine also had lots of great recommendations for places to visit based on my individuals interests and gift suggestions.
263389,28511751,2015-03-25,6515936,Daniel,J'ai passé un très agréable séjour dans ce beau studio du 3e arrondissement très bien situé et bien équipé. Logement bien confortable et quartier sympa.

13426186,236382873,2018-02-19,1570357,Marisa,Stunning and functional! This apartment is both gorgeous and comfortable - we loved having large living spaces to gather together and private areas. Great location quiet and the artwork and decor makes you consider skipping the museums in favor of staying in with wine and cheese.
8185418,528006492,2019-09-12,285179862,Helen,"집이 예상보다 훨씬 넓고 깔끔해서 놀랬고
지하철역에서도 정말 가깝고 주변환경도 까페와 상점도 많고 밤늦게까지 사람이 많이 다녀서 너무 좋았습니다!
창문에서 고개를 내밀면 에펠탑이 정말 잘 보였던점도 너무 맘에 들었습니다!!
파리에서 여러 아파트에 머물러봤지만 정말 모든면에서 최고의 숙소였습니다. 다시 파리를 방문한다면 또 머물고싶습니다!"

461860,8309023,2013-10-25,7876687,Andrea,"El apartamento es pequeño con una buena ventana en la sala de estar. Nosotros eramos 4 adultos y es bastante pequeño para ese número. Si bien es interior entra mucha luz y es super silencioso. La zona es alucinante bien diferente y muy movida. Hay un montón de comercios alrededor y la línea 2 del metro te deja solo a 2 cuadras lo que lo hace muy accesible. 
Las instrucciones que Beonite nos dio fueron exactas y no hubo forma de perdernos. Lo único que no pudimos hacer fue cocinar ya que no hay ollas en la casa ni horno pero estando de vacaciones nada es un problema. "
1335769,323772670,2018-09-16,73561340,Emily,Es una recámara grande. El lugar está muy limpio y nos dió toallas jabón y shampoo que nos ayudó mucho. La ubicación es buena ya que tiene una estación de metro muy cerca pero caminando son cómo 25 minutos de los lugares turísticos. En la cama caben 2 personas. Muy recomendable
24494555,486093991,2019-07-12,69410422,Patricia,Alojamiento inmejorable tamaño pequeño como todos en Paris pero suficiente para pasar una buena estancia en la ciudad de las luces. En el barrio del Montmartre y a solo 100 metros de la estación de Lamarck. Muy limpio y cómodo. Juliette es una anfitriona excelente y nos dió muy buenas recomendaciones locales. Calidad - precio excelente.
16437996,330927676,2018-10-01,153012521,Charles,Amazing location for price. Very well presented with everything you need. Easy check in and great communication. Perfect place if need to be based in centre of Paris
21640042,289030919,2018-07-11,93354487,Tor,"Fin leilighet med veldig god beliggenhet i sentrum av Paris. Veldig praktisk med supermarked i 1 etasje mange resatauranter å velge mellom nede på gaten. Gangavstand (2-3 minutter) til Metro Montmartre Sacre Ceur og Moulin Rouge. Kort vei til  attraksjoner som Eiffel tårnet båttur på Seinen og Louvre med Metro. Vi savnet aircondition på de varmeste dagene. Ellers var leiligheten meget godt utstyrt.
Takk for et koselig opphold. 

Hilsen Aud Marie & Tor Bergen - Norway."

Jules is a nice guy - friendly very communicative and helpful. He waited for us with keys upon our arrival and showed us the neighborhood. 
The location is perfect just few minutes walk from Republique station from where you can get by metro basically everywhere in Paris within 20mins.
The place itself is small nothing fancy or modern but gives you the privacy and you have everything you need. So if you want good value for money then Jules place is definitely the one you are looking for. It met our requirements. FULLY RECOMMENDED! "
31857267,443073577,2019-04-25,33151095,Tiff,We loved staying at Anne-Catherine’s apartment! It is charming very clean stylish open bright and airy. Plus stocked with everything you need to be comfortable and happy in Paris (even butter)! Very convenient if you have a car as there is secure parking available. And a small kitchenette & washer for longer stays. The bed was very comfy too! We were able to Uber all over for between $5 -$15 euros. Ann-Catherine is a very accommodating friendly and helpful host! She was kind enough to provide lots of local suggestions and willing to help with anything she could. Highly recommended to all!
883440,81696084,2016-06-24,70580102,Lizzie,We arrived very late and David was still very nice and welcoming. He was very helpful in showing us around by giving us recommendations on where to eat and explaining how to get around Paris. As for the apartment itself it was just like in the pictures and in my opinion even better! The location was also perfect! Very central and in a nice area. Would definitely stay here again and I recommend this place to others as well!
17631738,282806475,2018-06-28,1556168,Alice,Probably my favourite place I’ve ever stayed in Paris. Quiet at night but still close to the metro a grocery store a few great restaurants but a few blocks walk in any direction led to lots more great restaurants a canal in one direction a park in another. Loved the brightness of the apartment the water pressure and a good comfy couch to collapse on after a long day walking. Hoping it’s free when I’m back in town next.

Deux points qui ne nous ont pas posé de problèmes : la salle de bain est dans une chambre et l'ascenseur est très petit (maxi 2 personnes). Nous recommandons vivement cet appartement."

4380522,30014493,2015-04-16,9701430,Rebecca,Jeanne Valerie met us with a friendly welcome and showed us round her lovely artistic apartment. The apartment feels much bigger than it appears in the site photos as it has lots of different spaces in it there are 2 separate sleeping areas which suited us well. The tiny lift up to the 6th floor is an experience not to be missed (especially after a long day's sight seeing!)We stayed 4 days and spent our time visiting galleries shops gardens and just enjoying the sites and sounds of Paris. The apartment is ideally situated for many of the main tourist attractions which can mostly be reached by walking or on the metro. Jeanne Valerie very kindly allowed us to leave our bags at the apartment until we were ready to leave in the evening on our last day. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Paris.  
4962119,161207522,2017-06-17,128456078,Isabella,Xavier was an excellent host . His place is very nice and comfortable. Excellent location. Every amenity included. Fun area for families and couples alike. Very centric. Metro is just a 5 minute walk. Area is full of cafes and restaurants . Too bad we were there only one night. There is no lift for the apartment but we were fine with it since it was just a few steps up the stairs. Definitely would stay here again.   
8346982,52105222,2015-10-26,27910863,Frank,"Sophie is the most lovely accommodating and welcoming host. Thank you for everything! 

I could NOT recommend this apartment highly enough. Right in the centre of the most glorious area of Paris so close to everything and with beautiful parks restaurants cafes streets and cultural gems to stroll around till your hearts content! 

I will be suggesting this place to everyone from now on. It's perfect."
23777389,458633466,2019-05-26,114316596,Morten,Very good apartment in a decent location. In particular the host was of great help during the entire process. Can definitely recommend.
1900636,56120455,2015-12-09,46893159,Hector,Our experience was great. The place was perfect. Clean cozy and ideally located in a non tourist area just like we wanted. Hilal was great. He took us for a walk around the neighborhood to show us what was there plus he gave us detailed explanation in a map to get around the city. Great host!
1577747,121011935,2016-12-13,11497873,Kirk,"This was my second time in Paris and my second time staying in Le Marais. By far my favorite neighborhood in Paris. My wife and I stayed here for the first part of our European honeymoon. It was cozy for 2 of us you would have to be a very close group to fit 4. We walked 10 miles a day and found the location to be excellent for getting around. 

Medhi was very responsive to everything. We were able to check in early which was amazing after a long flight over. 

The wifi was pretty solid. We both work from our computers so wifi is a bit of an obsession. This network did the job. 

The bathtub is more of a sit down shower. The shower head was a wand and after soaking the floor our first go we decided to just sit down and take bath showers :) I'm sure there was a simple technique that we missed the boat on. 

We were able to do a small load of laundry on our last day. You have to air dry though and I spent a good 20 minutes on (Hidden by Airbnb) trying to find a manual to use the European wash. But it worked. And our underwear was clean for Amsterdam. 

Overall great experience with a very friendly host. Worth the money for sure. "
14971673,544833840,2019-10-11,3057161,Luca,This beautiful apartment is in a wonderful location making it easy to explore the city like a local. Graham was warm and welcoming. He is english speaking to break up the french for those who are not fluent. Don’t forget to  make use of the bath during your stay Highly recommended.
7291314,171987178,2017-07-19,37091189,Heather,Lovely cozy and central to a great neighborhood! Apartment is small but has everything you need! Judi was very responsive and super helpful! 
7609251,133545854,2017-02-23,14725712,Rumi-Anna,Fantastic  location and great host!  But if you are a couple staying more then two days the room is way too small and there is no space for luggage or clothes being taken out of the suitcases. A hanger on the wall would have helped. It's great for a single person though. The cold shower head needs fixing - it's not working at all. 
588211,8250106,2013-10-22,2321986,Chloe,J'ai passé un weekend dans l'appartement d'Aurélia avec des amis australiens qui découvraient Paris. Il est parfaitement situé pour accéder aux sites touristiques et se promener dans le quartier du Marais. L'appartement était très propre lorsque nous sommes arrivés. C'est parfait pour 2... si vous êtes 3 il faut être conscient que l'un des guests doit dormir dans le salon et passer par la chambre pour l'accès à la salle de bains et aux toilettes (mais ça convient parfaitement pour un weekend touristique). En bref: je recommande !
31648475,411407104,2019-02-12,121859278,Pierre,Super quartier appartement très propre.
35474663,543126789,2019-10-07,33701745,Sophia,Justine's place is small but has everything you need. It's cute very conveniently located to the train and it was very helpful for us to have some basics available like coffee water soap. The neighborhood also has amazing food (turkish french bars) very nearby!

11780110,133531001,2017-02-23,1484019,Elizabeth,Sasha's flat is a true hidden gem! The photos don't do the amount of space in the flat complete justice and it was a pleasant surprise to discover how much space is in the flat. The terrace is AMAZING and perfect for morning breakfast or afternoon coffee. The living room is large and the dining room area was also very spacious. Both bedrooms were very large and the space definitely could fit 2 couples extremely comfortably. Thanks for an amazing stay Sasha!
374015,35837246,2015-06-22,31397677,Monika,"Communication with Vincent was very good. He replied to the messages fast polite & efficiently.
The studio itself was OK but it needs a good TLC or rewamp. 
Also place was not very clean. The bathroom had long black hair around. The bedding on the sofa downstairs was not fresh either with hair on it. 
We also had only 2 big towels & it was 3 of us.
There was good selection of cutlery pans glasses if you wish to cook. 
Overall it is OK to stay at Vincent for a very short visit as the flat is quite noisy from outside as it is on the ground floor."
16593683,408713821,2019-02-05,9718493,Claudia,Appartemento carino e spazioso rispetto alla media di Parigi. La zona interessante con un po' di attenzione la sera attorno al canale. L'host mette a disposizione tutto ma consiglio di portrasi un asciugamano da doccia.

21236783,509182241,2019-08-14,47140543,Julian,This place is great! Excellent location near the Seine and the neighborhood surrounding the unit is beautiful. The unit is a little small but it’s Paris so you shouldn’t be spending too much time in your room anyway. There was coffee and some dishes which were very helpful in the morning. Paul is a great host and very responsive one of the best I’ve ever stayed with. If you’re looking for a place to lay your head in the heart of the city look no further.
15449787,115908558,2016-11-27,44199621,Gilles,L'appartement de Sarah idéalement situé près de Simplon offre une magnifique vue sur Montmartre et sa basilique. Le quartier est vivant animé et les gens y sont courtois et adorables. L'appartement de Sarah est décoré avec goût possède une cheminée qui amène encore plus de charme au lieu et une literie très confortable. Je recommande sans hésiter :)

Je le recommande!"

1522266,213816031,2017-11-23,147602666,Mohammed,We really enjoyed the place it was very clean and cosy. It was a bit cold at night but we didn’t know about the programmable AC system so that’s fine. I would go there every time I’m in Paris. Lila was great to talk to and she was very helpful and responsive.

9035974,248338527,2018-03-31,36968146,Александр,"Our stay at this appartment was beautiful. 

The location of appartment is very good: 100 m to ""La muette"" metro station very close (as for me) to Eiffel tower Trocadero and many other ""must see"" places of this district. A lot of shops are located near the house. Grocery store - in 10 meters ;) A lot of cafes/restaurants you can find in 3 minutes walking range.

Fantastic views of Paris directly from windows of the flat. You can ever see the Eiffel tower from kitchen window and from one terrace!

Fully equipped kitchen even with dishwashing machine! Very clean bathroom (complete set of towels included).

This flat also equipped with TV iron hairdryer washing machine.

I will recommend this appartment to all my friends and will stay again here during my next Paris trips."
2460651,101987579,2016-09-16,807369,Jacob,Roni's apartment was fantastic. Very spacious and fully equipped. The location is also very nice. It is in a charming local part of Paris with hardly any tourists but is still close enough to all the tourist spots. Although we did not meet Roni we communicated frequently by email and she organized for a friend to welcome us. We also appreciate all the excellent local recommendations provided by Roni and her friends. Highly recommended. 
1180022,128048678,2017-01-22,52559229,Hakan,We felt very comfortable in Claudias Apartment. The Apartment is located in a small street so it is very quiet that you can sleep very well. You can find everything what you need in Claudias apartment. Thank you Claudia

21615474,536797936,2019-09-27,286219677,Noel,Lovely apartment and greatly located. It's in between 2 metro stations (Austerlitz and saint Marcel) and 3 mins walk to each one. Restaurants and shops are just steps away. Kitchen was equipped everything you'd need for a basic meal. It's an one bedroom apartment but there's not much seperation between the bedroom and the living. It works for a couple or very small family with young children. Having a balcony is great as well. The building and the neighborhood felt safe. We came home late a few nights and didn't feel uncomfortable. The washroom set up is interesting but then I realized it's very common in Paris. Marine has an amazing collection of books. If you love to read and can read French you could stay in all day!!!!
19981325,240122301,2018-03-04,11716158,Marc,Nous avons particulièrement apprécié l'emplacement de ce joli petit appartement dans un quartier vivant à proximité mais très calme sur place.
5380414,131451627,2017-02-12,63190059,Irene,"Piso ideal para parejas o para ir con una amiga/o. La cama es comodísima y muy amplia. La cocina es suficiente para cocinar cosas simples y el casero te proporciona lo básico para poder hacerlo. La bañera es grande para ser Paris. Todo muy limpio. El casero super simpático y no fue estricto con las horas de llegada y de salida además de aconsejarnos sitios y proporcionarnos contacto. El piso muy cerca del metro bus supermercado a cinco minutos de la Torre Eiffle tranquilo y accesible.
Lo mejor la localización del piso y la cama. Lo peor la decoración. Repetiremos seguro."
30394569,546814835,2019-10-14,60373896,Christopher,We experienced a fantastic time in Paris which was made all the more enjoyable knowing that we had the cosy apartment to head back to at the end of a long day sightseeing. The check-in was made easy & friendly with instructions clear to understand. The location is perfect for being as central as possible to all the major attractions. Thanks once again for everything.

462307,493230764,2019-07-22,25314577,Ryan,Great apartment in an excellent location. It’s more suitable for 2 to 3 people than our four particularly with two small kids but we got through fine. It is a typical Paris apartment in that it can get hot on summer nights.  The hosts’ meet and greet at checkin time and allowance of a late checkout was great. Overall this is a highly recommended place to stay.
3598207,134411750,2017-02-27,17592133,Giacomo,Great. The flat is close to the back part of Montmartre full of restaurants and beautiful spots and the price is very reasonable compared to the Hotels you can find.

C'est un petit apartment agréable et intime sans vis-à-vis et avec une vue sur les toits que nous avons adoré. Le quartier est vraiment très calme (pour les gens qui ont le sommeil léger c'est le top). 

Le lit est ferme et propre comme on aime. La salle de bains a une grande baignoire et les toilettes sont dans une autre pièce complètement séparé. La cuisine est petite mais bien équipée et propre. Ce sont pleins de petits détails qui font de cet endroit un vrai plaisir à vivre. 

Merci Noémie

3304443,230493715,2018-01-28,104391167,Fake,This is a great flat and location in the centre of Paris.   We had no problem finding the place and obtaining the keys for access was by another but all went really well together with good local knowledge.  Whilst we were very happy our only complaint was the noise from other residence nothing the host can do really much about other than suggest ear plugs at the weekend.  The location far outweighed being woken up! thank you for offering a great apartment

The location is very central with very easy access to the Paris Metro and RER. The apartment is clean the bed very comfortable and I found very easy to communicate with Cedric to organize my visit. He wasn't in the apartment while I was there but he coordinated with his flatmate Fagner on how to welcome me in their home. Fagner was very kind: he was always available for helping and gave me full access to all the spaces in the apartment. Wifi internet  doesn't work in the bedroom but the signal is very strong in the living room. The connection is extremely fast.

Would definitely come back again"

1300474,16614766,2014-07-30,13420631,Lynnette,"We loved staying at Adeline's place. It looked exactly like the pictures and is very cute. There was 1 double bed and the sofa converted into a single bed as well. It was extremely clean and neat. It was great to have access to a washing machine as well. The location is great within walking distance to major sites shopping and Montmartre. The metro Château d'eau is a 2 min walk away.  There are tonnes of restaurants around and grocery stores as well. We felt very safe since the building had two entrances both with codes to get in and then there is the key to get into the actual apartment. 

We never actually met Adeline but she was very good at answering all our questions and giving us information with transport to and from the airport. We had some issues connecting our phones to the wifi and Adeline took time to look into the problem and also offered us an alternate network to connect to in the meantime. 

Due to our travels prior to Paris we arrived late to pick up the key and Adeline was very accommodating at making sure we received it. 

Overall our stay was very good and we would definitely recommend staying at Adeline's place."

7078780,304387217,2018-08-09,57374929,Guifang,It was early Sunday morning when I firstly landed Paris with my daughter  with mixed feeling and expectation due to the message I had learned about the city. I remember Edith asked very on time how everything was going. From then on even though Edith was not at home she was helpful warm providing any information needed. She did help us feel home and live like a local.Edith’s home is very artistic clean sitting in a safe friendly convenient neighborhood with a lovely kitchen. There’s a supermarket just downstairs on the left several groceries to the right . You can go to anywhere you want from the metro stop near home(5 minutes away home) When we left my 11-year     daughter said she wished she could stay one more month here in Edith’ s home. We left Paris with wonderful memory to this metropolis. It has become  a wonderful trip because of Edith. We surely want to come back to Edith’s home next time when we visit Paris.

11341243,455845680,2019-05-20,198086151,Holden,This space is MUCH smaller than it appears in photos. There is also no wifi and poor cell service if you happen to have a phone plan. The location is great but we had a particularly difficult time checking in to our room. When we arrived the key was not where it was supposed to be and we had to wait for about an hour for someone to be sent over to unlock it. When the door opened the guests who were staying there before us still had bags trash and food waste scattered around the room and we had to leave our bags hidden under the futon to ensure their safety as we were already late for our scheduled time at the Louvre. When we came back the place had been cleaned and looked a lot better and our stuff was thankfully all there but there was still dirt in the shower that was off-putting. Last the safety hazards: the mirror behind the bed is broken and the missing shard is in one of the drawers and the smoke detector was also out of use. The value and amenities (washer drying rack etc.) are great but our experience left a lot to be desired.
9018159,401882659,2019-01-16,127078532,Dan,Great place. Met all our expectations and beyond. Very clean. Very quiet place in a vibrant area. Stayed together with our daughter and we all enjoyed it very much. Location is perfect.
5452049,532670400,2019-09-20,131846391,Aleena,This was a wonderful location and Carole was so kind and welcoming. We had never been to Paris and arrived by train quite easily to her flat. She was very responsive to messages and even held our luggage for us the last day so we could explore more. The in unit laundry was very nice to have. Her unit is minutes from many great locations and felt very safe. Drinking wine on her patio was an amazing experience for our honeymoon and one not soon forgotten. Thank you!

7732027,80018923,2016-06-15,41153727,Shirley,Emmanuel's apartment is exactly as pictured: spacious organized and immaculate. It is located in a wonerderfully diverse neighborhood in the 19th very near the largest park in Paris. The bed---and linens--- were very comfortable and the window shades were totally adjustable to person preference. The building itself is very secure quiet and neat. It is located within one block of the Metro; very convenient. We were welcomed warmly in a timely manner upon our arrival from CDG given an instructional tour and presented our keys. Emmanuel checked in with us to be sure everything was going well and that we had no issues which he needed to address. (There were none!) We are very satisfied with all aspects of this listing and will be booking it again whenever possible. 
22318704,343094945,2018-10-30,43926931,Adina,"Marie was a great host really nice and helpful as she answered  to all of our questions. 
Even though really small the studio was cosy and stylish decorated perfect for a 2-3 night stay. It is located close to Montmartre. 
There was a small incident with the water tank though. We ran out of hot water and we had to finish showering with cold water. As writen in the studio instructions left by Marie the water tank needs about 15 minutes to refill and only lasts for a quick shower. But still. It was really cold in Paris and all we wanted was a hot shower to warm up ourselves.
Nevertheless Marie was helpful and tried to offer as many suggestions as she could.
Nice stay overall."

He was generous enough to allow us to drop our back off in the middle of him cleaning the apartment. It was exactly as described in the pictures and description. I would stay again in a heartbeat.

12284390,364736312,2018-12-31,106291088,Giuseppe,L’appartamento è piccolo ma confortevole in un quartiere tranquillo a 10 min a piedi dalla fermata del Bus e della Metro. A due passi c’è tutto quello che serve: supermercato fruttivendolo macelleria e vari bar e ristoranti. L’appartamento ha il bagno molto piccolo e con accesso da una delle due camere. Per il resto è dotato di tutto quello che serve considerato che quando non è affittato è abitato dalle due proprietarie e contiene quindi anche i loro effetti personali. È un’esperienza interessante perchè alla fine è come essere ospitati da amici. Noi eravamo in tre e ci siamo trovati molto bene. Perfettamente pulito e ordinato. Ci ritorneremmo sicuramente.
19711931,187083057,2017-08-26,3869093,Ranjan,Great location. Nice home. But noisy as the bedrooms are on the side of the Main Street. Gets  noisy in the mornings. Very Easy access to metro. Grocery. Restaurants. Good breakfast and coffee places
9752260,100185170,2016-09-07,37877611,Martyna,Fabrizio is exactly who you want to greet you when you arrive in a foreign country. He radiates friendliness and warmth and will go out of his way to be available for answering any questions. The apt is run as a true Airbnb place not a hotel. You really feel like your staying at someone's place and getting an authentic local experience. This is a perfect spot to tour Paris from. 
12240436,134106247,2017-02-26,20649841,Valeria,"We met both Elsa and her husband who are nice and attentive hosts. The short conversations we had with them were really pleasant. They were available when necessary communication was easy and effective when we had to get in touch with them. 
The studio was exactly as described. Although small (but we know it was that way) it is comfortable well equipped and with a fully working Wi-Fi (often necessary when travelling abroad)! I really liked the USB socket on the wall :) Well done! 
We really appreciated any kind of equipment especially the coffee machine and the basic stuff like coffee capsules and tea bags for our own use (if your journey lasts only a weekend you don't spend your time in searching for a supermarket).
The studio is very well connected by metro (more than one line stop nearby). Moreover if you want to walk around it is close to Canal St. Martin which was an unknown area for us and walking along the canal was a pleasant discovery.

530318,557967341,2019-11-02,146162410,Yess,La casa está muy cerca del metro y todos los lugares turísticos quedan cerca.   Es un departamento amplio ideal para 2 personas ya que solo cuenta con una recamaras y una sola cama. A la casa le hace falta mantenimiento como pintura lo que ocasiona que se vea sucia. El lavabo está tapado por lo que se le aviso al anfitrión pero nunca fue a arreglarlo.

With everything around and just a 30 min walk to the Louvre ( with lots of restaurants and shops along the way).  The windows allow the place to have lots of light so when is sunny you have a full look of what beautiful day it is.  Easy to find.
Also Julien left us a book in english with directions for everything. 
Me and my wife loved the apartment."
10557281,264100426,2018-05-13,28581474,Alexandra,Logement parfaitement situé pour le shopping et visite de Paris centre. En revanche très bruyant en raison de la situation au 1er étage et de la rue très passante.

11496031,252035022,2018-04-09,470371,Sarah,After so many years of paying a large amount of money for a teeny weeny Paris hotel room it was a bit weird to have all this space all to ourselves! Super clean and comfortable the only slight drawback is noise from the road which might bother you if you are a very light sleeper like me. But it dies down around midnight and the metal shutters make the room nice and dark. The location is great with a couple of really friendly and good restaurants a minute's walk away and a large Casino two minute's walk away. We had a great time thank you Penelope.

602484,528488099,2019-09-13,61574484,Carrie,"I'd give 10 stars if I could! If you're visiting Paris stay here!! Ariane's place is a true gem in a great location / neighborhood. The flat is comfortable cozy and well appointed. 

The kitchen has EVERYTHING you could want or need (quite roomy too!) if your stay is longer and you prefer to have some home-cooked meals now and then. 

But if not no worries because there are many restaurants on the street itself not to mention the expanded neighborhood. You'll want for nothing. 

Everything is sparkling clean and the wonderful french windows let in loads of natural light.

An eclectic and lively neighborhood (one of the best in Paris IMO) the Oberkampf area is full of restaurants cafes shops markets. The flat is close to at least two Metro stops.

Ariane is an exceptional host. She offered much helpful information about the flat itself and the area in general.  I enjoyed every moment here and will always remember this visit in Paris fondly!"

24407438,546899574,2019-10-14,98046976,Eleanor,JPs studio is exactly as described. Compact yet carefully designed to make the most of every nook and cranny. The kitchen has everything needed to fix up light meals and to store small amounts of perishables. A kettle would have been nice but there’s a microwave or pans for boiling water. There’s a Monoprix supermarket almost directly opposite the apartment building and a fantastic pâtisserie and boulangerie directly opposite too. The bed upstairs seemed too cramped and uncomfortable to me so like other reviewers have already suggested I highly recommend sleeping on the pull out couch. It was quite comfortable. The bathroom facilities were great with lots of hot water on demand.  The combined washer/dryer was handy to have although I couldn’t find an instruction manual so had to guess the most correct settings for the load. The apartment is in a great location with the Saint Paul Métro just a few minutes walk away or the bus stop even closer still. Response time to communication with either JP or one of his colleagues was always prompt and helpful. JPs studio felt safe and is situated in a secure building - an important consideration for a solo female traveller who is unfamiliar with the city. If you’re looking for somewhere close to all of the central Paris sites I’d highly recommend JPs studio apartment in Le Marais.

There are tons of great bakeries and foodie places scattered around! The communication from our hosts was wonderful and all of their recommendations were great! If you appreciate good coffee I would recommend La Cafeotheque delicious! Also the falafel place just next door was our first meal in Paris and was more than satisfying for food on the go and try crepes from the man on the corner literally a 1 minute walk away (go right when you come out of the appt). All in all the whole experience exceeded my expectations and we can't wait to visit again! Thank you once again for everything to our amazing hosts! P.S yes the apt is small but it's chic and typically Parisian and adds to the experience! Au revoir Paris until next time!

12371739,109772479,2016-10-23,91897265,Michelle,After arriving a little lost from Gare du Nord metro station I contacted Melanie and she immediately met up with me to guide me to her place. The apartment wasn't far but rather the street signs weren't as visible and I wasn't accustomed to this. She did an amazing job of making my arrival such a smooth transition and stayed in constant communication whenever I had questions. The place was very country chic and beautifully kept. The only caveat I have is the upstairs burlap carpeting in which I suggest you wear socks upstairs otherwise your feet will burn after a long day of walking. I would wholeheartedly rent this place out again when I come back. I felt like a true Parisian!  Thanks Melanie for a wonderful stay!

Thierry was fantastic with us and gave us all kinds of facilities to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The apartment is small but enough. This is as in the photos (duplex in a fourth floor). The situation is very good ( five minutes walking from the Hotel de Ville and very close to the Center Pompidou and Notre Dame). Just in the same street there is a supermarket with everything you need and in the corner there is a bakery where you can buy excellent bread and macarons.
The underground station is only five minutes walking.
The neighbourhood is very lively at weekends but you don't listen any noise from the apartment.
If I go to Paris again I will sure ask Thierry again to stay."

162163,186299148,2017-08-24,100877689,Max,"Gros soucis post location avec Justin 

L'ami pour qui j'ai loué le airbnb est parti avec  un peu de retard qu'il a régularisé en versant 20 euros à la dame qui s'occupait du ménage ce jour là.

Je me suis questionné par rapport à la légalité de la chose sur airbnb sachant que ce n'était même pas écrit dans l'annonce mais par correction il les a payé 

Par la suite j'ai reçu de nombreux sms me disant qu'en gros nous mentions que les 20 euros n'avaient pas été versés et qu'il fallait que je fasse un virement de 40 euros via airbnb pour dédommager l'hôte.

Je me questionne toujours sur la légalité des faits et je vais poser la question à airbnb 
Je ne louerai plus chez cet hôte et là dessus je pense que c'est réciproque.

En cas de litige le plus simple est de contacter airbnb directement plus que d'essayer de soutirer de l'argent par SMS.

À bon entendeur"

Giulia was a great host with warm welcoming taking care of details and eyc. Etna the cat gave a great atmosphere as well. View to Monmarte through window was really nice. I would really recommend Giulia's place where I felt like staying at friend's home rather than a stranger. Many thanks.

8644634,248712843,2018-04-01,52970392,Emma,Beautiful stylish and very comfortable apartment in interesting area of Paris. It was lovely for our children to have the use of beautiful children’s rooms it made them feel right at home. Wonderful local shops for fresh produce. Close to underground stations but tricky for parking but that’s city life for you! Anne-Sophie is a thoughtful host who left us some nice welcome gifts. Brilliant.

12821804,94980474,2016-08-17,8443430,Esther,"Meryl was really easy to communicate with which was a plus and the location was nice but this apartment is on the fourth floor with steep steps - so keep that in mind. 

Arriving to the apartment was EXTREMELY difficult. We told her that our arrival would be later in the night but our flight got delayed about 1.5 hours so we didn't end up arriving to the place until around midnight. When we spoke Meryl said her housemaid/neighbor would let us in but since she didn't speak any English I was told to message them in French on (Hidden by Airbnb)  since Meryl wasn't anywhere close to the apartment. 

I messaged the housemaid and didn't get a response in 10 minutes. Then I called on (Hidden by Airbnb) three/four times and still no one picked up. I didn't know what to do since the owner wasn't close at all and couldn't let us in. I finally had to call Meryl (paying international phone rates) so she could call her neighbor. She finally got a hold of them and they came. But just to get through the door we waited 30 minutes. 

Then when we got in the windows weren't completely shut so we had to open it a bit to close it. Doing so made a ton of smoke from the bars below come in and MOSQUITOES. From the three nights we stayed my husband got (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) bites and I got 5. Only a thick blanket was provided (and THIN pillows) during the hot August summer. I opted to just wear long pants and a thin sweatshirt so I was at a good temperature which is why I had less bug bites. 

The place didn't have much in terms of stock. Meryl only provided us one towel for two people. We were okay with it though so we didn't mention it to her. But then there was NO trash can provided even in the kitchen.  We found a trash bag lying around to use. Then the soap in one of the bathrooms was nonexistent and when I messaged Meryl about how there was no extra toilet paper she told me to go buy some. I have NEVER had any Airbnb not provide TOILET PAPER. And to top it off make me buy it. We ended up just getting some napkins from restaurants because we aren't going to carry around 6 rolls of toilet paper to the other cities we are visiting.

SO BAD. I DO NOT RECOMMEND STAYING HERE."
14269967,139724922,2017-03-26,53368548,Kelly,Great place has all the bells and whistles. We absolutely loved it. Owners have exquisite taste in art and interior design very hip yet classy. Balcony Fireplace and Turn tables really put the icing on the cake.

Un petit bémol à noter : l'appartement donne directement sur le boulevard qui est très bruyant il faut donc penser à emmener des bouchons d'oreilles pour passer une nuit calme si on a le sommeil léger."

Previous descriptions of the noise are accurate. If you really need quiet to get to sleep please keep in  mind that the square is active to 2AM. 

Highly recommended!  "
18944433,461165979,2019-05-31,107964709,Jenae,"We stayed for 1 week May 23rd to 31st. Jojo met us at the apartment promptly after a long trip from Sydney. Jojo herself was a breath of fresh air bubbly and friendly and making us feel welcome immediately (all this despite having just had a baby a few days prior). The apartment is amazing spotlessly clean and much larger than indicated in the photos. The bed is very comfortable and kitchen well equipped. The location is perfect 5 minutes walk to the Trocadero with beautiful views of the Eiffel Tower. The apartment is also an easy walk with suitcases from the Trocadero Metro and a number of supermarkets and restaurants within close vicinity. All in all a lovely apartment well priced with a lovely host. 
Thanks Jojo!"
11087370,481694354,2019-07-05,1104557,Jolyon,We absolutely loved staying here! This must be one of the city’s best streets - so lively and enjoyable - but the apartment’s private courtyard means that inside is a peaceful oasis. The best of both worlds! The hosts were so lovely and helpful and the apartment was very well appointed and super clean. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to everyone! Thank you

The apartment was very clean. The building was quiet and very relaxing. The lift was nice so we did not have to carry our bags up or down the flight of stairs.

Best place we've ever stayed in Paris. Jay is a thoughtful host and everything was as described. We'll definitely stay here again when our travels bring us back.
22543032,327675865,2018-09-24,125661126,Cedric,"Petits appartement (style Parisien) au septième étage mais très bien situé. 

L’appartement se trouve dans une rue avec beaucoup de petits restos et commerces mais n’a aucuns soucis de bruit vu qu’il ne donne pas côté rue. A moins de dix minutes du métro et RER mais aussi très centrale donc nous avons pu visiter énormément de la ville simplement à pied. 
Malgré que nous n’avons pas rencontré Sandra en personne elle a été très réactive par message.

A conseiller aux personnes qui ne s’attendent pas au grand luxe mais qui veulent être bien situé avec le confort de base nécessaire."
14034318,91647876,2016-08-06,20739852,Jenn,This was the worst experience EVER! I arrived in Paris with my spouse and three small children with absolutely no response from Thomas. We texted and called him repeatedly until we hit about 11pm and decided we would have to find somewhere else to stay (which is really stressful with small children who are tired). We had to drag our luggage all around the city while waiting to hear from him and...nothing! I don't know if this is a scheme or what but beware of booking with this host. WE STILL HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM HIM!
33612284,450726052,2019-05-10,129952364,Bridget,Yéléna was a lovely host very quick to respond and easily accommodating. Her flat is in a fantastic location with a Métro super close. The space is cozy and perfect for a place to hang your head (and luggage). I would return if visiting Paris again.
38784098,543098795,2019-10-07,157757430,Yen,Fantastic location for price close to lots of things and I felt safe there as a solo traveler. The bed is actually a futon. The place is super tiny and has poor lighting.  The bathroom is Itty bitty and the whole place smelled old. I think the bathroom should've been doused in bleach because there werw many areas of mold and mildew. The shower curtain had a hole in it and it wouldn't cost the host very much to replace something like that!
1745978,12575940,2014-05-05,14541944,Fontaine,"Très bonne communication avec Christian le propriétaire. La maison est située dans  un environnement très calme.

Very kind and quick to respond to all of my questions.  The flat was comfortable and the location was perfect.  Buttes Chaumont was a charming neighborhood with easy access to the rest of the city by subway and the flat was just a short walk to the nearest subway stop.  Overall I had a fantastic trip and would definitely stay again if I'm ever back in Paris.

7918492,76554922,2016-05-28,23988222,Sophie,The best thing about this apartment is the location. It's a beautiful place to stay close to a metro and it feels like you're really in Paris not just amongst other tourists- whilst still being near to the central attractions Eiffel Tower etc. Anton was easy to communicate with. The apartment can be noisy in the mornings as near a road but nothing earplugs couldn't fix.  Thankyou Anton!

11896814,320106448,2018-09-08,16501764,Gina,In the heart of bustling Bastille neighborhood this flat is accessible to everything. It was very clean and my boyfriend and I were quite comfortable there. The wi-fi and cable were appreciated comforts that made it feel more homey. I used the iron and hair blow dryer which we nice to have as well. A great place to rest your head after a long day of sight seeing.

A recommander vivement.

Hélène is very nice guest always available and understanding. The only down point is the apartment feels dusty and a bit old. I still would recommend this apartment for a few days of shopping and gastronomic break.

Je préviens l’hôte j’envoie des photos puisqu’on m’en demande mais rien en 4 jours
Nous avons très mal dormi et hormis le premier jour où nous avons communiqué avec notre hôte depuis c’est le silence radio !

35341382,516331037,2019-08-24,274305824,Ania,"My husband and I stayed at Patricia’s apartment for two weeks. 

The stay begun with Patricia meeting us at the train station and giving us champagne and a mini car tour of Paris. She shared restaurant recommendations a hair dresser (best haircut ever) and activities.  Because of her our vacation ended up so much better than I initially planned. 

Also the apartment is so gorgeous. It is decorated with antiques and has huge windows overlooking a courtyard and other buildings.  There are cascading flowers in each of the windows.   The apartment is full of light has a washer and drying racks huge closet and dresser great water pressure and the small kitchen is outfitted for a chef. 

Although the  neighborhood is not the center of tourist activity it is the center of all transit. We were able to get to all attractions with a single bus or single metro which was so fun because we got to see so much more of paris. There are also valib bikes around the corner and Uber was very affordable when we got back past midnight. 

The neighborhood is very safe. There is a boutique hotel bakery and restaurant across the street on the corner and every specialty store you need within two blocks (groceries clothing pharmacy post office deli). We also explored the neighborhood a little and the Giacometti institute is within a 15 minute walk The famous rotunda bar the Catacombs are also 15 minutes walk. 

We loved our stay here."

Close to a good bakery and food stores and restaurants. We would stay here again if we return to Paris. Only a short walk to see the Eiffel Tower which is so pretty at night with its sparkling lights!

3038482,29395829,2015-04-07,26539411,Corinna,Die Wohnung von Laurent hat definitiv eine 5-Sterne Bewertung verdient. Wir kamen in eine schön eingerichtete und vor allem super saubere und ruhige Wohnung. Die Lage ist zentral und durch die Metrostationen in der Nähe gut an das Verkehrsnetz angebunden.  Die Kommuniktation vor und während des Aufenthalts war super und die Beschreibungen für die Wohnung vorab waren sehr ausführlich somit waren alle Unklarheiten vor der Anreise beseitigt. Fazit: Alles in allem eine sehr schöne Unterkunft in der wir uns sehr wohl gefühlt haben mit einem tollen Gastgeber. Danke Laurent für den tollen Kontakt . Viele Grüße Corinna

The communication was TOP! Our 7-year old son was sad because we only stayed there for 1 night. So we will be back.
4250011,172836294,2017-07-22,122432106,Amanda,Richard was very flexible with our check-in and check-out times. The apartment was in a very convenient location very clean and comfortably accommodated the two of us. Richard took the time to walk us through the apartment and point out anything we might need. We loved the balcony! It was perfect for winding down after our busy days.

Das große Wohnzimmer ist sehr stylisch. Man fühlt sich sehr wohl."
573472,367238140,2019-01-04,46821037,Johnny,The location was great! I didn’t use the metro once while I was there. Very quiet room off the main streets.
5544688,354639698,2018-12-02,46556416,Lila,"PROS:
- Location: it is easy to walk to many shops and restaurants close to the metro station and the neighborhood is very charming. The apartment is on a quite side street off the main road. 
- Cute decor: the apartment is well decorated

CONS:
- the apartment smells like mold and the upstairs bathroom ceiling is covered in black mold. 
- only one shower: the only shower is located in the upstairs bathroom which must be accessed through the upstairs bedroom
- the bathrooms: the upstairs bathroom is covered in black mold and has no ventillation so nothing dries. the shower does not drain which causes flooding on the bathroom floor. The downstairs bathroom has no shower just a bathtub that is in the bedroom.
- the common space is very small
- the upstairs bedroom has no drawers or closet to unpack your clothes
- the apartment is teeny tiny with hardly anywhere to unpack or put things"
24195763,460753153,2019-05-30,127835166,Harry,"Having read the reviews for this place we were optimistic however we were left rather disappointed. Firstly when we walked in we tried putting the light switch on but there was no light. Instead we had to walk across the room in the dark to find a lamp. There was also only lamps in the bedroom. Secondly the curtains are pretty pointless as they let so much light in and people on the street above can see straight through them into the bedroom. The bathroom is tiny barely space to sit down on the toilet for a grown man. The sofa bed balances on a box so my mate kept falling off it when he slept on one side. We ended up just sleeping with the mattress on the floor.
Having said this we were not in the apartment much at all as we were at the French open most days so the quality of the apartment did not affect the enjoyment of our trip. The location is great. The snacks provided in the apartment were a nice touch. But overall it was the poorest Airbnb I have stayed in."
6773217,264552437,2018-05-14,56333436,John,"This is an amazing space!  Of course the location is fun and interesting - with good food and restaurants all nearby and lots of artisanal bakeries but the real star is the apartment itself.  Lots of space to cook (this is a kitchen that gets cooked in regularly) sleep and relax.  A beautiful set of windows - amazing light.  Perfect for two couples or a larger group traveling together.  We had my partner her mother and myself.

Small drawbacks: The shower is more of a tub - that was a challenge for partner’s mom.  Also we missed having an expresso pot - only a regular drip coffee machine - all else good!

I strongly recommend this place!"

15388631,137555272,2017-03-16,17628815,Daniel,Un endroit délicieux et romantique à souhait. Le logement est situé à l'entrée de ce qui est sans doute la plus jolie ruelle de Paris. Une sorte de mini village bucolique au cœur de la capitale. Idéal pour une escapade amoureuse (ou pas !) à Paris. L’accueil de Clotilde est sans doute le plus charmant constaté depuis que je pratique Airbnb . A consommer sans modération !!!

Friendly helpful and unobtrusive polite with a great sense of humor supports the French national team on football. With Michel you can deal with. The apartment is lovely it is located in a nice building the windows overlook the yard . To this building guides even lead excursions of tourists from the countries of the Asia - Pacific region. House is very convenient for walks and excursions of all kinds.

Tuvimos todo lo que necesitábamos y Patrick fue rápido al contestar nuestras dudas!! Destacar la comodidad de las camas nos hospedamos 4 personas y todos coincidimos en lo mismo fantásticas. Hay parada de bus a tres minutos andando parada de metro a unos 6 minutos muy bien conectada. Cerca hay un supermercado y justo enfrente una panadería. Sin duda si vuelvo a París quisiera quedarme de nuevo “en casa”. MUY RECOMENDABLE!!

22866848,547830028,2019-10-16,64806776,Paul,"As they always say in the real estate business - Location Location Location.  This property is in a great neighborhood with very nice restaurants sidewalk cafes and grocery and pastry shops.  Plenty of banks (ATMs) and pharmacies if needed.  Most of all there is something magic about walking a block or two and seeing the Eiffel Tower especially lit up at night.  The property is in walking distance to a downtown rental car location if one is needed.  In addition to the Eiffel Tower the apartment is very near and in walking distance to many other attractions

The apartment is immaculate with great security  and is nicely furnished.  It has a very well designed and appointed kitchen with many amenities.  I will definitely return here fo another visit."

In addition to three bedrooms there was a dinning room and a sitting room but we tended to aggregate in the kitchen which also had a good size kitchen table. Nice views! Extra pillows were very appreciated! Mai Thi was very responsive to our phone calls.

Close by restaurantpattiseriesupermarket  shopping etc. I recommend this place to anyone staying short or long time  (I stayed 2 Weeks). Wi-Fi is super strong. Neighbor is respectful and friendly.

21020472,259091280,2018-04-30,93422271,Karthik,Jean-Louis and his wife were warm qaand exceptional hosts throughout our stay. The room is cozy comfortable and filled with information about Paris. The private bathroom is spacious clean and well equipped. The location is strategic - close walk to the Eiffel tower on one side and the other side opens up to local Parisian streets and a market in a short walk. Jean-Louis was very prompt in communicating with us and gave us local tips. The couple laid a lovely breakfast spread every morning and we shared many stories while having breakfast together. I can't say how much we've felt at home in their apartment. We would definitely come here again next time. Thank you both for a wonderful time at your place.
19571604,247616506,2018-03-29,48972894,Martin,El departamento es muy lindo y cómodo y estaba totalmente equipado. Se encuentra cerca del subte e incluso pueden movilizarse caminando desde allí. El anfitrión es muy atento y responde rápidamente.

746611,58493489,2016-01-03,38737116,Fiona,Marie & Antoine's apartment was perfect for our family holiday. It was very spacious and clean and we felt at home. The apartment was as described and even better than the photos show as they've obviously done some renovating since they were taken. The location is superb with everything at your finger tips including the Eiffel Tower! We would highly recommend this apartment.
2788739,176137305,2017-07-30,48702732,Jennifer,Near the subway and nice restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood
13696220,107272792,2016-10-09,7559869,Bruno,"The hotel is well located and has a nice decoration. The room is on the top floor so elevator plus stairs what is a bit inconvenient but you get the windows to the sky. 

This also means that most of the room has  roof that is shorter than a regular one because of the inclination of the roof. 

Still everything was ok with the reception and the room. "
10948582,464766648,2019-06-06,58460263,Nancy,Wow! This place is spectacular. We slept two comfortably. It had all the amenities we needed. Close to lots of shops which are open later then other areas. Would stay again!

3509041,19415192,2014-09-12,19036360,Jennifer,Nathalie and her apartment were perfect. The location and the apartment itself could not have been better. The decor was beautiful and it really did feel like a quintessential Parisian apartment. Nathalie was very responsive to all inquiries and extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions all of which made the stay go very smoothly. The apartment was also provisioned very well. The only improvement I would suggest is darker shades on the bedroom window as the street lights are bright and make sleeping a bit challenging. If you bring an eye mask you'll be ok! We strongly recommend and would stay there again for sure.

1075591,74642294,2016-05-16,5420515,Susan,The apartment was a good option for our 2 night stay in Paris. It was bright with two large windows clean and simple. It had everything that we needed. The street outside has an active nightlife but the apartment faces the courtyard so it's not directly affected by the festivities outside. This was definitely a better alternative to the typically overpriced hotels. 
22415483,402647102,2019-01-19,42681963,Emma,Such a great apartment and great host! The apartment was really cute very clean in a great location and communication was incredible! They were also so accommodating with our late check in! Highly recommend staying here!
2840304,14366445,2014-06-17,15777474,Dafna,"We had a LOVELY stay at Julien's flat!
The flat is spacious and bright (just like in the pictures). The facilities are very high in standard. Julien was very welcoming leaving us all the information we needed including tips specific to our needs. He also left us some great treats for a continental breakfast (Tnx!). The flat is especially suitable for those traveling with young children and is baby safe but could also easily accommodate two couples. 
The flat is not extremely central in location but is a good walking distance from the city centre including a scenic walking route to the Notre-Dame. Also very close to 2 metro stations. Would love to stay there again and can gladly recommend. "

1441373,95560132,2016-08-20,17203143,Jonathan,"--Pros:

Location was unbeatable. The Marais neighborhood was really cool and walking distance to the Notre Dame Louvre even the Eiffel Tower if you have some time. There's a metro 5 minutes away which means the entire city is within reach (seriously use the metro while in Paris).

Basic comfort. The place was clean the bed was comfortable.

Internet and TV. Everything works.

Value. I mean come on. Hotels in the area are probably 3x the price.

Thierry himself. Super nice guy very responsive. Even though he was on vacation and we never met he was always trying to help us out.

--Cons:

Space. It's a little cramped. But remember it's in the heart of an expensive city. The shower is the smallest I've ever seen but it works fine.

Stairs. It's on the 5th floor (Europeans would call it the 4th because they start counting at 0) with no elevator and a tiny winding stairwell.

Heat. The place gets hot but there's a portable fan and an awesome skylight/window that kept things very comfortable upstairs in the bedroom.

Fire safety. Not really a thing in France so this problem isn't unique to this place. But there's nothing resembling a fire extinguisher or a fire escape and you're on the 5th floor of a very old wooden building.

---------Summary----------
We were on our honeymoon and had an amazing time hence the five stars on everything. There are certain kinds of travelers that this place might not be suited for. Like if mobility is an issue or if you're looking for certain standards of luxury. But for someone trying to experience Paris on a budget.... this can't be beat."
35709284,537805213,2019-09-29,251839959,Anthony,Everything was great and the space was neat and tidy. I was able to wash my clothes when I needed to and it had a nice view of the neighborhood on the balcony.

The apartment was clean and getting access was easy with no problems. Altgough not one of the top (more expensive) arrondissements the location was excellent close to restaurants supermarket and metro the area was busy and felt safe. 
There wasn't a lot of street noise in the bedroom at all so very easy to sleep."

We stayed there for 4 days till New Years Day. Albeit small the place has pretty much everything - so if you’re planning to spend most of your stay around and not indoors I’d highly recommend it! :)

20675339,438587060,2019-04-17,138954768,Robert,Matthieu's apartment felt like a home from home!  It is light spacious and well furnished and its location is perfect for exploring Montmartre (a few minutes walk away) and ideally located for the metro to take you to many of the great sights of Paris.  It is also perfect for anyone arriving by eurostar.  The local shops are excellent (3 boulangeries within a couple of minutes walk) and there are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby.  We were given a warm welcome by Matthieu's very friendly mum.   It was the best air b and b we have stayed in!

We were all blown away by the view and grandeur of the place and only wish the staircase and lift were refurbished so we could appreciate their beauty. However this didn't distract from our enjoyment of our time in Paris and feel very fit after several trips up and down. Thank you Dorothee for allowing us to stay in your beautiful apt.

Klein maar voorzien van alles wat nodig is. Alles in prima staat internet werkt prima en een fijne douche.
Erg fijne locatie in een aangename wijk die ook nog eens heel centraal  in Parijs ligt en dicht bij de metro.
Dat is ook een groot pluspunt als je veel van Parijs wilt zien in korte tijd  je thuisbasis is altijd dichtbij om even een tussenstop te maken.

6893144,181143929,2017-08-12,6662358,Elizabeth,This apartment is even more beautiful in real life with tons of natural light and homey charm. It was the right amount of space for our family of 5; the kids all stayed in the attic space. We especially enjoyed the terrace. The neighborhood is not far from the center of Paris but definitely off the tourist path and only a few blocks from the metro. It is within a few minutes from two amazing parks and the neighborhood has severel cafes food stores a pharmacy and two cute book stores among other amenities. This was a great find for our family and made our stay in Paris all the more enjoyable!

13665452,304283039,2018-08-09,54432368,Pamela,Frederic's apartment is truly beautiful and stylish and is well represented in the photos. The view is simply amazing and it is wonderful to have the calming presence of the Eiffel Tower visible and sparkling during your down town in the apartment. Public transportation is very convenient with a subway stop (Porte de Saint-Cloud) and bus depot a short walk away. There are laundry facilities (washer and drying rack plus supplies).  Also the apartment is on the 9th (top) floor so if you open the windows there is a strong cross-breeze and the apartment never feels hot despite the recent heat wave.  Also my kids had fun playing in the park across the street.  There is a very convenient pharmacy and grocery just at the corner of the block.  Highly recommended.  One minor note: on the last two days of our trip we rented a car and parked it on the street in front of the apartment.  When I returned in the morning it had been stolen so I had to spend my morning with the rental agency and the police to resolve the paperwork.  I would suggest that future visitors consider using one of the nearby garages to avoid this hassle.
33213021,466523344,2019-06-09,90638740,Nasser,"Perfect spot - we pretty much walked everywhere whether it was Montmarte for view Saint Germain or Rue Royal for shopping or just a casual drink and food at any cafe nearby!

Space - extremely spacious and cute decor. Got to love the crown molding on the roof :). The bathrooms were great and clean also.

6293721,166949817,2017-07-05,32423060,Andrea,I've stayed here before and it feels like home away from home now. It's bright comfortable and has everything I need. The location is fantastic it's a really easy walk (even with suitcases) from the Roissybus stop at l'Opéra from the airport and then you're walking distance from everything. Plus there's a Nespresso machine to help with the jetlag :) Check in was easy and communication was excellent. I'd recommend this place wholeheartedly... just don't book it when I want to be there again! ;) 
26151927,523242062,2019-09-03,151179837,John,Exceptional Experience would go back and certainly recommend. The staff are helpful the rooms are lovely and the balcony’s are lovely to sit out and have a drink. The rooms are cleaned daily and fresh towels laid out. It is in a great spot near a train and plenty of nice restaurants and bars. Can highly recommend this spot.

Het ontbrak aan niets voor een prettig en sfeervol verblijf met onze 2 grote dochters met als extra verrassing een akoestische gitaar. De buurt is gezellig met volop verse producten waar we gretig gebruik van hebben gemaakt voor een smakelijk en gezond ontbijt. Ondanks de afwezigheid van gastheer en -vrouw heeft het ons aan niets ontbroken en geheel aan onze verwachtingen voldaan!

588211,174899455,2017-07-27,36709136,Laura,I stayed in Aurélia's lovely apartment twice for extended stays. It was really wonderful -- charming apartment with all the amenities you would need (including fully-stocked kitchen and bathroom). The location is perfect: it's in the heart of the Marais and a stone's throw away from the métro. But at the same time her apartment is very quiet and peaceful giving out onto a beautiful courtyard and Parisian rooftops. Aurélia was very communicative kind and professional. I can't wait to return for my next stay!
38785392,544867881,2019-10-11,11984793,Alvin,This place is perfect! Really felt homey.  Location is near the cafe restaurants bar but still has the quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Place is well kept. Melissa welcomed us and showed us her welcome manual it was very helpful! Will definitely stay here when we go back to Paris.

Leise weil nach hinten heraus gelegen. Auto kann im Parkhaus Centre Pompidou geparkt werden das kostet allerdings. Sehr gute Kommunikation sehr zuverlässig. Würden wir wieder buchen.

12725102,282439507,2018-06-27,26936350,Sue & James,Samuel’s apartment is in a great location close to public transport and shops and supermarket for convenience. Lovely boulangerie close by too. The highlight of his apartment is the amazing view of the eiffel tower; our children were amazed by it. Thanking you kindly for accomodating our family; Paris was enchanting as always.
27630141,551505178,2019-10-20,240507719,Brooke,Our stay was very pleasant! The air bnb was a close walk to the metro and was in a very quiet and safe area. But for people who want to be right in the middle of everything it’s about 20 minutes from the center of the city. Host was very sweet and willing to accommodate but responses could sometimes be slow. Place was extremely clean and comfortable and had a great view. The WiFi was a bit spotty however and we had some trouble connecting on and off throughout our stay. All in all was a great experience and would definitely stay again!

11855658,348760022,2018-11-15,9908595,Marcella,"BEWARE of renting Pierre's place prior to construction being done--I would highly advise emailing him to see if it has been completed. We booked Pierre's place 2 months prior to staying there. About 2-3 weeks before we were scheduled to arrive he emailed us to say there would be construction taking place and we may hear a lot of noise between the hours of 8-5. He assured us he's slept quietly and good when he stayed at his flat. 

When we arrived the courtyard that was advertised in his listing was in shambles. There was literally no concrete or stable footing to walk up to his apartment. Bricks were in piles everywhere and everything was extremely dusty. We decided to make the best of it however. Upon entering the apartment was clean although a little smelly like sewage. I assumed it was due to the open pipes we saw due to the construction. It wasn't overwhelming so again left it at that. The next day the smell was stronger so I emailed Pierre asking for a candle and extra towels (due to there not being any napkins in the kitchen or dish towels we had to use one of our bath towels to keep the kitchen clean). The management team asked us to purchase these items and send in an invoice for a possible refund---I'm sorry but the last thing we want to do on our honeymoon is shop for someone else and not even be promised a full refund. 

To our lovely surprise the next morning I jumped up out of bed due to the insane noise of a jackhammer literally right outside the apartment door plus construction workers right outside the only window as well. The ongoing construction noise was such a pain and something we did not want on our honeymoon not to mention due to the construction there was literally dust that was blown into the apartment through underneath the door. After the first morning I sent in videos and photos to Pierre and the management team. Although quick to reply Pierre kept insisting he couldn't do anything about the noise but he would talk to his landlady. I guess he did because the next morning construction outside the door didn't occur until 10ish although the noise from the work being done on another part still woke us up (there is absolutely no noise cancellation in his apartment). On our final day the jackhammering began again at 8:30 although this time we were met with an even better surprise of the workers removing the temporary walkway and us not being able to even get out of the place. We had to ask the restaurant employees to please let us go through their kitchen with our luggage in order to get out. 

We were so upset that the only negative part of our honeymoon was this Airbnb. I've never had an issue with all of the places I've rented and I've never written a bad review before until now. I asked Pierre if he could compensate us for 2 of the 4 nights we stayed due to the excessive noise and false advertising and he ended up compensating us for less than what we paid for even 1 night. All in all even though his place was in a great location I highly recommend you think twice before booking this place (at least during the time of construction)."
28501392,474357597,2019-06-23,27906575,Sofie,Vincents house is fantastic we used it with four adults and really enjoyed all the spaces. Everything was very clean and Vincent was always available for anything we needed.

The apartment is well equipped we had everything we needed to shower sleep and even make breakfast.
The building is very clean and secured 4 minutes walk from Republique metro station or 40 minutes by foot to Hotel de ville/Notre dame area.
All in all a great experience we never met Anne but her friend Gëtan greeted us with the key in the middle of the night when we arrived to Paris and made sure we are ok during our stay."

Though we had a bit problem with the hot shower and washing machine but Joe was very cordial and tried to make things easier for us but since we had only a few days in hand in Paris we were always out when he tried to reach us. Overall it was a great experience location was bang on and it’s a pretty place. Will recommend.

18610419,235040646,2018-02-15,28007929,Nicole,"Stop reading and just book now!!! 

Our only hesitation in booking Laurence’s flat for a Valentine’s holiday in Paris was... this listing just sounded too amazing to possibly be real. Could an Airbnb really be THAT phenomenal — with better hosts amenities views(!!!) and location even than Paris’ most ritzy and exclusive hotels???Laurence shows it can be done (again and again as other reviews prove); we’ve stayed at the Shang-ri La and Pullman hotels and cost is the only area those suites exceed or even match Laurence’s flat! The listing has the exact feel of a curated reserve suite for VIP guests. 

The apartment is just as depicted though pictures just can’t do it justice. The Eiffel Tower is close enough to ask Alan Ducasse for a cup of sugar. The amenities like top-of-the-line appliances smart home studio lighting and an incredible art collection are at your disposal to enjoy. And most notably Laurence Fred and Malik are the most friendly generous and welcoming hosts you can dream to encounter and will go above and beyond to make your visit exceptional."

1518745,14902185,2014-06-29,11616176,Darren,The Dessins property is a great apartment - nicely decorated very clean and very nice bathroom facilities.  Perfectly situated in the Marais near the Republic it is only 2 or 3 subway stops from Hotel d'Ville / Isle Saint Louis.  Dessins is very nicely equipped with comfortable beds towels and linens.  The kitchen is totally updated with new appliances dishware microwave coffee and Nespresso machines etc. and more than enough of the basics for the 4 of us to prepare meals etc. on the occasions that we did.  The 2 bedrooms are adjoining but this was not a problem for us.   The apartment feels very secure as it looks onto an interior courtyard and is very quiet.  There is also a wonderful little outdoor deck just off of the kithen which was a nice surprise and quite lovely to sit out on to enjoy a glass of wine on during the quiet evening.  This apartment is very comfortable and we would easily come back to stay here again. Ludovic was very helpful regarding all aspects of our stay at Dessins and we very much appreciated his assistance.

1527271,17096705,2014-08-07,11882104,Leah,"We recently spent 3 nights here and were overall pleased. We have stayed in 6 airbnb apartments over our 2 month trip around Europe and this was the first apartment that is actually lived in by the host meaning there are personal items everywhere and it is not specifically  layed out for renting. This took some getting used to.

The location is good in terms of being near the stations a very conevnient 5 minute walk from Gare Du Nord and trains to and from all necessary locations.

The apartment is up 5 flights of winding stairs we booked knowing this but it was still such a struggle getting luggage up and down.

The apartment is a great size and has lovely natural light in all rooms. The lounge is comfortable and kitchen relatively well equipped we only wish there was a kettle. The bed is a double quite tight for two people but comfortable. The shower had good pressure and long supply of hot water. The balcony was nice to have a small view of Paris and for fresh air. The windows are also sound proofed.

Some negatives we found with this apartment was the lack of aircon;  once again we knew there was none when we booked but it can get quite stuffy in summer without it and leaving the windows open leads to uneccessary street noise. As the owner lives here; from a guests point of view there seems to be a lot of uneccessary items around that make the place looked cluttered and a little offputting as you dont know where to put your personal items when staying as all of theirs is in most places. Such as; kitchen cupboards bedroom storage etc. And finally there was a little lack of cleanliness; such as a full basket of washing some shower use marks in the bathroom  etc. All things that could easily be taken care of before our arrival but weren't. I must say Yannick was away during our stay yet im sure this could have been taken care of before we  arrived. 

In terms of communication with the host there were no troubles Yannick made sure we had all of the information and more necessary and was contactable whenever we needed.

Overall we did enjoy our stay here and would recommend it for the location and size of the property and ease of communication with Yannick."
20115960,272092743,2018-06-03,179440193,Claudia,La ubicación del apartamento es estupenda hay muchos lugares bonitos y buenos para comer y beber supermercados 3 líneas de metro están cerca así como paradas de bus que te llevan al corazón turistico de París. El apartamento es justo para tres personas aunque el sofa cama no es muy cómodo para dormir. Lo malo es que uno tiene que comprar o llevar sus propios implementos de limpieza como toallas de manos paños para secar pisos y platos porque el baño no tiene cortina y el piso queda mojado después de usar la ducha; aunque hay lavadora no hay detergente para lavar. Son cosas que los huespedes no deberíamos tener que comprar para una estancia corta.
5056099,73122365,2016-05-07,169684,Conrad & Jane,"Laure Anne made us feel very welcome; she was working in her terrace garden--on the 8th floor--when we arrived. The apartment is extremely spacious light and quiet. The neighborhood is ethnically mixed with south-east Asian prevailing; there is quite a variety of restaurants. 
Laure Anne's apartment is very comfortable and the kitchen is well-equipped. We would have enjoyed dining on the terrace but the weather was a little chilly for that. The views however were wonderful and we saw sunset behind the Sacre Coeur. The apartment is close to the metro so traveling around Paris is very easy."

573472,322830679,2018-09-14,136942222,Maria Jesus,"ATENCIÓN - IMPORTANTE: 

Realmente muy molestos con la situación que vivimos la noche que llegamos. Llegamos al edificio y no pudimos ingresar al edificio porque el código de acceso que nos suministró el anfitrión no era el correcto. Estuvimos más de una hora y media deambulando por las calles de París con dos valijas grandes y una de mano buscando un hotel en el cual poder quedarnos. Fue una situación horrible tener trasladarnos a esa hora con las valijas por las calles de una ciudad desconocida. Afortunadamente luego de consultar en por lo menos 5 hoteles logramos conseguir una habitación individual en un hotel. 

Lo mínimo que esperábamos de parte del anfitrión era un verdadero pedido de disculpas por la situación que nos hizo pasar y un reembolso inmediato de lo que debimos pagar en el hotel o al menos de lo que nos costó una noche en este apartamento. 

Todavía nada de ello ha ocurrido. Incluso nos comentó que tienen que considerar con sus socios lo del reembolso sinceramente lamentable la respuesta.

Respecto de cómo hemos pasado la verdad que estamos totalmente desilusionados con el apartamento. La realidad es muy distinta de las fotografías en la que nos basamos para tomar nuestra decisión. PUBLICIDAD ENGAÑOSA 100%.

Lamentablemente tuvimos otros malos momentos y disgustos con el apartamento. El último día no tuvimos agua durante gran parte de la mañana y de la tarde por las obras que están ejecutando en el edificio. Ese mismo día el caño del wáter empezó a perder por lo que no pudimos tirar la cisterna y lógicamente tampoco pudimos ir más al baño del apartamento. El water es electrico no se puede tirar papel es realmente desagradable y una verdadera porquería. Por último el detector de humo no dejó de sonar el ruido fue insoportable.

No le deseo ni le recomiendo a nadie que alquile este apartamento. La anfitriona es una verdadera sinverguenza y el apartamento no tiene ningún parecido con las fotos. Es una estafa que sigan promocionando el apartamento tal y como lo hacen. Todavía al terminar la estadía nos pidió que la evaluáramos bien (""If you have a spare time 
Could you please be kind & generously leave us a positive feedback overall rate more than 43 (if a review has under rated less than 4.0 evaluation  not only this flat but all other flats on my account will be blocked for a month which could not be able to let them to the guests during a whole month time...)  which can be enormously effect & seriously damaged our business by under rated feedback of 4.0. Ofcourse we are willing to hear your kind feedback to improve our service but in a direct & private way rather than in a public way. So don't hesitate to let us know  if there is things which you think possibly improve a condition of flat & better service."") una inmoral totalmente.

Sacha met us and went over everything we could possibly need to know for our stay. Our kids especially loved the ""cave"" bedroom. I noticed that a previous reviewer commented that there wasn't bedding for the couch but there was bedding for the couch when we were there. There was a little bit of noise and light late at night in the bedroom as it is next to a common courtyard but if you bring earplugs/sleep mask (which I always do when I travel anyway) it is totally fine. The neighborhood is incredible; we loved the proximity to the Eiffel Tower and the Metro and we pieced together several meals from the wonderful local shops. 

If you're looking for a fantastic location at an affordable price I certainly recommend Loic's place!"
33381637,480700153,2019-07-03,251581387,Dennis,The hosts will treat you well and make things as comfortable as possible. We appreciated the fact that they replaced a TV that was not working within minutes. They brought in a very large HD TV that was awesome. The only negative was the heat. But that was not their fault. We arrived on some of the hottest days in Paris this year. Our hosts made sure we had plenty of cold water and did all they could to make us comfortable. Fortunately the heat wave did not last long and we were back to normal.
1532445,144209690,2017-04-15,120268518,雅也,He is a reliable and kind host with a flexibility.
334304,339798910,2018-10-22,219355332,Mariana,The room and bathroom are very clean and the location has access to many restaurants and shops around. There is also a park behind the building. Marc was very quick to respond to my reservation!

8204658,68707502,2016-04-06,56030674,Steve,"Although we booked for 5 nights we only actually stayed for 4 due to our flight being cancelled because of the French Air Traffic Controller’s strike.  We were even delayed getting there on the day we arrived due to the airline backlog.  However Thierry’s wife was there to greet us even though it was quite late at night as Thierry was unable to attend.  However Thierry dropped in for a cup of tea and chat later in our stay.  On arrival his wife showed us around the apartment explaining where everything was kept in the apartment and where the local supermarket’s and restaurants were. 

This is a wonderful apartment having been completely refurbished during 2015.  It’s on the 4th floor with access by either a spiral staircase or a lift.  It’s situated at the end of a quiet cu- de-sac with no traffic noise apart from the other residents occasionally moving their vehicles.  We also heard no noise from either the apartments above or below us so when we were inside it was extremely peaceful. 

The apartment was an ideal size for 4 people with a large double bed in the bedroom as well as a large sofa bed in the lounge diner with adequate room to sleep 2 adults.  Although the kitchen is compact there was enough equipment to cook and it even had a dishwasher (and tablets) washing up liquid sponges tea towels etc.  There was also some basic foodstuff in the kitchen tea coffee pasta and toast.  There is a washing machine in the annex to the bathroom although being there for only 4 nights we didn’t use it.  The bathroom has a large walk in shower and basin as well as 4 hand and 4 bath towels; the toilet being just outside of the bedroom.

There is a large shopping mall about 5 minutes walk away with an underground Monoprix Supermarket as well as other ‘chains’ and ‘independents’ in the mall and vicinity. 

We weren’t there long enough to fully explore Passy but this was an ideal base being 10 minutes from the Metro which gave us access to all the major attractions.  If you are a French or EU citizen and aged between 18 and 26 by showing your photographic ID you gain access to the Arc de Triomphe and Louvre free and at reduced rate for access to the Eiffel Tower.

We would definitely consider staying there again."

Thevenin boulangerie was just across the way and one of my favorite and delicious memories of our stay!  We spent most of our time out and site seeing but it was a perfect home base for a good night sleep.  Bed was comfortable and roomy enough for my pregnant self and husband.  Merci!
5290064,229163419,2018-01-22,96495675,Kim,Maguy is a great host. She's friendly quick to respond to my queries. Maguy also serves good breakfast freshly made crepes with her own made berries jam.  The location is good there's a mini supermarket round the corner and lots of cafes and food places around the neighbourhood. Maguy does not speak English but that's not a problem with a translator tool. I enjoyed my weekend stay here.

7266674,85556290,2016-07-12,70811384,Irene,I didn't get the chance to meet Philippe personally but Philippe replied very quickly to all my messages and the communicating was very easy. He arranged Adam to bring me the keys for the apartment. Adam was very friendly and showed me where to find everything needed in the apartment. The apartment was compact but provided everything needed for visiting. The Pigalle metro is very close to the apartment and you can easily access all the sights of Paris with it. The best thing about the apartment was the lovely french balcony which from you could see to the little street and all over the rooftops of Paris. A very beautiful view! Thank you Philippe I was happy to stay in your apartment! :)

874864,518267011,2019-08-26,201045466,Sami,This place is at the right location for someone who likes bistros and entertainment. Very busy street at night. But the appartement is far and high enough from noise and disturbance. You are right in the middle of Paris close to sight seeings and metros. The only problem we had is that the apartment is on the 5th floor of a building without a lift...But aside of this Everything was just perfect for us.
3672320,308920300,2018-08-17,77192626,Lauren,This apartment was in a great location right next to a metro station restaurants supermarket etc. Check in was easy and the apartment felt secure. The plants have it a nice vibe and the coffee machine was really appreciated. They also let us check out late as we had a late flight. There was an issue with the wifi but that wasn’t a huge drama because we had our phones.

Celui ci est fidèle à la description et aux photos. Il est agréable et lumineux dans une rue calme. Nous avons apprécié y passer une semaine et nous y reposer après des journées de visites sous le soleil (bonne literie). Proximité appréciable des stations de métro bus et tramway. Commerces à proximité (notamment le monoprix ouvert jusqu'à 22h). Estelle nous a laissé des indications sur le quartier. Souplesse pour la remise des clés à l'arrivée et au départ.
592392,160917443,2017-06-16,75419861,Maya,Arsène is a lovely and welcoming host but also keeps to himself so it's like having the whole appartement to yourself. The appartement is located in the 2éme arrondissement which is very central only a short walk to many of the sights. The road that the apartment is on is great for places to eat and drink. The flat itself is very aesthetic typical bobo parisien style. Only downside it is a little dirty but not very.

28299078,460037405,2019-05-28,56258408,Rosalyn,We really enjoyed Maxime's little apartment on the 5th floor with 5 balcony windows.  They brought in fresh air a lovely view and plenty of sunshine.  We especially liked the stylish bathroom which looked brand new.  The building was protected by an entry code at the street-level and keys to the apartment.  The building was super quiet and being on the top floor felt safe/private since nobody has a need to go up there unless invited.  Maxime was easy to communicate with very nice and helpful.  The spiral staircase is tight so we do not recommend this place if you have full size suitcases or if you have difficulty climbing stairs.  Location was very good - lots of vibrant restaurants nearby and within walking distance South to Rue Montmartre and Blvd Haussmann if you want to explore by walking (but of course you can also take the metro or bus).  There was a supermarket nearby and a small market and popular bakery right across the street.  Gare du Nord is only 1 metro stop away and from there we took the RER train to CDG.
1138091,239308354,2018-03-01,91057006,Perrine,Even if we had to cancel our trip Stephanie was was really nice and understanding ! I recommend her as a host.

The place is very well located very convenient to different metro lines and tourist attractions. It is  not only very clean it is absolutely spotless. The apartment is spacious and so well decorated. It is very well equipped in terms of dishes seating TV towels fans for the summer. We will definitively come back and we highly recommend this place.

If you go during summer know that there is no air conditioning and the apartment gets very hot.  You will need to sleep with the windows open and it s a very lively and loud neighborhood late into the night and early in the morning.  

Because of the heat we were not able to sleep in the upstairs portion of the apartment even with the fan on."

Close to metro and the Canal St-Martin area which was a nice surprise with a lot of restaurants. And close to both Gare du Nord and de l'Est making the location perfect if travelling by train. Since the temperature dropped the two heaters were really good to use at night. We'll be back.

Kitchen cutlery was left seating rusty in the wet metal pot which is very unhealthy
 Toilet extremely small when you sit on it you have to put your legs on side to avoid hitting basin vanity unit to access the shower is very narrow gap between the radiator and basin if you are overweight you won't be able to go through there is a no TV or radio property only wireless speaker and Wi-Fi which couldn't connect second mobile phone fridge it was ok but freezer looks like never been cleaned before property is on the 4th floor has small 1 prsone box lift very slow me and my partner managed to squeeze in our selfs in  but was very squashed apartment is on 4th floor kind of quiet until you open your windows then is very loud because is located next to the High Street Boulevard very loud place and in very rough area main euro star train station is positive thing that is 5 minutes walk from this apartment I am hugely  disappointment for this apartment and price I paid which is really over estimated "

Neighborhood was great and close to multiple metro stations which made it easy to get around. Definitely will be looking to stay here again if I ever go back to Paris
20753087,411407516,2019-02-12,28589254,Feiyu,The apartment is cozy convenient and good taste. There are 3 metro lines around the place each within 5 mins walk. And the area has so much fun. Marc is a wonderful host. We arrived at early morning and he succeeded to let us check in very early. And the house is warm enough in the winter. I will definitely choose Marc’s apartment again next time in Paris.

2387929,516264544,2019-08-24,10882744,Michèle,C'est un appartement chaleureux où le propriétaire a une grande confiance en ses hôtes. Cela ne ressemble pas aux locations impersonnelles faites uniquement pour l'argent. C'est ce qui nous a plu sur les photos et que nous avons effectivement rencontré. Excellent pour un séjour relativement court. Il faut savoir  après que les repas sont pris avec une table basse. Cela ne nous a pas gêné.
15148556,264610874,2018-05-14,156842373,Igor,Eis aqui uma referência de um incrível airbnb onde tudo foi perfeito: apartamento excelente limpo bem equipado e decorado.

10666247,182223139,2017-08-14,14450318,Alexander,"Salim was very friendly and helpful! We also highly appreciated that he offered us the help with the luggage (as it was difficult to bring it to the sixth floor) despite our late check-in. 

The flat is very cozy and located not far away from the center.
The minor disadvantage is the lack of elevator however if you have not bring heavy luggage it should not be a problem.

I would highly recommend this place to everyone.

David's apartment complied perfectly with the pictures. Very clean good location as it is close to the Arc de Triomphe walking and whenever we had a question David was at our disposal immediately. If you come to Paris we highly recommend that you come here."
25078371,523796360,2019-09-04,25523139,Benjamin,What a great place and so close to some of Paris’ topics attractions. The apartment has a great layout and comfortably accommodates 4+ adults. The rooftop is a great place to sit and enjoy the views. We will definitely be recommending this apartment and will hopefully be back again soon!
33443971,518233369,2019-08-26,180477494,Nicole,"We arrived late in the evening due to a delayed flight. Transport was arranged by Pierre and Duncan and was reasonably priced. The driver suggested many areas for us to explore as this was our first time in Paris. 

We met Pierre early the next morning check in was smooth. Pierre is so friendly and helpful nothing is too much to ask!

The apartment is spotless all the facilities are great and Pierre and Duncan left basics in the fridge to ensure a easy start to our holiday. The apartment is stylish and chic perfect for two! Location is good straight onto Goncourt metro. At the Eiffel Tower in 25 minutes. 

We were recommended many different things to do and different restaurants and bars to try. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Pierre and Duncan. They went above and beyond lending us a picnic blanket and joining us for a glass (or two) of wine. They personify why AirB&B is better than hotels: great price personal service and brilliant recommendations. 

We can’t wait to come back! 

Nicole and Simon"
12826470,328069685,2018-09-25,121579260,Matthew,My wife and I just finished up our stay during our honeymoon. it was absolutely fantastic. Andre and Isabella added several nice touches to make our stay memorable. this included a bottle of champagne which we toasted at the Tour De Eiffel. Save money and us the metro. It's 1.90 EUROS per trip no matter the distance. we traveled throughout Paris for four to five days and spent less then 30 EURO on transport.
13031115,315655303,2018-08-29,163704997,Diego,I recommend this place to all families who decide to visit Paris. Near to the subway quiet and nice district with a supermarket at 3 mins. The apt is clean modern and wide as you can see in the picture.  Everything you need you will find it. Linna is reactive and accurate in providing info.

459184,36389657,2015-06-28,32192359,Linda,"Adrian was a wonderful host! He was thoughtful and responsive whenever we communicated via email or in person. 

His home is beautiful! Tastefully & uniquely decorated. Nestled in a courtyard his home served as a place to relax and recharge after each excursion in Paris. The bathroom is spacious and immaculate. The bedroom is cozy with automatic blinds (so cool!). And lastly the common room is spacious with large windows that let lots of natural light and fresh air in. 

The metro is easily accessible so exploring Paris will be a breeze. If you're looking for a location with a fun vibe but also tucked away in a private charming courtyard... this is the place to stay! 

Thank you Adrian for your hospitality!
Paris is truly a special place :)"

15341692,321350734,2018-09-10,203230837,Lulu,"Die Wohnung liegt sehr zentral viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuss erreichbar. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Restaurants sind gleich vor der Haustüre. 
Der Eingang zur Wohnung ist in einem Hof sehr ruhig und vom touristischen Lärm abgeschieden. Die Wohnung liegt im 3. Stock und das Treppenhaus ist schmal mit geschwungenen Holztreppe. Man muss sich bewusst sein dass es eine Altbauwohnung ist und es sehr hellhörig ist. Wer im Wohnzimmer auf dem Bettsofa schläft kann demnach die Schritte hören. Aber die Wohnung bietet alles was man braucht auch Kinderbett. Die Bettwäsche sind sehr angenehm schöne Gardinen und neuer Bad leider hat es keinen Duschvorhang. Gekocht haben wir nicht aber es gibt einen Gasherd Geschirrspüler Mikrowelle usw. 
Der Gastgeber haben wir leider nicht persönlich kennen gelernt aber er hat eine sehr nette Assistentin die einem bei der Schlüsselübergabe alles in der Wohnung zeigt. 
Fragen über die Wohnung wurden vorher alle beantwortet und auch während der Aufenthalt blieben wir in Kontakt.
Die Wohnung würden wir jederzeit weiter empfehlen."
12086068,70298896,2016-04-17,11118844,Jacqueline Ou René,Parfait vraiment parfait. Je suis parisienne enfin ex et j'adore le quartier je n'ai eu des contacts que épistolaires avec Sixtine mais ils ont été chaleureux et ont suffi amplement à faciliter notre arrivée et l'appartement en lui-même est charmant bien équipé parfaitement propre et suffisamment dépouillé dans son joli décor pour que l'on ne sente pas importun chez quelqu'un que l'on ne connait pas (j'ai été reçu dans des appartements où le linge sale était dans la salle de bain...) ou anonyme dans un hôtel. Vraiment bravo Sixtine j'ai passé avec mon fils un WE délicieux un peux grâce à vous. Je le recommande vivement.

13797199,231067521,2018-01-30,167923195,Maricor,"Marc is very hospitable and was kind enough to answer all of my inquiries from tips to transportation. He also communicated very well and clearly house rules and everything we needed to know during our stay. He also gave us welcome cookies upon our arrival which was very touching. 

The location is very accessible to grocery stores restaurants bakeries souvenir shops and such which makes it a perfect place to stay if one wishes to buy food souvenirs and essentials. The flat has a kitchen so it is also a big plus for those who wishes to cook their own food. 

It is also a really great neighborhood to talk a walk in. The Eiffel tower is about 10 mins away which made it extra special cause then we went to see the Eiffel tower in both day and night time without going too far away.

Overall the stay was really great and the host is absolutely welcoming and kind. We would recommend staying at Marc & Rumi's flat."

17213604,207857822,2017-10-30,10896054,Suma,I spent a week with my children at Olivier's apartment. Both Olivier and his wife were extremely gracious hosts ensuring we were comfortable and following up with us during our stay. They went above and beyond what I expected and bought beds so that my teenage children could sleep comfortably. The apartment is beautiful with Scandinavian touches and gorgeous lighting which I very much enjoyed after busy days exploring Paris. It's located in a lively yet cozy street of the 7th. A little gem of a street near all amenities. Thank you Constance and Olivier for opening your home to us and for your warm welcoming. We would love to stay in your apartment again.

25789405,551268653,2019-10-20,8911368,Susan,I had a wonderful stay in Mikael’s apartment. It is on an interior courtyard so was super quiet.  The bed is a Murphy bed and really comfortable. Nicely renovated bathroom although be aware that the wall is glass so if someone is cooking they will be able to see in. I was alone so it made no difference but if I came with my husband maybe it would.  The neighborhood is my favorite. Central to everything with multiple public transportation options. I’d definitely stay here again.

It's in a great location (walking distance to Montmartre and Sacre Coeur); close to numerous cafes bars grocery stores bakeries and charcuteries; has a metro station just a few steps away; and is extremely clean comfortable and cute! 

We loved the big windows that open up to the awesome view of the street which has typical Parisian character. The kitchen was brand new and had super nice appliances so we definitely made use of it. 

Aurora herself is an absolute sweet-heart!! She made herself available if we had any questions during our stay and was very friendly/helpful. She even went out of her way to leave us info about getting around to local attractions recommendations for bars and restaurants wi-fi access etc. 

Overall it was one of the most pleasant experiences we've ever had in an overnight stay. =)"
22028896,223018070,2017-12-31,48778739,Shiva,Jean-Pierre was a gracious friendly and thoughtful host. He provided tips about where to grab a cab from the train station and was quick to reply to our questions. We arrived into town late in the evening so he had breakfast food ready for us should we be hungry in the morning. The apartment was clean quiet and very cute. It had everything we needed including WiFi and we were even able to watch some French TV in our downtime. The apartment was also walkable to some good coffee shops and a wine bar we had flagged to visit. There is some interesting history in the area as well and a walk by the old hospital and canal is a nice morning activity. We would definitely stay here again.

13489520,538854024,2019-09-30,28946093,Gina,The apartment is comfortable and very nice and quite. It is a great place to escape the busy city. It is super close to several metro lines so nothing is too far away. The only draw back was the kitchen sink. If you plan on cooking a lot this may not be the place for you. We never created enough dirty dishes to use the dishwasher so we hand-washed everything but the sink is extremely small so water always went everywhere. This is a small issue but good to know if you plan on using the kitchen a lot.

The apartment is very cute and clean there is everything you need and more. In the morning we received breakfast. We were interested to see how the shared space works but it does. It turned out to be the best Airbnb experience we ever had.

4599794,513204330,2019-08-19,109861427,Francesca,L'appartamento è situato in una zona tranquilla e a  100 mt dalla metro. Comodo pulito e accogliente è un angolo dove tornare a fine giornata per rilassarsi e magari cenare (a 3 passi di numero c'è un comodo carrefour city). Un gioiello in una città bellissima :)

18909840,289369869,2018-07-12,60378445,Diego,The appartement is located in the 15th arrondissement very close to metro 8 (lourmel station) and tramway 3. There are many stores restaurants and French cafés around it. The place is small but cozy and you can reach Paris' main attractions in 20-30 minutes. It's ideal if Versailles it's on your must see list. However it could be cleaner. Kemal our host answered all of our questions in few minutes and was always kind. Overall we had a great time and we loved Paris.
1855118,115022205,2016-11-21,97478106,GianMarco,"Cozy and quiet apartment in the heart of Paris just steps away from the gardens of Palais Royal. The flat is bohemien-style perfect for 3 people (without using the sofa-bed). And AnnaMaria is so nice and helpful.
If you like all of this and furthermore you love far-east food (in the neighborhood there are the best oriental restaurants of the city) this apartment is a 'must-go'. "

Pode-se ir caminhando do local a torre Eiffel arco do triunfo estações de metrô e do trem que leva a Versalhes além da parada do ônibus turístico. Embora pequeno o quarto é bem equipado. O vaso sanitário fica em um cômodo fora do quarto e é utilizado por outras pessoas o que até então não era do nosso conhecimento. Sobre o David não nos conhecemos pessoalmente mas ele nos prestou todas os auxílios que solicitamos e inclusive providenciou táxi em nossos nomes.

7347425,312326045,2018-08-23,61038278,Tatevik,"I didn't meet Palma in person as she was not in Paris. From our communication I can tell that she is very kind helpful and super responsive.
The flat is cozy although a bit cluttered for me. It's in a greatest location possible as we were able to both use public transport easily and walk to lots of attractions as well. 
Unfortunately we encountered several problems during our stay - the wifi was not working the sheets were washed just before our arrival and did not get dry for the first 2 nights and the bathroom was not cleaned that properly. Palma was always there to give quick solutions online (instead of wifi we bought a local number with mobile internet and she immediately reimbursed the expense). However due to the fact that Palma was not in Paris the work done by the cleaner was not satisfying and Palma could not see that. There were items left by the previous guests in the bathroom (soap pieces toothbrush etc.). This was disturbing but I am sure that Palma will organize better with the cleaner in future."
33892916,497160413,2019-07-28,225788287,Sierra,Apartment was very nicely decorated very close to the metro and a lot of good restaurants and cafes. The check-in process was very difficult however as were the key drop off instructions.

1271817,351882752,2018-11-24,99797976,Karrie,"Emmanuel's place is very cute and in a great location. But I think it would be more enjoyable in Spring/Summer than in the winter as it was quite cold. There are also a few little updates that Emmanuel could make which would make it a better experience.

So first the good/great: The place is super-cute and perfect size for a couple. The kitchen is square so while the counterspace is limited (like nearly all Paris apartments) there's a nice sized kitchen table which could be used for workspace. We actually didn't cook there though so can't comment on the stove but it looked clean and fine. The location is also wonderful - right next to a Metro station shops/restaurants/bakeries etc. Feels like a local neighborhood but very close to the things a traveller might want to go and do/see. The neighborhood is quiet enough to get a good night's sleep which is really nice. The check-in process was easy.

The biggest challenge for us was that we were there in late November and the temperature was almost freezing at night. The place doesn't have any heat except for a few spaceheaters (one of which didn't work) and they just weren't enough to keep the place warm in the day or nighttime. The bedroom was the warmest - there was a big comforter and putting one of the space heaters in there (along with bundling up in sweats for bedtime) kept the small room warm enough. But the heaters just never got the living room or kitchen warm enough to really enjoy spending time in those rooms and the bathroom was freezing! Of course in Spring or Summer when it's warmer out this wouldn't be an issue.

There are also a few other little fixes that I think could make the place a little better and more comfortable. There are several loose floorboards. I love the rustic floors of older Paris buildings and have enjoyed staying in many other apartments with those but these floorboards actually were very loose and popped every time you stepped on them. I got a few splinters in my socks as a result. One of the curtains in the bathroom window is missing so there's a bit of a privacy issue there. The linens are also quite sparse. There's only 2 pillows with pillowcases a fitted sheet and a comforter. There are no extra sheets pillows or blankets. It would have made the living room more comfortable to be able to wrap up in a blanket in there. The pillows on the daybed in the living room also had no linens on them. And there were no blankets for that bed (though maybe that's because we told him there would only be the two of us).  There was also only one half-roll of toilet paper but going out to the local store to get more was not a big deal at all.

Overall we had a wonderful time in Paris. The location of this place is great. But a few fixes would really improve the experience and I think most people would enjoy the place more in warmer weather."
13724244,247594641,2018-03-29,42982114,John,Alain’s apartment is perfect for 1-2 people. Looks exactly like the pictures - extremely clean and brand new. Absolutely perfect location you can walk literally everywhere from it. If waking isn’t your preference there are many metros and buses just a short walk away. The apartment was so centrally located I was able to stop off midday to drop things off or pick things up without wasting any time at all. Absolutely would recommend anyone stay here - I definitely will again.

11718777,129130510,2017-01-29,16122749,Wout,It was great staying here! Fantastic location lots of lively streets and bars around and a real french bakery on the doorstep; fresh baguette every morning! However being 197m the bathroom was so small for me I needed to invent some new dancemoves to dry myself and put my clothes on. It was a pity I couldn't use the living room next to it since it lacks any curtains. While the neighbours might've enjoyed that I decided to keep dancing in the little box and eventually managed. But next to this little discomfort the rest of the appartment is brilliant. The bed itself is great soft and sleeps superb. All in all the place is just a great hangout for a weekend Paris!

19008442,242589995,2018-03-12,20768867,Scott,"We stayed here March 2018 for a family weekend away (5 people)

Positives - Excellent location next to Grands Boulevards metro station which is on two lines. Also great location for bars cafes and restaurants. 
The apartment was very clean and spacious and had three bedrooms

Negatives- fairly noisy street at nighttime
Apartment not finished had some electrical work to be finished which meant some bedrooms had no light switches in them and also the light for one bedroom meant switching a light in another room
Only one key which made life tricky when away with 5 people
Tricky main door to open even though was secure.
Single glazed meaning need for heaters to be used around the apartment

Overall a good stay and I would recommend here as the value for money 3.5/5

L'appartement est situé dans un quart animé et doté de qqs commerces à proximité. L'emplacement était idéal dans notre cas puisque nous devions assister à un concert au stade de France tout en nous permettant de rejoindre facilement d'autres spots à pieds (place de Clichy Montmartre) ou en métro.

Deux bémols cependant: il n'y a pas de penderie ce qui n'est pas du tout pratique lorsqu'on reste quelques jours. La salle d'eau/ WC est vraiment minuscule (2 m²) et un lave-main fait office de lavabo ce qui n'est pas l'idéal."

It’s well appointed with fast wifi clean and stylish - almost like living the local life! It’s in close proximity to the metro stations and the sights and the suggestions for local food delights are on point.

Il y a tout ce qu'il faut pour manger à 5 personnes c'est appréciable et des draps et housses de couettes pour tout le monde.

8087041,300864127,2018-08-03,26926871,Alice,"We were comfortable in Marie-Laure’s second-floor apartment (considered first floor in France) but had to use two keypads and a lock box to get into it. Her instructions were written clearly and when we had questions or problems (like how to get the TV to work) she responded promptly via email. She also left a bottle of red wine for my husband after I let her know that’s all he drinks (I don’t drink alcohol). That gesture was very thoughtful. 

The kitchen came with an espresso maker rather than a coffee maker and that was a treat once I figured out how to use it. The only real drawback for us was the street noise from people cars and motorcycles at night making it difficult to go to sleep even after midnight. And while safe the street itself wasn’t always clean. The nearby metro (subway) was very handy. 

We think this is ideal lodging for younger travelers but probably not the best for older ones like us. "

All of the basics for an excellent stay can be checked off the list: amenities appliances comfy bed well furnished and stylish etc. but there was also an exceptional iron and ironing board a nice kitchen lots of closet space large and well-lit bathroom with full bathtub windows from the kitchen and bath overlooked Notre Dame! The large window with terrace looking directly onto la Siene made for a very charming and relaxing time in the apartment. Not only could you enjoy the view from the main room but from the loft bed you had perfect view onto the river as well. A really wonderful and romantic spot lots of windows in the front and back skylight above the bed is great when it rains room to spread out and relax - I recommend you stay at Pierre's. Oh - it's on top of the building so 6 flights of stairs to walk - worth it though.

The apartment is in an incredible location local markets only a block away from wine shops bakeries supermarkets cheese shops. Champs Elysees  is a ten minute walk along with local metro. Apartment is perfect for two people and you will love the neighborhood.

16291731,344937083,2018-11-04,4534471,Davida,"Very beautiful Parisian apartment. Pictures are accurate and space is comfortable. 

Sleeper sofa is a little uncomfortable floorboards are squeaky and walls are paper thin. From what we hear most apartments in Paris have thin walls though so that is not uncommon. We have two young boys who were adjusting to the time change and were too noisy for the space despite our efforts to keep them quiet. I don’t think the space is ideal for younger children.

The apartment is super close to public transport across the street from a convention center and close to a supermarket. Elliot who checked us in was delightful and very helpful. Communication with host was fast and easy."
33776862,493310872,2019-07-22,27584575,Zuzana,It’s cosy and comfortable. There was enough space for a married couple like us to feel at ease. The biggest highlight for us was the use of the private balcony for breakfasts and meals overlooking the high street. Within a minute there are: a bus stop Metro station a Carrefour two boulangeries shops and a typical Parisian cafe.   We loved strolling down to the Seine Île de la Cité and Île Saint Louis most evenings.

Les sites touristiques sont rapidement accessibles par métro ou à pied. L'auto check-in et check-out sont très simples. Je remercie Clémentine pour nous avoir permis d'arriver plus tôt que prévu. Nous avons apprécié notre séjour chez Clémentine.

My family and I stayed over a hot weekend & were able to keep cool by securely leaving windows open overnight.  It was lovely to see the dimes of Sacre Couer from the balcony.
If you are driving there is a secure parking garage nearby and the flat is v convenient to the Paris ring road.
Ben answered my many questions very quickly and also allowed to us to have access to the flat for an extra hour at very late notice. Thanks Ben!

3134624,161248668,2017-06-17,22036447,Anne,Wir hatten ein superschönes Paris-Wochenende in der Wohnung von Jean-Francois und Marie. Schon in Vorfeld war die Kommunikation einfach und schnell. Marie hat uns empfangen was auch gut war weil wir aus Versehen an der falschen Eingangstür standen (hatten den kleinen Buchstaben hinter der Hausnummer übersehen und waren deswegen um eine Tür falsch). Aber nach einem kurzen Anruf kam Marie nach unten und nahm uns dort in Empfang. Die Wohnung ist im Hinterhaus. Vom Balkon aus hört man das lebendige Pariser Leben was wir schön fanden. Die Wohnung ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und auf der Ausziehcouch im Wohnzimmer haben wir Mamas sehr gut geschlafen die Mädchen waren im Schlafzimmer untergebracht. Die Wohnung ist im vierten Stock. Ein bisschen Treppensteigen ist also angesagt. In der Küche waren allerhand Gewürze und Tee vorhanden eine Spülmaschine und eine Waschmaschine aber kein Ofen. Zu Fuß ist man in drei Minuten bei Bäckerei U-Bahn Supermarkt Starbucks und am berühmten Moulin Rouge. Auf dem Balkon kann man gut zu zweit aber nicht viert sitzen. Der Esstisch reicht aber sehr bequem für vier und hätte sicher auch gut für mehr gereicht. Wir waren uns alle vier einig dass die Wohnung eine super Wahl war und empfehlen sie uneingeschränkt weiter!
5177732,37588736,2015-07-08,34040267,Saffi,Our stay was greatMarie/ Emannuelle  welcomed us when we arrived and went over everything. The room is on a different floor from theirs and was very clean for a longer stay it may be a little tight on space for more than one person but for our one night it was great. I would totally recommend this to anyone hosts were very helpful in pointing out where we needed to go and what train to take.

16864568,422471101,2019-03-11,72720417,Laura,This apartment is the place of every youngster's dreams - I wish I could stay here for a longer time. The interior is very cosy (a real inspiration for when I'll decorate my own place) the kitchen well equipped and the bed very comfortable. Checking in and out was very easy with the monkey-locky system. We had never seen it and were happily surprised! Overall a very good experience. I hope to come back here soon!

17596703,415685534,2019-02-23,176996736,Diane,John est réactif et cela est appréciable (explications très claires). Petit appartement bien situé et dans une petite cour très au calme. Bon rapport qualité-prix. Je recommande.
1173475,9885212,2014-01-17,8406459,Vinh,"We had an excellent stay in Jean Luc's apartment. Jluc doesn't speak any English but was always very polite and accessible via Viber. 

The apartment is TINY (it would be cosy for one person) but the space is VERY efficiently used and is well equipped with pretty much everything you need. The shower is a bit too small for my liking and the curtain sticks to you (pro tip: DON'T boil the kettle or use the stove while anyone is showering or the power will cut out leaving you cold and in the dark as I found out the first night lol) but you make do and it gets the job done. 

The location is absolutely excellent! Pigalle is very easy to get to via train and the apartment is about a 1-2 minute walk from the station. It's a 5 minute walk to the Moulin Rouge and within walking distance (though 20-40mins) to the Arc De Triomph and Eiffel Tower. Otherwise the trains are frequent and efficient also. 

We had a late flight on our last day and Jluc was kind enough to let us store our bags in his apartment after check out and pick them up later in the day.

Overall a pleasant stay but make sure you like the person you're staying with because you'll have virtually no personal space! lol  "

22079484,456279881,2019-05-21,163450982,Sharon,The perfect spot for seeing the sights of Paris without been in the middle of the chaotic city. Even been 2 woman we felt quite safe (didn’t go out after dark) and bus stop right at your door and lovely little restaurants (especially the Indonesian one below our window) and shops close by. Raul is friendly and most helpful and always willing to help where he can!

The only complaint I would make is that the check out process was a tad stressful. With check out being at 11am we had cleaners knocking on our doors at 10am and since the room is a tad small packing was difficult. With people sitting outside the door waiting for clean up and constantly knocking as your in a towel from the shower and trying to move around to pack it was extremely stressful."

18716781,171705552,2017-07-18,73774537,Nicole,A beautiful renovation of an historic Parisian building combined with Jerome & Christian's unique aesthetics - it was a lovely taste of Paris. I slept like a hibernating bear in the cave in a very comfortable bed. The dehumidifier provided cool air and gentle white noise. The wine coffee and fresh fruit was a welcome surprise as was the waterfall shower and luxe toiletries. I will definitely stay here again during my next trip - my only regret was not being able to stay longer!

79690,528980994,2019-09-14,2983550,Patti,"Nice little apartment in a really great  location across from Les Philosophes in the Marais!  

You can roll out of bed and walk across the street for croissants  & go to the little market down the street and turn left and get fresh squeezed orange  juice for about five euros a liter!   You can go down 1 block turn right and be in the Jewish Quarter ! Be sure to try Miznon’s for their cauliflower falafel and their broccoli with dill sauce!  

You will hear them partying at the cafe Les Philosophes until the wee hours of the morning and then the trash collection is at 7 am so it’s noisy.  It’s just part of Paris ! 

The apartment is nice. The master bedroom is upstairs ... you have to climb up a narrow  circular staircase.  We did not even attempt to take our luggage upstairs. Also upstairs is a large bathroom with a big tub… No shower which we would have preferred!

There is air conditioning but it seem to freeze us so we left the window open at night which was very comfortable except for the noise.

Overall this was a nice little apartment in a great location"

13202433,413286421,2019-02-17,209804431,Ramiro,La puntuacion hubiese sido de 5 estrellas pero en un departamento para 4 personas es inadmisible que el agua caliente no dure mas de 10 minutos. Para poder bañarnos todos teniamos que hacer combinaciones poco comodas (bañarnos en horarios no habituales duchas muy cortas dias sin bañarnos). La unica respuesta fue “estamos revisando el problema” pero nunca en 5 noches tuvimos la solucion. Si esto no se soluciona esta opcion es MUY POCO RECOMENDABLE

15225871,504094360,2019-08-07,39169447,Eric Et Christine,L'appartement de Sarah est très personnalisé aux antipodes de ces appartements anonymes meublés Ikea. Nous avons choisi son appartement situé dans un quartier très populaire pour son calme et sa sérénité revendiqués étant conscient de renoncer ainsi à toute vue sur Paris vu que ses fenêtres donnent toutes sur des cours intérieures. La cour principale était supposée être ''entièrement privée''. De fait elle est partagée entre 2 appartements par de simples panneaux de bambou qui n'arrêtent ni le bruit des conversations tardives et animées des voisins (parfois jusqu'à 3h du matin) ni la fumée des cigarettes ni les odeurs de BBQ. Egalement les cours font échos et l'on profite également de la musique des voisins de dessus de leurs disputes et de leurs ébas de réconciliation. De sorte que nous devions dormir les fenêtres fermés malgré les 30 degré C car des bouchons d'oreille étaient insuffisants pour amortir le bruit. Si l'appartement se soustrait en effet à l'effervescence du quartier environnant (gare hôpital boulevard autobus scooters ...)  il présente cependant un sérieux manque d'intimité. Cet aspect est complètement occulté dans la description du gite. Est-ce sensé être la norme à Paris ? Nous avons par le passé déjà occupé en été à Paris des gites bien plus calmes et nous aurions probablement orienté notre choix vers un autre gite si nous avions été mieux informés de cette réalité.
2904319,248876012,2018-04-01,77049950,Issam,"The apartment is perfect location 2 mins from the metro and from a good market and shops.
The host met us on time and was easy to communicate with.

The apartment is furnished with a antic furniture many old cabinet which in a way gives the apartment a special style but on the other hand they gather a lot of dust.
On entering the apartment the 1st remark question I asked if the apartment has been vacant for a very long time from the excessive dust smell.
Most visible surfaces are clean.
On the 2nd day I had to open a case to cancel the reservation as I had a burning eyes and my wife allergic for dust suffered too.

Another major issue was the sofa bed.  The apartment advertised for 4 but once opened the sofa bad as a very thin mattress (about 2cm) so we were able to litteraly feel the metal spring on our backs.  Add to that the mattress is about 110cm wide this way two narrow for two persons.  When I complained about the sofa size I was told it is fine for two kids.

A clean bedsheet is provided for the sofa a duvet and a second bedsheet presumably to wrap around the duvet.  But no duvet cover is present.  This means we had to fight with trying to keep a thin sheet between our bodies and a duvet that presumably  used by other guests.  So all in all bedding are poor.

The shower cubicle is also tiny.
TV is really tiny (as seen in pics) and cable box is erratic not sure if remote battery but we could not use it.

Wooden furniture are very old and some are unstable we had the salon table collapsed when placing a 3kg laptop on top the dinning table feet also very wobbly and felt like an accident to happen. 

On the good side nice nesspresso machine washing machine and dishwasher were really great convenience."
18205821,221918399,2017-12-28,72733334,Valerie,My husband daughter and I loved staying at Mathilda’s flat over Christmas. It is a short walk to Notre Dame and the Sorbonne. On a quiet street there is very little noise. Narrow winding stairs as is typical in many European buildings and we navigated them just fine as our suitcases were carry on size. TONS of restaurants and shops with reasonable prices. Mathilda is an amazingly responsive host and very kind. We would definitely stay here again!
20737452,348327004,2018-11-13,217429666,Tonee,Apartment was in a very safe building. Was nervous about where we would be staying for our first trip out to Paris but felt secured with the locks on the doors leading up to the apartment.

21573705,211193243,2017-11-12,102965621,Alberto,"Milene was very nice and kind to us. Unfortunately we got a very annoying during our stay: the bath tubes were leaking down the stairs outside the apartment leading the neighbour our last night to turn off our water. As a result we couldn't take any shower and we had to deal with strong smells coming from the bathroom. 
That situation as the neighbour confirmed already happened in the past and although it's not Milene""s fault we think that some works have to be done in a charming but old apartment."

Great location- 2 mins walk to bastille metro and an easy walk to Gare de Austerlitz (for RER train to Versaille an absolute must do!). Carre Four supermarket banks restaurants bakery are all at the door

There are many lovely neighbourhoods within an easy walk from the appartment- Marais and St Garmaine were my favourites. I can also recommend (Website hidden by Airbnb) for their chocolate tour (Website hidden by Airbnb) for cooking classes and catching an evening  classical music concert at Sainte Chappelle. 

Thanks again Brigitte-Marie!"

3436453,342147721,2018-10-28,218094447,Lauren,"Era una estancia agradable. Nathan era muy amable y siempre nos contestó rápidamente a nuestras preguntas. Era un espacio cómodo para 3 personas; quizás no para 4. Es bueno si se quiere ir a Disney y está bien ubicada a por lo menos 2 estaciones del metro. 
Al principio era un poco molestoso intentar abrir la puerta porque el picaporte está roto. Tuvimos que seguir instrucciones muy específicas del anfitrión para pillar el proceso pero después de eso no nos resultó demasiado difícil.
Al llegar por la noche notamos que nuestras toallas estaban mojadas todavía / no se habían secado bien que fue un poco pesado. Tampoco había suficientes almohadas. Nathan era muy agradable y ofreció ir para comprar alguna pero al final no pudo por un compromiso de su trabajo. Improvisamos con los cojines del sofá. Después de 3 noches ya no había bastante papel higiénico y no pudimos encontrar más en el piso. Además no había ningún basurero.
Sin embargo al final podemos recomendar este piso. Está bien si vienes por un finde y si vas a estar mucho fuera y sólo quieres un sitio para dormir."

Pénélope is a willing and helpful host who provided ample communication before and during our stay. 
We were in Paris during in the middle of a heat wave which made the studio a bit hot at night but totally bearable in the end. 
We would love to come back again and take advantage of the many wonderful amenities of the place and all the neighborhood has to offer!"

The apartment was very clean and equipped with all the amenities needed to make our stay enjoyable - from a Nespresso coffee machine and capsules to detailed guidebook for the apartment including local tips. Nicolas was very responsive to all of our questions and even left us a small welcome surprise in the apartment. The apartment is located inside a closed courtyard with a locked gate which made us feel very safe and very quiet despite the street outside being fairly busy at times. 
We would definitely book the apartment again for our next visit to Paris!"

22568885,495432911,2019-07-26,74393951,Lesley,Marie-Helene made excellent contact and arrangements. This is in a most convenient location with great public transport services. It is small but the area works well. The apartment is up narrow stairs no handrail so not for anyone with walking difficulties. & difficult with large luggage. The apartment is well equipped with utensils fridge cooktop and microwave. Breakfast was not provided in any way. If smoking worries you there is a smoker below so this wafts.

Master bed is unusually large for France. Neighborhood has great shopping restaurants two grocery stores and easy access to mass transit. You can walk to the Louvre!  It's a lively neighborhood but soundproofing effectively blocked street noise. Only real downside: water pressure was not great in the shower. I'd definitely stay here again.

48592,540296013,2019-10-03,78089291,Tim,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Delphine's for 5 nights in late Sept/early October. The host and guest manager were very responsive on the day of arrival even accommodating an hour earlier arrival than first indicated. Upon arrival the lift was out of service making a four flight journey up a winding staircase with heavy luggage rather unpleasant for two of us in our late but healthy 60's. Chris assisted my GF with her luggage though. Fortunately the lift was operational within a few hours and worked fine the rest of our stay. 
We did not do any heavy cooking only frying eggs for breakfast a few times (I can only eat so many croissants and baguettes for breakfast as is typical in Paris). Disappointing that there were no napkins or paper towels provided or pepper (there was salt). Toaster kettle and Nespresso machine all worked great (you'll need to buy pods and tea at the nearby Monoprix though as none are provided) as did the induction cooktop with easy instructions provided. The cooking/eating tools are very basic. There is also a combo washer/dryer available but we did not use it. Beds and furniture were comfortable. Wifi worked very well and never had a connection issue. TV is French language only.
The area is superb only a couple of blocks off the Champs Elysee. Metro bus stops grocery restaurants bakery and amenities are all within a couple of blocks. Easy walk to Arc deTriomphe Eiffel Tower Seine museums and other Paris landmarks. We enjoyed our stay here."

Boulangeries pâtisseries cafès and an organic mini-market just a few minutes away. Lovely Falafel/humus restaurant/take away on the same road. 
Got to visit the park as it is a real sight. Free Tai Chi lessons daily at 9am; set the alarm clock!!! 
Nearest underground station:  Laumière about 10 minutes walk. Line 5 which takes you to places such as: La République (Le Marais quarter is less than a mile away from the station) or Bastille if you fancy a stroll along the Seine.
Direct buses to Montmartre too if you have had enough of the underground. 
Thanks Brad and Marie for your hospitality.  We loved staying at yours (and I also loved your plants). Your place is a gem and you are great!!!"

Montmartre is so charming and in the local area there are lots of charming places to eat and drink. Sacre Coeur is about 10 minutes away on foot. Laurence is a very attentive host and flexible as regards arrival and departure time.

27800243,466431169,2019-06-09,24040781,Myron,My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights and had a wonderful time! The location was so convenient because it was very walkable and it was so close to the Tuileries Metro station! Since it was our first time in Paris this made getting around very easy. We loved having an elevator to take us to the fifth floor the location felt very safe and had two locked  gates we didn’t have any noise from the neighbors and they had a washer which was a huge plus. The windows did open out to the street side which provided a comfortable breeze they can be closed to reduce any   city sounds from the street. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again on our next visit.
2029559,167514782,2017-07-07,20160534,Isabelle & Kurt,Nous étions deux familles avec chacun un appartement le scénario idéal une bonne proximité avec de l'intimité pour chacune des familles. Nous avons beaucoup aimé le quartier de Montmartre vivant mais moins touristiques que bien d'autre.
1916690,18988699,2014-09-04,18148322,Natasha, Hafedh' s sister (Amel) was really nice with us when she received us to give the keys of the apartment. She explained everything to us. The description of the apartment is exactly what it is. It is well decorated and well planed. Very cosy. The neighborhood is really nice. The metro station is just a few steps from the apartment.  In the street of the building you can rent bicycles. In the plaza where the metro station is there is a Market one coffee house Mc Donalds Boulangerie (bakery) and many restaurants nearby. It is also really close to the Sacre Coeur. We really enjoyed the place!

18912511,158103338,2017-06-05,68797178,Sonya,They were amazing and the view was incredible. They are so knowledgeable and kind. I would recommend and return. The place is clean and safe. They know the city well and can offer great tips. They were soo accomadating when our flight came in late. Seriously such a great stay. 
30786190,422543464,2019-03-11,26539922,Julia,"Stanley is a great host. He offered help with tips of the city and the apartment surroundings told us what the best supermarket was and offered us the best service with fast response and an extremely polite team.

The apartment is extremely clean well decorated and of good quality. It is really close to the Louvre and a very Japanese Udon restaurant called Kunitoraya.

You wont regret renting Stanley's place!"
29703418,483029165,2019-07-07,38044153,Brandon,Amazing location. Small place but it has everything you need.  I would  definitely stay there again with my family.

3477049,198045354,2017-09-28,18899712,Suzanne,Thomas communicated well and the view was spectacular. We had a couple bumps in our stay though; no toilet paper on arrival and wasn't exactly clean. As he stated it's an experience.  You will not get anything fancy it's just the basics.

1133596,147911325,2017-04-29,116761343,Daniel,Clean quiet room in a great neighborhood.  Easy to get to from the metro and walk anywhere.  With Zazie it feels like your staying with a Parisian friend.  Getting to know her and her husband was a highlight of the trip.  The toilet is private but not connected to the room like the shower.

4938870,260936277,2018-05-05,52713029,Cynthia,The place was adequate. The building is very secure and that was nice. The apartment was clean and had a washer/dryer and hot water. As far as the location it would not be fair for me to comment. Paris was not my favorite city so I have little to say about the area. I am not a fan of the begging garbage and homeless sleeping everywhere. The apartment and communication though was excellent.

13678989,280397593,2018-06-23,149136847,Scott,Great location extremely helpful staff and cosy room! 
22329843,466254989,2019-06-09,62809615,Hannah,Great location and fun place to stay spacious enough for two and a good sleep with a sofa bed. Quite strict check in and out times which was a bit stressful especially as we didn’t have somewhere to store our bags so had to pay at the station. Someone turned up at 10 exactly to check we were leaving. The partner service recommended by Akila unfortunately wasn’t open on Sundays despite stating it was online and taking our payment. I’d suggest just leave your bags at Gard du Nord service instead.

7123790,47703801,2015-09-21,15955327,Judith,"Antoine was really friendly and even though I unfortunately communicated some things last minute he was keen on finding a compromise and we solved it in the end! The flat is nice and matches the pictures the area is very central. The flat is in a somewhat ""too secure"" building it might be a problem when you want to enter and leave it separately (with one set of keys) but maybe Antoine has a solution for this too! Antoine and his family usually live in that apartment. Thank you for renting us your apartment in the heart of Paris!"
8269878,91166074,2016-08-04,55122085,Elizabeth,Great studio apartment! It is small but is all you need if you plan to spend most of your time out exploring Paris. The location was great; it is a few streets up from the main busy streets so it was quiet and close to a lot of restaurants and about a 5 minute walk to the metro. The apartment was clean although the bathroom floor could have used a good scrub. We were provided everything we needed except that the air conditioning advertised in the posting was not available. Julien said the air conditioning unit was at his sister's apartment and he was unable to bring it to us. It would have been nice to have the AC since it did get quiet hot and that was one of our primary search criteria for an apartment. 
20529487,472780659,2019-06-20,18818605,Mark,The apartment was in a great location in Montmartre and the view was definitely the selling point but the place was a little smaller than expected and not cleaned to the standard we expect from an AirBnB (generally dusty etc.). Communication was excellent with the host - replies were very quick.
4347104,421301457,2019-03-09,43934651,Louis,Lara vous accueille chez elle avec beaucoup de générosité. On se sent bien loin des appartements qui ne servent qu'à la location. un vrai cocon un vrai chez soi. Lara a été extrêmement arrangeante merci encore !

Merci Nicolas!"
752341,27718983,2015-03-10,26536191,Ana Cecilia,Los días que pasamos en el lindo departamento de Anne y Joel fueron espectaculares. La vista desde el dormitorio de la Torre Eiffel es genial. Tomar desayuno en la terraza y por supuesto la atención de Anne y Joel. Ellos siempre te recomiendan los lugares donde ir te dan las indicaciones del metro sugerencias para el próximo viaje y siempre tienen una linda conversación.  Creo que las palabras quedan cortas por lo bien que nos atendieron.

28193958,524540671,2019-09-06,60610183,Alexandra,A beautiful parisian flat near the city center! Flavie quickly replies to the message provided us with an apartment at a convenient time for us to arrive and leave. The apartment has a coffee machine sofa bed shower refrigerator and everything you need. Wifi works very well and there is even Netflix. Nearby there is a grocery store (down Rue de Blanche) a trendy and very beautiful Pink Mamma restaurant many souvenir shops and all sights within walking distance. The apartment was quiet and comfortable temperature.
25235719,362368130,2018-12-26,5429069,Maaike,Cosy little gem in one of the best neighbourhoods of Paris.  Super clean and well renovated with all the necessary comfort. One of the most equipped kitchens we have ever had in an airbnb. Good bed and shower. Check in and out were flexible and all Holly's instructions were very clear . Lots of little bakeries butchers vegetable shops wine shops etc. in the neighbourhood. Easily connected with Paris thanks to the Voltaire metro around the corner. Recommended!
7312306,55380376,2015-12-01,26905432,Laura,"Carole was a wonderful host she made us feel so welcome and so easy and lovely to communicate with. She was so accommodating for our check in and check out times (always a concern with AirBNB!) and any questions we had were quickly answered by text. 

The listing was exactly as described - the apartment was every bit as inviting charming and comfortably luxurious as the pictures promise.
The location couldn't have been more ideal and despite being in such a central popular location the apartment was super quiet which made sleeping extremely restful. 

Would absolutely stay at this apartment again or the other one she has listed because of Carole!

13693386,434663270,2019-04-08,110462238,Anu,Don't hesitate to make a reservation if this apartment is available it is the hidden gem of Paris! You have everything you need with a beautiful balcony facing south you may want to stay in more than you thought :-)  Best possible location boulangerie supermarket brasseries and bars in the streets some vegan restaurants nearby as well. We loved it and will be back!

38271325,553072383,2019-10-23,1552284,John,"This was a great apartment in a great neighborhood. This was our third visit to Paris and the third different arrondissement we’ve used as a base. The neighborhood was safe and extremely quiet for where it was. 

This is a neighborhood where Parisians live which means there are lots of excellent boulangerie patisserie bars and restaurants very close by. 

Lots of Metro stops are close by including Gare du Nord so you’ll have no problems getting around. If you prefer walking it’s a straight shot down Rue du Faubourg Poissonnière to Les Halles in 2e and that walk will take you through countless places to eat drink and shop. 

I give this apartment and the host my highest marks and highly recommend it for a stay in Paris."
21285903,480234606,2019-07-02,105344730,Elizabeth,It is a stylish apartment which feels like Paris from a hundred years ago but with modern appliances and bathroom.  The balcony was a lovely spot to people-watch before going to bed or enjoy the sun in the mornings.  Pain Pain bakery is only a block away and there several close grocery stores.  Many local shops and lively restaurants were within a few blocks.
546396,2029074,2012-08-19,2745774,Anya,I didn't personally meet with the host Hslene but her daughter Julia who did a wonderful job of explaining things and welcoming us Fantastic location and great little apartment thankyou.

179149,334387231,2018-10-08,7836485,Wasima,This tour was a highlight of my trip. Made is a passionate and charismatic as well as spiritual guide. He is so proud of his country and presents it well. It was a great insight into the spirituality of Bali. Besides the main itinerary every stop was magical including visits to a rice terrace wood carving studio villages and other things one could never find on their own. Made kindly handled the whole group's cameras and constantly took photos for our memories. I could not ask for a better morning.
530324,13517079,2014-05-29,15330748,Jean,The flat was great and the communication from Nicolas was excellent. The flat was nice and clean and just as described and photographed. Convenient location too!

Tony made everything a breeze to coordinate and was very accommodating. The flat is cozy and lovely and was very clean and well taken care of. 
24225215,485066719,2019-07-10,135958533,Jim,Stylish apartment well located in the 1er and close to all the important sights and sounds of Paris. Marie is very attentive and helpful and the apartment has everything that you need to help you explore the city. We had 5 adults and 4 children and while a bit tight Marie had all the things we needed to accomodate our family. Much recommended.

31923097,527639070,2019-09-11,283455410,Jennifer,Great location! 1 minute walk to two different metros and 2 minutes to Monop' the grocery store. We loved having a washer and everything you could find in a standard kitchen (especially a corkscrew!)  You can even cook food on the stove top with pans and utensils and reheat with a microwave. The place is great for two people and the loft has a slightly firm but comfortable bed. (I did bump my head a few times but I'm very clumsy before I have my tea.) Overall would definitely recommend 
25530812,349044583,2018-11-16,7185426,Tony,Great place in a great neighborhood. We wish we could’ve stayed here longer. Comfortable bed nice bathroom full kitchen and all the amenities  you could ask for. And quite charming to boot.

3355541,36090486,2015-06-25,30803061,Kathleen,We had a terrific experience at Christophe's place in Paris!  Christophe was very nice and gave great instructions to meet him at the place and close out at the end.  Wonderful location - took us less than 15 minutes to get to Gard du Est train station from the flat and during our stay we were able to walk to everything.

12086068,97119909,2016-08-26,76773014,Philippe,"Our stay at Sixtine's place was rather good. The Apartment looks just like on the pictures and had enough space for the three of us. Furthermore we had everything we needed to prepare dinner at our disposal (from microvawe to toaster).
Whenever we had a question Sixtine would reply within an hour which was really great !!

The only real problem is the noise the small streets generate at night. It won't bother you at all if you keep the windows closed but with the heat in Paris during our stay this became quite problematic.

Besides that Sixtine's apartment is a great place to stay for a Paris Trip due to its great location at the heart of Paris !!"
4071903,84985015,2016-07-10,59603775,Henri,A lovely studio within a green courtyard where silence is just interrupted by the sing of the birds whilst being at the very heart of the lively Marais. Pierre is really nice and welcoming ;

Tuve la mala suerte de enfermarme justo después de llegar a París así que pasé bastante tiempo en el apartamento y me sentí muy cómoda porque tenía todo la cocina muy bien equipada el baño con agua caliente la cama confortable para dos y el proyector de tv estuvo genial para ver videos :) 
Lo único malo es que está en el cuarto piso y no hay ascensor."

There is a couch that can be made into a bed in the living room.

Other than that - pleasant stay nice host - would recommend!"

Made for a very memorable stay and one I wouldn't second guess to repeat. Definitely would come back to stay. Breakfast was good. Staff was friendly. Short but steep walk to Montmart to sit on the steps of the Basilica of the Sacre-Coeur to watch the sun set and the city of light come to life all around you.
11529623,121456334,2016-12-17,54751448,Mariam,Pierre's apartment was very neat and comfortable. He also explained everything in a clear way and was always responsive and reachable.

16769186,160692394,2017-06-15,37996899,Christina,Cute little place. It seems there's a children's school nearby and it was quite noisy in the morning starting as early as 8 AM . A few minor things here and there such as no pot for cooking (only a pan) but overall it was a nice stay and I would recommend it if you don't mind smaller places.

20644176,201841981,2017-10-09,21591173,Sarah,My stay was brief but overall great location and complex with proper amenities.  I would only comment that the studio was rather chilly in the evenings which was not ideal (though it may have to do with the large windows & door to the outdoor space leaving much of a wall exposed to outdoor temperatures). I would definitely consider staying here again on my next trip.

2464417,229203853,2018-01-22,166626742,Declan,This is a superb location right beside the Louvre and within walking distance of a lot of tourist Paris. The apartment is on a quiet street with a mini market boulangerie wine shop and a few bars within 100 metres. What's not to love ?The Uruguayan restaurant next door is divine. The apartment itself is roomy and reasonably well appointed but nothing special either. It was plenty warm in January ! It wins hands down on location.
509357,7698763,2013-09-30,6625601,Rosalie,"Jacqueline's apartment was a stylish and comfortable home away from home for me. I had a month in Paris and had stayed in a hotel and a studio apartment but my week here was the pick of these accommodations. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen and bathroom were roomy. The toilet was on the small side but wasn't a problem for me. The apartment was in good condition beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The unit is on a busy intersection but because it is on the fourth floor and the windows in the lounge room are very sound proof noise wasn't a problem. The apartment is on the corner of the building so has extra windows and opening these gave a beautiful breeze.
I didn't meet Jacqueline as she was away but had good email communication at all times and a lovely man met me exactly on time explained things to me and made me feel welcome. 
I was a woman travelling alone but felt comfortable walking around the area on my own. It is a lovely neighbourhood with easy access to a metro and buses. It is an area mainly occupied by locals rather than being part of the frantic tourist spots. I felt completely free of any need to watch for pickpockets which I had started to find wearing after three weeks in Paris.
All in all if I am lucky enough to go back to Paris and I have started plans to do that I would love to stay in Jacqueline's apartment again."

On a une belle vue sur les toits du Marais et même le génie de la Bastille. C'est un 5e étage sans ascenseur - mieux vaut être en forme ! Mais une fois en haut cela vaut vraiment le coup. Adrien est un hôte parfait très sympathique et réactif. Je reviendrai sans hésitation !

The location requires a 5-10 minute walk to the metro and I overall I felt safe walking the streets. There is a supermarket a few steps away for some home-cooking.

The neighborhood was was very convenient close to transportation and lots of shopping. However the size of the apartment was much smaller then pictures represented. There is building construction going on next door and work started at 8:am everyday. If you like to sleep in this would not be possible.

Although the street is very busy from lunch onwards till about 3 am.  Apartment is well appointed with all necessary basics. If you are wanting a quite evening - ear plugs are a must.

1237967,245700590,2018-03-23,27404014,Jonathan,Appartement bien situé dans Paris proche métro et transilien. Quartier vivant et sympathique. L’appartement est grand et plutôt confortable. Néanmoins les photos ne sont plus très à jour (l’ancienne disposition avait l’air plus sympa) et le ménage n’avait pas correctement été effectué. Martin est très disponible arrangeant et à l’écoute.

Under his apartment there are many good restaurants and bakery which has won 1st place for baguette in Paris. Located in Chatelet easy to reach any place is Paris. Highly recommended ! "
1234270,14732857,2014-06-25,12633441,Kathryn,Our stay was great with 2 adults and 2 five year old children close to the metro bus RER.  Kitchen fully equipped.  There was some confusion finding the place as the address listing on the Airbnb website is incorrect - it is number 208 not 228.  Ela was very helpful after waiting for an extra hour for us to find the place and made sure everything including wifi worked before she left us.  Our advice is to get a taxi from CDG airport for a family of 4 to the apartment as it is $40 euro compared with $33 via RER and then you have to walk with luggage 15 to 20 mins.
5746988,100845588,2016-09-11,22309876,Anthony,I stayed at Zelia's place for a few nights. I stayed in a private room and shared the toilet and bathroom with Zelia's family. It's a corner room right next to the toilet and bathroom so it felt like I had my own personal toilet etc. The location is a bit far from the historical city center but is close to metro stations and a train station. I did not get to interact much with Zelia (or her family) because I was out most of the time but she was very helpful and responsive via text messages. Overall good!

Die Wohnung liegt im ersten Stock eines typischen Pariser Wohngebäudes aus dem letzten Jahrhundert. Die Wohnung ist mit einem Aufzug erreichbar. Geparkt haben wir in einer naheliegenden bewachten Garage. Zum Be-und Entladen kann man vor dem Haus kurz halten.
Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und gut organisiert. Es gibt eine wunderbare Dachterrasse eines kleine Oase im hektischen Paris. 
Die nächste Metrostation (Pyrénée) ist 5 min zu Fuß erreichbar. Der Park und nette Restaurants liegen direkt der Tür. 
Christine war sehr hilfreich und hat uns persönlich empfangen und uns nette Tipps gegeben.

We enjoyed walking everywhere- 15 minutes to get to the Seine River 20 minutes to Montmartre 30 minutes to the Louvre.  Pierre's place was spacious and well appointed (a nice bonus was the espresso machine so that we could enjoy coffee in the morning!).  A big balcony to relax at the end of the day.   We loved the place and want to come back soon!  Thank you Pierre!

Thank you for your lovely hospitality.

12924754,545968191,2019-10-13,262872351,Ghada,Vadim was. the greatest host ever. He pampered me like a baby.  As a single woman in a foreign country it can at times be  stressful.  He is very responsive  extraordinarily helpful. At one point on a Saturday of all days I was in extreme pain and needed a chiropractor.. I was overwhelmed by the daunting task of finding one in a foreign country. I asked Vadim and he hooked me up with a local chiropractor and made all the arrangements for me! All I had to do was to get there. His apartment has everything one could need for a visit. And his neighbors are nice. too. Thank you Monsieur Vadim!

The house was really cool and the room and bathroom were great they have everything you could need. I loved sitting on the balcony in the evenings for a drink and there's a coffee machine in the room which was a lovely touch. Our only critique was that the room had quite a bit of dust built up. Although the room was still clean there was obviously so much dust around. Amahi was extremely quick at responding to our messages and her daughter very kindly helped us check out at 4am so we could catch out flight. They were very accomodating.
Thanks!"

It is an amazing place to get some writing/artwork done if you're into that sort of thing. It is a very small space so I wouldn't have more than two people.  Tamara was great at communicating and keeping in touch. If I come back to Paris I will be staying here again :)

He's extremely helpful and responsive to messages. The location is good. Very close to 3 metro stations and quite lively. We actually chose to walk everywhere in order to see more of the city  but the metro was super useful for arriving and departing. All in all great experience and would definitely stay here again. 
1586457,107624811,2016-10-11,8945933,Kim,The adress was a little confusing to look for but a great location to and from the main tourist spots. Taking an uber from this location to places was cheap and reasonable as this place is pretty central to everything. Will definitely come back someday

404717,206406131,2017-10-25,148660496,Ruth,Three of us stayed for a week in Noelle's place and we loved it. The space was beautiful and Noelle was very welcoming. The flat is very close to the metro and after a couple of days we were zipping around the city with ease. Good food nearby and the market on Friday and Tuesday just outside our front door was fabulous. I would be very happy to stay there again!

The umbrella definitely came in handy for the occasional rain. Also the location is absolutely amazing. Very close to the Eiffel tower and the trocadero landmark.

507193,72550064,2016-05-03,26551867,Jade,Joseph is a very easy-going host. He gave clear instructions about how to get into the flat. The location is excellentI pretty much walked everywhere. If you prefer to take the metroit's also very short walk to several metro stations.The room arrangement is slightly different from the photos but it's still very lovely and luminous.Overall I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend to single travelers or young couples.
5654383,232771071,2018-02-06,133288834,Christine,We live there for a week it’s good with 2 people but quite crowded with three people. Location is at the centre Paris and many attractions are reachable. There is three hair dryers in the house but two of them is not useable also there is no cooking oil provided we managed to buy it in a near shop. Overall clean and nice place.

Elle était charmante et très disponible par rapport à mon heure d’arrivée et mon heure de départ. L’appartement est bien situé. Cette partie du 13eme n’a pratiquement pas de touristes donc on peut avoir une expérience « authentique. » L’appartement est spacieux calme et agréablement meublé.  Le bâtiment est vieux (et sans ascenseur. . . encore de l’authenticité !) mais la cuisine et la salle de bains sont modernes. Le wifi et la télé fonctionnent parfaitement et Julien a beaucoup de livres si vous ne voulez pas sortir. J’espère louer cet appartement lors d’un prochain séjour.

4667235,88859772,2016-07-25,12559598,Janina,Fantastic experience! I stayed in Patricia's house with 2 friends for 4 nights and we like it so much! The apartment is very stylish big enough clean and very well orgonized great location in a heart of bohemian Montmartre. Patricia was very helpful easy to communicate and we felt very welcome. I would definetly recomend this apartment for these who wish to get real French experience in a cosy place. Thank you Patricia! 
2961618,537901646,2019-09-29,28585821,Kay,This place is all about location which was as perfect as it gets.  Plenty of cafes restaurants grocery stores all kinds of shops taxi stations 2 metro lines and of course so many places were walkable.  The place was spacious enough for four adults without feeling cramped.  The sofa bed was however uncomfortable enough that we took turns sleeping on it.  But once again the location made up for any shortcomings.  We would definitely stay there again.
20132542,471336321,2019-06-17,229424724,Lisa,"Die Lage und der Preis sind unschlagbar. Besonders luxuriös ist dort nichts aber wer tagsüber die Stadt erkunden möchte und nur eine schlafmöflichkeit sucht ist hier genau richtig.

The place was easy to find and at a great location close to grocery shops restaurants and attractions all within walking distance. The heater was a great addition since it can get cold at night and the beds were super comfortable. The interior was spacious and cozy and I really liked the layout. I took the loft which was cute and had its own little sunroof. Overall we had a nice stay and an awesome time in Paris!

1644892,285251469,2018-07-03,21035338,Anna,"Fabulous stylish apartment close to Gare du Nord and very easy to find on foot after a very long flight from Australia. The apartment is ground floor in a building with a central courtyard with a caretaker who was able to check us in far earlier than a hotel would which was a welcome relief.  Supermarkets and  Boulangeries are very close and a suberb restaurant is just opposite ‘Les Arlots’. We walked easily to Sacre Coeur a little further to Galeries Lafayette etc.
Our daughter slept on the sofa bed and found it very comfortable but it would only sleep 1 person.
Strongly recommend- this was our best trip to Paris!"
13201706,125145269,2017-01-04,79268192,Joy,Tatiana was a spectacular host. Very easy to make ourselves at home during our four day stay in Paris. Great neighborhood close to trains easy to navigate to major attractions or enjoy the antique nooks and crannies of the 11th district. Highly recommend!

2820550,308347206,2018-08-16,198746908,Katherine,Stay at Charlotte's place if you're looking to reach most sights by foot or quick metro rides! You'll feel right at home in the heart of Paris. We loved being able to just go downstairs and have lots of cafes and shops to chose from. The neighborhood is super LGBTQIA+ friendly. Sidenote: this apartment is only for solo travelers or very close couples as the bathroom is in an open hallway between the kitchen and the bed. Overall great stay!

We were really really glad that we stayed at this place cuz this view of the Eiffel Tower from here is beyond what words can describe. Since Victor wasn't available one of his friend greeted us and made us feel really comfortable. The place as such was clean and comfortable. I would recommend it anytime !

Não conhecemos nosso anfitrião pessoalmente mas ele foi super prestativo conosco!!

Foi uma ótima experiência e com certeza nos hospedaríamos lá novamente!

Unfortunately we don’t speak french and when we were greeted by the mother of the host we struggled to understand. But she was lovely and we managed to communicate through hand gestures and (Hidden by Airbnb) translate! 
Would recommend for a small trip away at small cost."
5192156,84477161,2016-07-07,21324838,Lindsay,As our arrival time changed Jenny was responsive and we appreciated her flexibility in working with us as to this and when we departed. The apartment was welcoming spacious and had everything we needed and more for our stay. Wi-Fi worked great and helped plan our day. Metro station was less than a minute walk away and there were wonderful restaurants and bars around that Jenny referred. Overall a pleasant experience and place to unwind during our trip.

27151459,506988560,2019-08-11,159560223,Tu-Anh,We were caught by surprise the very moment we first stepped into the flat because everything looks far more beautiful and shiny than the pictures on the website. The flat has such a stylish aesthetic home decor and a comfortable cosy vibe. We got everything we need for three days in the kitchen and the bathroom. In addition the flat is very close to the metro station as well as near to many local shops and restaurants. Anne was also very friendly and helpful with quick responses every time we have questions. We’ve had such a pleasant stay at this flat. Highly recommended!

36438080,525229535,2019-09-07,120135715,Jorge,Great place to stay in Paris. Really convenient due to the proximity to the Gare du Nord and other public transportation.
24169575,435077058,2019-04-09,80955850,Crystal,"Kathou’s place is exactly what you’d imagine when you think of Paris. It’s a beautiful little place in the heart of Paris. Hidden away in a private courtyard. It reminded me of a movie scene! 

Kathou’s husband met us when we checked in. We were fortunate enough to be able to check in a little early since we had our luggage which was great. He met us and gave us the key and a tour of the studio apt. Also letting us know if we needed anything where they were located. Prior to meeting we’d be messaging and they had been very responsive. 

The apt is right in the middle of a busy street but tucked away on a private courtyard so that we slept with the windows opened and felt safe and tucked in and didn’t have any noise each night. I wish we had stayed longer. If you get a chance to book this place don’t walk! Run! If I’m ever back in Paris I will for sure book this place again without question."
6332449,63472664,2016-02-23,18561671,Amy,"Chris met us to check us in early so we could leave our bags and start exploring the city! He was super friendly and took us on a short tour of the neighbourhood to share the sights and restaurants. 

We picked up fresh bread and pastries from a local award winning bakery and had an amazing dinner at Le Richer where we were sat at the table overlooking the kitchen. Would also highly recommend the Grand Marnier Soufflé at local restaurant La Regalade Conservatoire."
15448542,325663467,2018-09-20,210101815,Theo,Excellent location! Photos and description are deceiving. The place is very small and has no bed. Other than the description there is no luxury! Hot water only for one person second guest showers in lukewarm water at best...

Highly recommend the accommodation (very stylish and what you imagine when you think of Paris) close to Eiffel tower great local restaurants and metro. ideal location if you want to be close to the action whilst blending in with the locals.

2170489,13695538,2014-06-02,11721469,Heather,Sophie was a fantastic host who was easy to keep in contact with... she booked us an amazing restaurant just around from her apartment in a very pretty square when I enquired about a birthday meal...and it was fabulously spoiling. Sophies apartment is... clean charming and interesting the beds were comfortable and it was a lovely setting to come home too at the end of the day... We walked and scooted everywhere from Sophies apartment...Our 3 children aged 71013 quite happily shared the bunks beds and loved it...they also discovered the Boulangerie 3 doors down from Sophies apartment where they would get there breakfast before scooting of to discover the sights of Paris...We had such a lovely time in Paris and coming home to Sophies was the icing on the cake...
5079785,235577130,2018-02-17,31921296,Katie,Mai's place is great! Great location great amenities (amazing bathroom well-supplied kitchen) everything! The space is really great for a 2-4 people 2 powder rooms (one on the main floor and upstairs loft bedroom) plus the amazing basement with a HUGE bathtub and walk in shower. Location in Latin Quarter is great. A little bit of street noise during the day but it quiets down at night. There is a bit of noise from other apartments in the building during the day (just things like furniture being moved) but during the night it's very quiet. Mai had AWESOME communication skills and although we didn't actually meet in person we knew everything we needed to know! Super helpful having a little guide from Mai on how to use the washer/dryer kitchen equipment etc!
8934621,148092303,2017-04-30,115208714,Ana,The apartment was perfect for what we needed on a 6-day stay in Paris. Small but cozy with all the important details: microwave hair dryer kitchen material heater and also a TV. Phillippe was a really nice host and always available. We totally recommend this place!

1768627,271708949,2018-06-02,6347670,Hye,"Very nice and charming appartment perfect located in a very interesting and busy area of Paris close to Sacre Coeur.
It was clean and spacious comfortable to spend some rainy evenings there and calm at night and the view from the tiny balcony was amazing. We could do a lot of activities on foot but it's also close to the Metro and only a short walk away from the central stations (Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est).
Jean was a nice host. Absolutely recommandable."
19689918,270832381,2018-05-30,13096826,Henry,Great location & good communication. 2 beds very comfortable. 3rd is in a tiny box room with no windows so best for 2 couples. Thank you.

33470198,490830368,2019-07-19,35948083,Christopher,Lou's outstanding apartment is spacious and stylish and a really welcoming place to spend a few days in Paris. Even though it's in a very busy quarter the apartment is really quiet. It's ideally situated close to the Métro so getting about its very easy. Lou himself is a super friendly and helpful host and all communication was just as you would wish. I'd recommend Lou and his apartment without hesitation.
2861782,34934332,2015-06-14,21317405,Julie,Appartement propre fonctionnel  bien situé et calme. Tout y est. Je deconseillerais  peut être aux personnes claustrophobes et qui n'ont pas notion comme moi de ce qu'est une chambre de bonne la superficie est un peu juste...  Mais rien à reprocher sinon c'est très bien! Je n'ai pas rencontré Aurélie mais sa maman s'est occupée de tout et à été adorable. Merci et bonne continuation !

The place is near Eiffel tower so after you get out from Metro or train you can clearly see the Eiffel tower. The room was clean the kitchen and toilet as well. I really recommend this place to stay in Paris.

189589,47403506,2015-09-18,16841103,Nathan,Great location- lots of good cafes and restaurants nearby. The room is a decent size  - not the best place if you want to cook or prepare meals.
29159113,427959429,2019-03-24,127041916,Marie,Appartement propre fonctionnel et bien situé. Andrea nous a accueilli en urgence et nous l'en remercions !

601294,2114817,2012-08-27,3069452,Jessica,Irina's apartment was well-located and had everything my boyfriend and I could want. The place has lots of charm while still being clean and modern. Loved hearing the birds and French music from the courtyard. Irina was a wonderful host and a joy to interact with. Would love to stay there again! 
34386803,511371436,2019-08-17,147394802,Catherine,L'appartement de Lola est très bien situé dans Paris. Le métro est en bas de la rue les commerces ( boulangerie supérette ...) sont à proximité. L'appartement est suffisamment fonctionnel pour un court séjour  et très silencieux avec le double vitrage. je recommande cet appartement.

847662,524576088,2019-09-06,194464710,Евгений,В целом жильё оказалось неплохим хотя и не совсем оправдало ожидания. Нет естественного освещения в комнате где жил. Наличие мышонка в качестве соседа. При этом Отличное расположение: много кафешек рядом торговая улица с разными вкусностями. Легко добираться пешком до достопримечательностей. Хозяина видел один раз. Все общение через почту. Никаких проблем ни с жильем ни с хозяином не возникло. Оценка 7 из 10.
17646769,243528433,2018-03-16,50262299,Adam,Good value for money and a good location.
9306348,111441845,2016-10-31,73194300,혜림,이 곳에서 삼일간 지냈습니다. 공항에서 숙소까지 지하철로 한시간정도 걸려서 멀다고 생각했는데 막상 도착하고나니 집이 너무 마음에 들었습니다 ! 또 호스트께서 지도에 직접 맛집을 표시해 놓은것을 보고 감동받았습니다. 파리 중심가까지 가려면 40분정도가 걸리지만 일정이 끝나고 돌아오는 발걸음은 굉장히 가벼웠습니다. 이 곳은 아늑하고 따뜻하고 편안했습니다. 다음에도 파리에 온다면 한 번 더 묵고 싶습니다 
1283584,342711612,2018-10-29,5300757,Juliette,On se sent très bien dans la chambre louée par Véronique ! La literie est très confortable - la chambre avec sa SDB permet une complète autonomie. Photos conformes au lieu - l’apt est très calme et très lumineux ! Le quartier est vivant et bien desservi par le bus et le métro - je recommande vivement de réserver chez Véronique!
7639505,253749208,2018-04-15,35292374,Ornella,A la hauteur de nos espérances ! Maison moderne et agréable ! Nous avons passé un super week end dedans jardin cosy ! Merci Franck de nous avoir fait confiance
22786195,523746504,2019-09-04,34683261,Dmitriy,Philippe's place was as described small but perfect for a couple or small family (maybe with one child). Though it is in a popular area the windows face the interior courtyard so there is no bother from the noise of the street. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to others!
32097669,543126662,2019-10-07,57302235,Erin,Zina's apartment is great! So stylish and cozy! It's on a nice quiet street and the building is awesome! We did not have a vehicle and used Uber to get to and from places Zina's apartment isn'tfar from all the must see tourist stops!
3019600,65332143,2016-03-13,272484,Daisy,Another fantastic stay!  Great hosts who are always available and in contact should there be any questions.  Fantastic area clean and always comfortable.  Looking forward to returning again!  
629017,285700933,2018-07-04,5682589,Daniel,Very well located apartment operated by an agency group that was promptly responsive to our communication. We highly appreciated the experience and would definitely recommend.
12841466,293498465,2018-07-20,160236607,Jackie,Corinne est une personne sympathique et serviable. Son accueil a été chaleureux. Sa présence sur place loin d'être une gêne m'a au contraire permis de résoudre plusieurs problèmes. Le quartier est tranquille et bien desservi. Quant à l'appartement il répond à mes besoins. 
8136227,56113922,2015-12-09,24414279,Johannes,We lived four scholars (in their 40s) in the flat visiting a conference and the flat worked really well for our purposes. The kitchen and sofa is a natural social centre and the rooms are nice peaceful and two bathrooms helps the logistics with 4-5 people. The area is very nice a calm street with plenty of nice cafés and restaurants just around the corner. Celine were very helpful always quick feedback very clear instructions check in/out was smooth the flat were in great condition with linen towels and everything. This is an excellent place to stay in Paris!

5170184,80543871,2016-06-18,52536229,Jürgen,Unkomplizierte Kontaktaufnahme. Legerer Umgang so dass man sich sofort wie zu Hause fühlte.
2961654,292097927,2018-07-17,44866186,Erik,The place itself was what I expected. I have nothing bad to say about it or the location. It was close to a metro stop restaurants and supermarkets. We were welcomed by a Bnbsitter which was a little confusing because we had received contact information for a sitter that ended up not being the one that was meeting us so we stood outside for a while figuring out who to contact. There was no toilet paper in the restroom so we bought some. There was also a trash bag left (I’m assuming from the previous people) and I didnt know where to dispose of it. I’m probably nitpicking as I travel often and usually stay with superhosts but I wouldn’t mind giving Aaron’s place another chance. Grateful that he let us stay in his apartment.
2720332,498789293,2019-07-30,221728900,Philip,This is a great apartment. We loved it and had a fantastic stay.

1593430,133687351,2017-02-24,71757390,Ellen,En fantastisk leilighet i en spennende bydel. Alt vi trengte og mere til var rett utenfor døra. Her kunne vi handle til frokost samt spise lunsj middag og shoppe i umiddelbar nærhet.  At leiligheten lå i 5 etasje gjorde at vi ikke på noen måte var plaget av støy. Anbefales!!
576657,175163721,2017-07-28,135393488,Delphine,Attention les photos ne sont pas à jour sur le site. L'appartement est bien plus petit et moins fonctionnel que ce que l'on pourrait penser. En effet des travaux de cloisonnement ont été réalisés et n'apparaissent pas sur le site.
32712492,511461260,2019-08-17,268187091,Katie,I highly recommend this place in such a great area with lots of restaurants and bars as well as great travel links with the metro only a minute away. Would love to come here again.
1410402,80025536,2016-06-15,58590992,Shane,Hello our stay here was very good. Typical Parisian apartment. Felt very safe in this apartment complex. Description in how to get to the apartment was very easy to follow and the host was very polite to us especially considering we were over there for Euro 2016. Location for us was very central and very near a metro stop. So good place for us. If I'm back in Paris I'd definitely see if this is available. Thanks Francois
12859925,96868387,2016-08-24,73416534,Romina,Celine es una excelente anfitriona estuvo a disposición en todo momento para ayudarnos en todas nuestras consulta y necesidades. Fue una experiencia muy linda el departamento muy acogedor y cerca del metro. Lo recomendamos. Gracias por todo Celine

22333372,241406538,2018-03-09,165857480,Christina,Quiet neighborhood outside of the city center with lots of nice places to eat as well as public transit only two or three blocks away. Highly recommended!
10077605,86291818,2016-07-15,8596279,Robin,Simple convenient accommodations. There are some nice neighborhood cafes and bars nearby around Rue Legendre that are well off the beaten touristic track. Didn't meet Arthur because he was out of town but his buddy was there which was fine. You use a passcode to enter a courtyard and from the courtyard another passcode to enter the building and then a key to get into the apartment. The room is small but cute. You have a window that opens up onto the courtyard from one story up. There is also a stain or mark on the wall next to the pillow apparently from people's heads rubbing against the wall. I don't know. There was also a dark stain on the sheets. If you would be freaked out by that this might not be the place for you. Otherwise it's nice. 
1309488,39767796,2015-07-26,34284972,Avdo,Abosolutely fantastic apartment very good location  metro about 2 minutes walk there are many restaurants bakeries and supermarkets nearby. Very clean quiet at night and comfortable . Helpful and friendly host. My family and I recommend Eric's place!

2525655,254815293,2018-04-18,3456552,Maria,Charmigare än så här blir det inte! Högst upp alldeles under taket ligger Valéries kryp in. Frilagda bjälkar trägolv möbler i gammal stil. Men ändå alldeles modernt med badrum tvättmaskin micro allt vad man behöver. Allt var rent och fint och inrett med verkligt personlig charm. Läget är perfekt med många barer caféer restauranger runt om. Centre de Pompidou bara ett stenkast bort. Likaså de judiska kvarteren i Marais. Lite längre bort Paris mest romantiska torg Place de Vosges. Metron och RER-station kort promenad bort. Valérie svarar snabbt och bra. Hennes pojkvän Stéphane som tog emot var hjälpsam och vänlig. Jag önskar jag bodde på riktigt i Valéries lägenhet!

3466240,54385509,2015-11-19,46238789,Maxi,"El departamento es como se ve en las fotos pequeño pero muy cálido y cómodo. La cocina esta muy bien equipada para cocinar ahí. La ubicación es muy buena. Con respecto a Jacqueline no tenemos mas que palabras de agradecimiento. Llegamos a París el 13 N a la mañana previo a los atentados y su comprensión y atención para con nosotros lo vamos a recordar por siempre. Además es importante decir que la portera del edificio Maria habla castellano y es una dulce y atenta mujer. 
Muy recomendable!!! Gracias Jacqueline"

17473646,278923651,2018-06-19,50244084,Maggie Sur-Han,Etienne-Marie is an exceptionally warm and friendly host. He responds our messages quickly and welcomed us with enthusiasm and lots of local insights. The room and the apartment are spacious and clean. The view of the balcony is fantastic! The location is superb that many historic sites and museum are within walking distance. Etienne-Marie did not live with us during our stay so we have a lot of privacy. Even if he would enter the apartment he did inform us in advance and always rings the bell. We felt much trusted and safe. I would highly recommend this apartment/room for those who want to truly enjoy the life and pace and beautiful cityscape in the convenient classic Latin quarter.

While we were only staying for one night we felt comfortable and cozy and even enjoyed a glass of wine on the balcony (coats on since December is a bit chilly).  Quiet location but very close to shopping. Easy walking to Notre Dame Louvre and the Left Bank.

Próximo à estação de meteo Republique onde tem várias integrações com outras linhas. Bairro tranquilo. Apartamento muito confortável e espaçoso. Além disso a Evelina é um amor de pessoa! Super atenciosa e sempre disponível! Super indico!
2067461,32173261,2015-05-15,870550,Aixa,The apartment is just as pictured. It was very cute and very well located. There are three metro stations to choose from plus bus stops. It is a short walking distance from Centre Pompidou and from Marais. It was comfortable and quiet. The bed takes up most of the room but this was not a problem for us as we had closet space. It was very comfortable as well. The lights in the house if pressed once light up half way (for mood lighting) so if you want them bright press twice fast. The kitchen was great and had most of what we needed (cutting boards knives crockery). All in all it is a great little apartment. 
151020,177656600,2017-08-03,111784700,M,A lovely apartment (ideal for 2 really) in a great location allowing you to walk to the Louvre a wide variety of places to eat and the RER station from CDG airport. Felt really safe with 2 lone females travelling; in fact everyone was really friendly over the 5 days we were in Paris - we were impressed at the warmth shown to us by Parisians! Both Cedric & Mdm Herrisson were very helpful and easy to contact.
30946994,534960735,2019-09-23,26708805,Nick,Thomas and Olga were very hospitable and accommodating to my last minute needs. And ultimately their place has been one of the nicest comfortable and airy places I’ve stayed so far! Big recommend!

Excelente ubicación pero el edificio esta en muy mal estado (cables caños a la vista parecía en obra pero no lo estaba).
El departamento es una buhardilla el techo es bajo (10 cm arriba de la cabeza de mi marido) el baño chico y la ducha incomoda no se podía colgar la toalla porque se salia el colgador. El cuarto es chico no hay donde poner la valija no se podía abrir la ventana porque la manija estaba rota. El sillón cama del living era incómodo. La cocina estaba bien. No hay televisión
Muy mala relación entre calidad y precio. 
Vecinos ruidosos "

3450265,115872497,2016-11-27,66662998,Daniel,"The place was fantastic! An easy 10 minute stroll to the Eiffel Tower half hour walk to the Louvre.  5 minute walk to a metro station.

The apartment itself was great. There are even some great tour guides lying around including some suggestion card for excellent unguided walks through the city.

The neighborhood has some great restaurants and a grocery store if you don't feel like eating out.

10/10 would stay again!"
23012929,508699928,2019-08-13,11822047,Asad,This place is perfect in every way.  Close to the monuments metro restaurants.  I highly recommend it.

8514809,455190678,2019-05-19,197218897,Hilary,A great apartment. Perfect location to explore Montmartre and enjoy the restaurants and food shops that surround the apartment. It is on the top floor of a hotel so check in is easy (and we could drop off our bags when we arrived early). The access is by keypad and was easy and meant we didn't have to all come and go together. The apartment is attractive and with everything needed - comfortable beds plenty of towels shampoo basic kitchen equipment including pans if you want to cook. The shower/bathroom has no door just a screen (separate toilet room). No problem for us as a family. And the shower is excellent!The single beds are narrow but fine for adults and in an annex to the main room. The large windows have shutters than mean you can make the room dark for sleeping. But best of all is the balcony to watch the world passing by and the changing colours over the roof tops.

20823,305769208,2018-08-12,196705272,Keke,Siyoung is very knowledgeable and bright person. She taught us many tricks and tips and was very approachable as she’d answer any questions we had. My daughter and I were lucky enough to be the only ones on the day we went so we got to do an extra face mask before the makeup! It was nice to test out popular korean products that we had been considering purchasing previously through this. Additionally Siyoung was even generous enough to give us two gifts for her 1 year anniversary of this experience! Overall Siyoung made this experience very fun and we thank her for her generosity!
21815093,539818754,2019-10-02,82094102,Michelle,The apartment was absolutely perfect for our short visit to Paris.  Within walking distance of all the sights and yet so peaceful and comfortable to retreat to at night.  Everything had been thought of for our comfort - why stay in a hotel?
761399,46374894,2015-09-10,12994956,Sabien,De buurt is fantastisch evenals het appartement. Wij logeerden met collega's hiervoor is het appartement minder geschikt in verband met privacy die er minder was doordat er maar 1 slaapkamer aanwezig is. De verhuurder was behulpzaam en vertrouwde zijn mooie appartement aan ons toe. 
1528100,310855906,2018-08-20,198556359,Audrey,James est un hôte très accueillant et disponible. Toutefois la chambre est minuscule le canapé lit est très inconfortable et le wifi ne fonctionne pas vraiment. L'emplacement est bien dans l'etoile près de champs elysé.
18480989,544402717,2019-10-10,250934910,Gry,The appartement is nice with a wonderful view and it has a nice and practical location near the gare du nord. The area is quiet and feels safe.  The appartement looks very much like the pictures in the ad. Flavien is a wonderful host very friendly and helpful! We were a familie of 5 and would definitely stay there again!
1632615,160198497,2017-06-13,29236193,Sara,Unbelievable views! We loved staying at Martin's place and looking at the Eiffel Tower every morning while we ate breakfast on the balcony. Fantastic neighbourhood to stay in while visiting Paris. Not touristy and close to the metro to get anywhere. Definitely recommend staying here!
772556,353999451,2018-11-30,114556437,Minjoo,"사진에서보는거랑 다르지않아요 유럽의 여느 숙소에 비하면 넓은편이고 라디에이터가 작동 잘해서 춥지않았어요. 무엇보다 엄마랑 가는 여행이라 엘리베이터가 있는곳을 찾았는데 정말 편했어요. 메트로도 두세군데정도 걸어서 다닐만한 위치에 있구요 호스트가 친절하고 메세지로 뭔가 문의했을때 빠르게 알려줘서 감사했어요. 
단점이라면 화장실과 샤워실이 멀찍이 떨어져있다는것과 가장 안좋았던점은 저희가 소파베드를 이용하려고 펼쳤는데 먼지가 꽤 많았어요 마치 누가 며칠내내쓰고 안치운것처럼.."
6962632,476019239,2019-06-25,3426754,Mosi,A gem tucked in the Latin Quarter. Walkability and the necessities within easy reach. Coralie’s abode is cozy and she is a super-gracious host. Highly recommended.

11908897,136208425,2017-03-09,19161450,Consuelo,Wonderful stay at this jewel in a wonderfully central location in Paris. The apartment is well decorated recently refurbished and has all you may need in a quiet building with elevator (rarity in central Paris) - the pictures are accurate. I am a regular at this apartment as I really love this place and find the hosts easy to communicate with and really very accommodating about check-in and check-out. Looking forward to coming back! 
22184834,443652721,2019-04-26,59447004,Maricah,Great location and a cute studio ample for two. Quick communication with Clémence & Etienne. A bit lacking in soundproofing but it was peace and quiet after 10pm. Highly recommend Clémence’s place if you want to be near the Trocadéro with the best view of the Eiffel Tower Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysées. Close proximity to restaurants a Monoprix and transportation. It’s a convenient 5-min walk to a taxi stand since we needed an early morning ride to the airport.
31053634,536144372,2019-09-26,171209915,Aisha,Pierre’s place is beautiful convenient safe and clean. The two of us stayed for four nights. Check in was super easy Pierre responses within minutes each time I had a query. 100/10 would stay again (:
1241291,51630025,2015-10-22,26198118,Szilvia,We liked this place! Small but very nice and friendly. We come to visit Paris and it was perfect for sleeping :) and Steven was helpful and kind. We can offer :)  
2884300,269932296,2018-05-28,22444284,Erik,"The apartment is located right in the city center in a cosy street with basically everything you need. There's cafe's for breakfast or lunch supermarket right beneath the house and plenty of bakery's around. It's a short walk to Les Halles or Grand Boulevard everything is at walking distance and otherwise you could take the subway. 

The apartment itself is what I'd call Parisian there's a courtyard flowers in the windows nice wooden floor. It's fairly spacious not huge. Compared to my Amsterdam apartment it's about the same I think.  Marianne was very welcoming and contact with her was good! Everything was a bit above expectation actually she likes the little details. I loved our stay there and I would recommend it to anyone!"
36990923,542213626,2019-10-06,196701584,Ryan,We stayed here (family of 5) and the place was great. Very clean and comfortable and quiet at night. The hosts were very helpful and responsive. We would definitely stay here again
31108066,486963336,2019-07-13,56639958,Stephanie,"The apartment is really lovely and clean inside enough space for 6 of us (2 on a fold out couch in the lounge which was very comfy). 
Louis sent a huge message before we arrived with lots of information about the flat and how to get in (which was very simple thanks to his instructions). He also gave us lots of ideas for what to see and where to check out nearby. We tried one of his food recommendations and absolutely loved it! The apartment is in a nice area with lots to see nearby. Only 15 minutes walk from the Notre Dame so handy for exploring Paris."
14311625,245926465,2018-03-24,10803696,Kathrin,Great host lovely apartment great view nice balcony. Bed was small but comfortable very calm and clean place. Directly at the bus station and good connections to the hot spots.  Would definitely stay there again!

Au plaisir."
12062485,81315296,2016-06-22,38062231,Jennifer,Very clean and nice apartment. Around 20mins walk to effiel tower. The real place is way more better than the pictures. We were very glad that we had chosen it. Will definitely stay here again for the next Paris trip. 
6525629,84731934,2016-07-08,24210914,Honor,We felt incredibly welcome!! Our expectations re the listing were exceeded! The neighbourhood felt safe secure and was super close to the metro. Marine and her son were so sweet and the flat was gorgeous.

34378599,546942753,2019-10-14,260028207,Mar,El alojamiento en casa de Karen ha sido extraordinario. Tanto el inmueble como los servicios y comunicaciones han sido superiores a lo esperado. Karen nos facilitó todo lo necesario y tuvo detalles como dejarnos productos típicos franceses para nuestra llegada. Inmejorable y muy recomendable.
2200568,17468867,2014-08-12,18911716,Aurélien,Logement identique a la description! Tres joli studio avec une situation sur Paris exceptionnelle. Décoré avec soin et beaucoup de charme nous avons Aimé mon épouse moi même séjourner comme a la maison! Bref une belle expérience. A notre départ nous n'avons pu placer le linge a l'endroit indiqué mais tout s'est très bien déroulé je recommande! Et merci pierre pour ta disponibilité et ton Acceuil!

7292414,38564869,2015-07-16,25582856,Célestine,"Nous avons séjourné une nuit avec une amie dans l'appartement de David.
Le logement était agréable propre simple et fonctionnel nous y avons trouvé tout ce dont nous avions besoin sachant que nous avons bien sur préfèré visiter la ville plutôt que de rester enfermées à l'intérieur. De plus l'appartement est bien situé non loin de la gare de Lyon et à deux pas de lignes de bus et de métro permettant d'accéder aux quartiers intéressants de Paris.
Par ailleurs David est un hôte très sympathique arrangeant disponible et prévenant. Il m'a gentiment accueilli avec des croissants et a été immédiatement joignable lorsque nous nous sommes retrouvées en bas en ayant oublié le code de l'appartement...
Bref ce court séjour à Paris a été rendu encore plus agréable grâce à ce logement et à notre hôte. Encore merci!"
11564860,134160869,2017-02-26,34761133,Eugenio,Nice place in a very good location. The flat itself is nice good bed and had everything you need when cooking. The only thing is the apartment building could use a little touching up. Carolina and Yohan are very helpful and they were always available for questions. 
20893377,205492588,2017-10-22,43502154,Michael,An amazing apartment I would definitely recommend it
2422563,252556801,2018-04-11,56300151,Almudena,Gracias a Nicolas y Aicha por su hospitalidad y atención en todo momento. La localización del apartamento es inmejorable el metro está a 100m el barrio es tranquilo tiene sitios cerca para comer y desayunar en frente hay una panadería-cafetería espectacular a 2 min. andando hay un supermercado de dos plantas. Si vas con niños hay un tiovivo al lado del metro y un parque a 5 min (Monceau) con columpios y zonas verdes. El apartamento por dentro está muy equipado echamos de menos la cafetera y el microhondas pero Aicha nos enseñó cómo hacen ellos el café y sale muy rico y al final calentamos las cosas en cazos en la vitrocerámica. Como contrapunto tiene lavavajillas y lavadora que además funcionan muy bien. El detalle de las zapatillas de andar por casa es de agradecer y la calefacción funciona muy bien. La ciudad nos ha enamorado desde luego volveremos sin dudarlo y repetiremos en el apartamento de Nicolas. La única pega que le ponemos a la ciudad es que son muy pocas las estaciones de metro con ascensor así que si vas con un carrito de bebé tendrás que ir cargando con él escaleras arriba y abajo. Un abrazo enorme para Nicolas y Aicha cuidaros mucho y volveremos en cuanto podamos.
1812535,28799299,2015-03-30,7630547,Joel,The apartment was perfectly located clean big and perfect for our stay. I would recommend it again.

23556085,345551814,2018-11-05,218186037,Nadira,Great location with lots of great restaurants and cafes around metro and bus only 2 min walking. Beautiful clean room. We received an unexpected upgrade on the room when we checked in which was very nice.  Breakfast is good too! We really enjoyed our stay definitely recommend it and we will be back!

13054899,191325093,2017-09-07,69790952,Sara,Apartment was clean and centrally located near public transportation.  Bed was more comfortable than it appeared.  Kitchen and bathroom were great.  You may need a few additional things if you are planning on cooking meals as sharp knives and some cleaning supplies were not included.  Overall a great stay.
22331599,292557819,2018-07-18,133849979,Karianne,Fanny’s apartment was in a wonderful location one street away from a lot of cute restaurants and cafes but out of reach from all the city noise. Also very close to a metro stop. Despite a bit of a miscommunication problem when checking in (which was no ones fault) Fanny was very kind to help us figure it out. The space is probably best suited for one person or two people who are good at making very little noise and stepping lightly as the apartment complex itself highly values their peace and quiet.
20161663,265177948,2018-05-16,23141112,Nicholas,"The communication was speedy and plenty of info regarding our stay at Marcy's apartment.
The location is really close to Gare de L'est which was very convenient and a great place to base yourself.
The area is really nice to stroll around. The walk along the canal offers up some cool art work graffiti on display some nice little shops and some delightful restaurants all within walking distance.
Within a 7 minute walk you will find the most amazing boulangerie known as the Du Pains et Des Idées.
The apartment is cute and has everything you need. It's in a very quiet area so you'll get away from the noise for a goods night rest.
If we were to stay in Paris again we would stay with Marcy again for sure."
3371766,84499286,2016-07-07,35999939,Nha-An,"We enjoyed our stay and greatly recommend this apartment and its owner Vu. 

The cozy apartment is in the heart of Le Marais and within walking distance to shops restaurants bakeries metro station (Saint Paul line 1) and Notre Dame Cathedral (Saint Michel). The apartment is nicely decorated with a queen bed in a hide-away upper floor a sofa bed a fridge/stove and it is well lit with sun light during the summer. 

Vu is friendly caring and knowledgeable. He greeted us at the apartment and gave us a walking tour of the area. He asked us for our interests and kindly offered recommendations/suggestions. His recommendations/suggestions saved us time and made us feel welcome acquainted and definitely excited for our tranquil sojourn in the area. If you are ever struggling to create a daily itinerary for your trip around Paris fear not. Vu provides several travel guides to ensure you have the best experience possible. 

In terms of the apartment itself we did not experience any difficulties. Clearly the apartment was well-maintained. In all we could not have asked for a better stay in this apartment."

Cons: You have to go up 6 flights of stairs since there is no elevator (but Gam was nice enough to help me with the bags). The space was smaller than I expected but it was fine for 2 people for a short stay."

It is truly a special place to return to with its lovely terrace comfortable rooms and kitchen after long days spent exploring the city and observing the beautiful pageantry of Paris.

22578045,433875438,2019-04-07,32841992,Cas,I absolutely loved staying at Christine's delightful apartment.  The room was lovely and peaceful and I although Christine was out of town when I arrived she arranged for a neighbour to let me in and show me around.  I had mentioned needing to use the kitchen to make my tea (-I have an Earl Grey addiction) and Christine had very thoughtfully left me a batch of organic teas in the room.  A lovely welcome!  I very much enjoyed our little chats around a beautiful circular wooden table in her living room. She is super interesting and well travelled. I'll look forward to staying there again on my next visit!  Great value highly recommended and indeed a rare find!

3982131,325960566,2018-09-21,160686854,Renata,"Staying at Sandrine""s studio was absolutely lovely. If you are travelling alone this place is perfect. Not only because its location is nice and you have pretty much all you need within it but because Sandrine is a wonderful host. She is caring attentive and kind. Her welcome was refreshing after a few hours travelling and she promptly replied my requests later on. My Paris experience was fantastic and I thank Sandrine for assisting with that; there are not many hosts like her out there. Grateful  ❤"
16769186,299053454,2018-07-30,28492608,Rhiannon,"This is a lovely little apartment in a fantastic location - perfect for two people. There are dozens of restraints and cafes within a 5 minute walk and it’s only a few minutes from the nearest Metro stop and 15 from Notre Dame.

Clara provided loads of useful information before we arrived. Check in was quick and easy and the place was easy to find even when we arrived late at night. "
7337703,319108362,2018-09-05,52296937,Julia,Brice place was perfect it is smaller than it appears in the photos but that wasn’t a problem for me. Brice gave a detailed explanation of how to check in and warns you about no elevator and the lively neighbourhood. I feel that a lot of the previous comments stereotyped the neighbourhood when it’s actually a very nice place to stay this is my third time coming to Paris and I loved This neighbourhood. I never felt unsafe and I walked home alone at night all the time and yes there was cat calling but that happens all over Paris not just in this neighbourhood. The neighbourhood is not unsafe at all! It is very lively though but I found that enjoyable I actually felt more safe in This neighbourhood than I have in many other places in Paris. Don’t listen to the comments from the people who stereotype the neighbourhood it’s very safe with a very convenient location close to downtown and the airport and very easy check in and check out.  I would recommend this Airbnb to another solo young female traveller or to any solo traveller!

The flat and views are exactly as pictured—you can even see the top of the Eiffel Tower in the distance.

Evangeline was a great host and able to accommodate an early check in which I appreciated after the long transatlantic flight.  I will stay there again the next time I return to Paris!"

1342096,11697078,2014-04-12,12648297,Louise,"I enjoyed my stay at Caroline's apartment. The location was great- close to Montmartre and all the lovely cafés but in a quiet street away from the tourist hustle and bustle. Caroline was welcoming and also helpfully booked me a taxi to the train station when I was leaving.

Couple of things to note- the ad for this apartment says there is a TV and washing machine however the apartment does not in fact come with these items. There is also no hand soap or hairdryer provided so you will need to bring your own. Unfortunately the internet was not working very well while I was there (very slow) however I understand Caroline and her husband are working on fixing this.

Overall I would recommend staying at this apartment as it is well-priced and conveniently located however it is just worth noting the matters above. "

27624093,351875201,2018-11-24,4083132,Vero,Sweet and tiny mini-Appartement in calm neighborhood. Very good connection through Metro just right the corner. Warm welcome with tea coffee and bisquits. Everything you need is there. Clean room and bed. Only blanket is a little bit too small for tall people bed linen are loose - that's why we had some problems in arranging it. Perfect communication and organization from Marie-Justine. Recommended!
1206058,435101467,2019-04-09,94104777,Holly,We had an amazing stay at Cite Riverin. We are a family of 6 with kids ranging from 18-8 we always felt safe (even when getting home super late). It is so close to the metro food shopping and sites!  My 13 year old daughter and I walked home from Notre Dame stopping at almost every store along the way and loved every minute of it! Super clean and everything you need to feel like you are home. We loved that the building required quite hours starting at 10pm we never dealt with noisy neighbors while going to sleep.  Would recommend to everyone to stay here.
5860831,194718970,2017-09-17,8879046,Doug,Great place! Would stay again for sure.
3420646,163723309,2017-06-25,6224013,Niraj,Gem of a find. Space is a small studio but perfectly equipped for a solo traveler or couple. Bed is comfortable bathroom by other standards is large and efficient. The view is incredible and the terrace to enjoy a morning coffee or quiet meal is one of my more memorable experiences in Paris. I had a chance to meet Alice's father who was extremely friendly helpful and gave me some further insight into the area. Batignolles has quickly become one of my favorite areas in Paris charming authentic family or hip solo traveler friendly. A part of Paris not overrun with tourists. I'd recommend this place 100% and it's priced quite well.

Ci ha accolti Rafael molto gentilmente la casa è così come descritta molto spaziosa e comoda. Un po' meno il divano letto ma per due notti si può sopportare. Comunque nulla da dire. Davvero una buona esperienza.
16317805,249475020,2018-04-02,100469596,Edgar,Cynthia’s place was lovely. A great stay for a couple and close to everything. We were able to travel to all of our destinations with ease. Our uber rides were literally like 10 mins away from most attractions. The apartment is small but cozy for two. Bathroom is small as well but we didn’t mind. I would recommend Cynthia’s place to anyone. Thank you again !!

The metro is literally right there and you have the entire studio to yourself. This was huge for us because most air b n bs have you share a space with someone. If I ever visit Paris again I wouldn’t stay anywhere else! The owner Élodie was so amazing  she responded right away  organized and super kind. 
We felt very safe in the neighbourhood and had a lot of cute little restaurants near by. 10 out of 10 "

Breakfast with Gregory and Bernd is an art so refined as to be impeccable never mind healthy and nourishing. They were very sincere in helping us to navigate the city the where's and how's of Paris. The quality of the conversations we had showed their genuineness of their care to their guests and the world we live in. Impeccable hosts grateful guests and now friends. Thank you

14102478,290273206,2018-07-14,21789834,Gabi,The apartment is wonderfully located in a lovely building in Le Marais.  It's on the 4th floor so be prepared to lug your suitcases up the stairs.  We managed fine.  The apartment has lots of windows and light and was very comfortable for our family of four.  The kids were happy to each have their own room.  A great choice in a neighborhood that is central and fantastic for exploring with many food and shopping options.
2095577,57991248,2015-12-31,36337909,Megan,This flat was absolutely perfect! Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 2 nights and it was great. Everything looked exactly like it was advertised except for the view of the Eiffel Tower... which was even better that expected!! Great location and huge balcony with floor to ceiling view. We would definitely return. Plus there was a towel warmer which was a definite plus for me (: Harry also has lots of books on good places to eat drink shop etc. which was very nice.

Perfect location to explore the city (the area is very well served by public transport – metro bus and bike-sharing) very close to charming “Butte aux cailles”. The room was spacious clean and  bright with lots of natural light. Definitely recommended! 
4488115,68906361,2016-04-07,29926793,Fernanda,Jules was a great host although he couldn't come meet me he made sure his friend Nareej was there to open the door for me and welcome me.

7158715,504237637,2019-08-07,93547134,Jenifer,Ruth’s apartment in the heart of Paris was an absolutely delightful find!  It was so close to everything and we constantly received remarks about how nice it is to be located on L’le Saint Louis right next to L’le de la Cité where Notre Dame and Sainte Chappelle are located.  And it was a lovely stay.  The area was always easy to find easy to get to always shops and restaurants within walking distance and a little more quiet being on the little island in the Seine river.  The apartment was probably a bit bigger than many with a lovely large dining table a large comfotable bathroom and a restful calm master bedroom (with an attached child/baby’s bedroom).  I was worried about the heat but being able to keep the bedroom window open at night without concern for our safety made it quite cool and peaceful.  Ruth was super helpful and always amazingly fast to respond if I had any issues.  She was also very generous in helping us with a problem that occurred...she really knows how to take care of the people who rent her space.  Also her cleaner/housekeeper Joy was friendly helpful and kind and met us in the city with an extra key when we accidently locked ourselves out!  Also the architecture of the building and apartment was so interesting with exposed wood beams etc.  I think the building was built in the 1700’s which to me is a treat to be able to stay in something so historic as that!  Loved the pretty red doors on the street which led to the courtyard leading to our apartment...felt welcoming and charming and oh so classically Parisian!  It was a great stay a lovely place to be based while adventuring in the city and I’d definitely enjoy staying there again if I am back in Paris in the future!

12196813,103735811,2016-09-24,20406901,Zhongrui,Jen is a great host she really cares of about her guests we feel it once we step into the apartment. Whether you are a first-time visitor or not do take Jen's advices about staying safe in Paris and read through the materials she prepared pay attention to the pocket picker information. We had a great time in Paris (first timer) we only give the apartment 4 out of 5 stars because of something not in Jen's control. First there is no elevator in the building so if you have a small child that you have to carry up and down or have a big and heavy suitcase do consider the steep and narrow stairs to the 5th floor. To be honest we were in shock when we see the staircase only one adult can fit in it and I almost slid a few times had I not holding the handrail. Second it was the mosquitos we encountered quite a few each night and it was inconvenience to say the least. Even with this we still recommend Jen as a host.

The place is well situated a few blocks from a subway stop.  Gildas was very flexible with our check-in time and very nice when we showed up a couple hours late due to congestion at the airport.  The place has a nice renovated bathroom and kitchen.  It is spotless and quiet and the bed is super comfortable.  It was also nice and warm.  Gildas was very helpful suggesting places to visit and restaurants to try and was also helpful in giving directions and transportation guidance.

6341588,48012387,2015-09-22,6178998,Raúl,"¿Si lo que buscas es un lugar tranquilo limpio seguro agradable y con una excelente relación calidad-precio? Este es tu apartamento! 
Buscar pisoe en París puede ser difícil debido a la gran oferta y la enormidad de la ciudad. Uno está obligado a coger el metro con lo que instalarse a dos pasos de la plaza de la República un hub de metros facilita cualquier movimiento. 
Aprovecha y descubre a dos pasos el canal de Saint Martin; el barrio latino Bastille y el Marais a 20 min a pie (3 paradas de metro).
En conclusión: un excelente elección! 
Y Jean-Luc disponible atento agradable... "
37516897,507938903,2019-08-12,58647262,Eric,"Fairly priced.   Centrally located.   Close to Metro & dining.
Few hitches-had to wait 45 minutes after check in for key.
WiFi never worked
No toilet paper
Door was really hard to open/close.  Had to slam door & put shoulder into it to open
Stated it slept 3.    Very cramped.  Couch is not a pull out.  It flattened out.  Not much larger than single bed.  Difficult for 2 adults.
It was clean and host responsive."

26867700,531774059,2019-09-18,68509046,Kimberly,We booked last minute and Noemie was very accommodating. She greeted us and was able to give us tips on where to get a bite to eat. It was outside the more “touristy” area of Paris but the proximity to the Metro made travel to attractions VERY easy. Plenty of places within walking distance to have a bite to eat or a drink. Several cafes as well.
4610042,80759134,2016-06-19,3134040,Sandy And Lydia,Corinne was very helpful before we arrived with clear instructions and her fiancé let us in and showed us round the flat. It was perfect for myself sister and mum's weekend stay and a great location for getting around the city. The flat had everything we needed the bed was comfy check-out was very flexible which was helpful as our return Eurostar wasn't until the evening. They even left us bottle of red wine which was a lovely touch! Thank you for a lovely stay!
1362667,72417865,2016-05-02,35285313,Dindo,"We were part of a 5-country European tour with Paris France eventually becoming our base. Having little knowledge on the ins and outs of this city we relied on the reviews here in Airbnb and on the photos and description of the host in choosing our accommodation. 

We were not disappointed. 

Exactly as described and to our delight it was indeed a charming apartment in a very charming city. The location was superb and the neighboring establishments like cafes shops groceries etc was well within reach. You won't go wrong in choosing this place. And a bonus too if you get to meet a charming fellow in the person of Fabien like we did. We'll definitely be back.

8005682,295258484,2018-07-23,43378764,Beatriz,Apartamento muito bem localizado e de fácil acesso perto do metro e de paradas de ônibus. Próximo ao parque de Belleville e ao Buttes-Chaumont. Supermercados bares restaurantes e outras comodidades na área. O Javier foi um excelente anfitrião muito atencioso e prestativo atento a todas as comunicações. Não deixou nada a desejar recomendo 100%. 
2643308,83629921,2016-07-03,19729003,Marc,"Het appartement heeft alles wat je nodig hebt voor een paar dagen Parijs. Prima bed keukentje met koffie en thee lekkere douche. Het ligt vlakbij de Sacre Coeur en de metro is om de hoek.
Extra complimenten voor de geweldige styling! Uit het aantal losse snuisterijen en boeken in huis  spreekt een groot vertrouwen in de gasten. Dat voelt bijzonder en welkom.
Door de delf-check-in is het heel eenvoudig op een eigen te kiezen tijdstip aan te komen."

142507,292609516,2018-07-18,2442591,Elissa,This is the second time I've stayed at Martin's avenue d'Italie apartment. It has been redone since the last time I stayed (6 years ago) and looks amazing. It's an excellent location right near the Tolbiac metro stop which made it super easy to get all over the city. There is a grocery store literally right underneath the apartment and some great cafes in the area (especially closer to Place d'Italie). Plus Martin went above and beyond to get the internet/tv working in the apartment on my second day there so that I could get the work done that I needed to do when I was there. Highly recommended location and host.
6944785,39088637,2015-07-20,36737202,Oleg,Неделю жили в его квартире. Отлично что есть паркинг под машину. В Париже дорого и очень тяжело найти место под машину. Рядом две линии метро - очень удобно. Вечером на улице кипит жизнь много кафе и молодежи. Чистый и уютный дом и квартира. 
30280965,440895402,2019-04-21,243847211,Timothy,Great location and value! Elevator is a good feature being on the 5th floor but is very small so we ended up not using it except to move our bags. Also this was a great size for our young family of 4 but there are lots of steps and bed is low to the floor so could be a challenge for those who have mobility difficulties. There is only a bathtub not a stand up shower. It has a hose with a sprayer so it suffices. The kitchen is tiny but has the basic essentials - fridge microwave dishes etc. No aircon but 3 Windows that can be opened to let in fresh air. Close to some key tourist spots and nice cafes down the street. The area felt safe.
16737913,485125038,2019-07-10,63868295,Ollivier,Studio bien placé (proximité commerce transmets....)
878992,7091978,2013-09-06,2672636,Jennifer,It doesn't get better than this apartment. Vinciane was very helpful when we arrived and gave us a spare key and packet of helpful Paris tips for the neighborhood. Plenty of great shops cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Full grocery store cheese shop foie gras store within a few blocks. Had friends over before dinner one night and they were so jealous of our cool apartment with a bar setup in it. The perfect place to stay. Oh great shower and comfortable bed too! We hope to stay here again someday.
17132314,247119197,2018-03-27,8347791,Kathryn,This apartment was exactly as described my husband and I absolutely loved staying here.  The host and his wife were extremely helpful with suggestions on where to eat and visit which was great because with the itinerary we made we were able to add things on and choose some spots we didn't know about!  The apartment was in a great location we were able to walk to just about every major spot we wanted there are 2 metro stops nearby as well (we walked and took public transit other than to the airport).  We were able to see everything we wanted to see and there are tons of wonderful restaurants within 10-15 minutes walking distance which is perfect because when you walk home at night you pass so many beautiful things (we were able to walk to the Eiffel Tower in 15 minutes)!  We were out all day long about 9AM-10PM touring around and trying different restaurants so this apartment was perfect for us.  The apartment is in a very safe neighborhood we didn't experience any issues.  If you're looking to stay in the city this is the perfect place to stay to get the Paris experience and check everything off your list!
2949552,33998782,2015-06-03,15045685,Alan,"Terri and I found Anne-Marie's apartment to match the description - a perfect setting for our six days in Paris.  The apartment was located in Saint Germain neighborhood that provided easy access to local restaurants and stores.  

The apartment was close to metro and taxi transportation with easy access to Paris locales.

Anne-Marie and Laurent her son were very attentive.  The apartment was well-organized with maps restaurant recommendations and other amenities that allowed us to quickly settle into the home.

We enjoyed our stay and would use their apartment when visiting Paris."
497821,261792517,2018-05-07,83441902,Andrei,"The location and the view from the apartment are wonderful you are within walking distance of everything you need.
However the apartment itself is in a much worse state than the photos show.
The wallpaper is stapled to the wall unfortunately there is a lot of dust everywhere. We found the linens pretty bad and the sofa is very bad for sleeping. The whole apartment simply needs renovation and has needed it for a decade at least. It is an OK place to stay for 2 people unless the sofa is changed.
The hosts are nice people and the check-in was easy and pleasant."
24366159,266554271,2018-05-20,3142546,Katie,Charles' place is beautiful and spacious!! A must stay!! He and his team are so responsive and conscientious :) We will definitely be back again :)

Has everything you need: privacy large bathroom located in quiet and affluent neighborhood central location for sightseeing. We really enjoyed the balcony that overlooked all the beautiful Parisian buildings and tree lined streets. Will definitely book this again on our next Parisian adventure!

24728676,472247128,2019-06-19,161326183,Jacob,Pierre-Jean was an excellent host. He was welcoming kind and spoke great english. He was very quick to respond when we had to book his place on such a short notice. His place has the best view of Paris - much better than I imagined it could've been. It is also very spacious and beautiful. I was able to wash my clothes which is a total plus. I definitely recommend staying here.

The apartment is great spacious and bright. Note it is on the fifth floor (stairs). Easy acces to the metro and everything you might need nearby. Indeed amazing view of Sacre Coeur :-)"

34594486,478685694,2019-06-30,140768875,Nathan,"NO HOT WATER ONE WORKING POWER OUTLET! 

WIFI turns off with the lightswitch you might even have to plug it in! (black box by the only working power outlet)

When we stayed it was a dangerous place to stay shorted wires fire hazard! Ask to see an inspection certificate from a licensed inspector before renting this unit! And if you don't just don't plug anything in to the kitchen outlet by the door!

No hot water moldy coffee maker no working microwave and a shorted circuit in the kitchen.

The towel dryer didn't work and the bathroom smelled of mold

The other dryer is a typical European hang dryer with no ventilation fan so you can't load it with a full laundry load or your laundry sours.

Do half loads and you should be fine!


We visited during a heat wave and we asked for a fan. He didn't tell us where to get one and said ""I can't control the weather!""

It was a real parisian experience! 
Rent from here if you want to walk 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to get your key from a lockbox in a laundromat! 

And he expects you to return it there too.

I hope you get there while it's open!

Some other highlights from our stay included:  

The wifi turning off when you turn the lightswitch off.

No soap or shampoo or hygine kit as advertised.

But on a positive note:

If you leaned out the window you could see the Eiffel tower. 

And

 It was a fairly close walk to the Eiffel tower so you can see more tha

Protip: At night every hour on the hour for 5 minutes it sparkles. If you go down the street to Cafe Michel and sit at the table to the right  of the door you can enjoy your wine  and escargots and STEAK (not the raw tartare but good cooked steak!) And you have a view of the top of the sparkling tower on the hour!"
8003633,239084714,2018-02-28,25303645,Robert,A beautiful little space in a modern building a fantastic bathroom and a lovely usable if small kitchen. The street it is on is a humdrum Hausmann boulevard but at Oberkampf around the corner there are plenty of old style butchers hip cafes and so on: this is a lively welcoming hip and not wealthy or touristy part of Paris. A large open air market meets several times a week a few blocks away.
5439984,112506392,2016-11-06,40290069,Liuqi,Jean and Erick are very nice people very helpful and informative. They are easy to talk to and our communications went quite well. The apartment is located close to the metro. Even though I didn't stay there for long it was a pleasant stay.

However we found unusual some leftovers in the fridge and in the kitchen in general. The apartment is not the cheapest and therefor we expected higher quality conditions. There is a cleaning fee and we think that the apartment could have been more properly clean and in terms of arrangements for clothes and space in general"

Some nuances... Kitchen is not equipped as I would like to. It looks like it was created not for cooking... No coffeemaker no spices etc. If you eat just in restaurants that ll suit you perfectly. 
No hairdrier. I didn’t see the information that the apartment has no hairdrier and it was for me unpredictable(((( but it’s my mistake. 
I really liked the apartment itself. Great location! Benjamin was very friendly!
I would recommend this apartment!!!"

Die Wohnung ist gleichermaßen modern wie gemütlich eingerichtet und liegt zentral in Paris. Die Fotos geben einen guten Eindruck von der Umgebung und Einrichtung. An den Geräuschpegel in den Straßen muss man sich sicherlich gewöhnen Paris ist schließlich eine pulsierende Metropole.  Unsere Gastgeberin Mathilde ist sehr aufmerksam sämtliche Fragen konnten schnell geklärt werden. Als wir ankamen war sofort jemand da der uns empfing und uns alles gezeigt hat. Alles in allem ein sehr schöner Aufenthalt. Die Wohnung liegt sehr zentral mit den üblichen Verkehrsmittel (Metro Fahrrad) lassen sich die meisten Ziele in kurzer Zeit erreichen. Ideal für ein Touristikprogramm in der Stadt. Wir würden die Wohnung jederzeit wieder mieten wenn wir einen Besuch in Paris planen. Vielen Dank!

She helped me lug a 50-pound suitcase up six flights of stairs.  She bought me coffee when I arrived and she was totally available by phone during my visit.  She also told me that the room was mine to do with as I liked while I was there.  Love!

I will say that the room is *wee*--certainly just for one person--and that there's no elevator.  So look at those details carefully.  That said ...

I loved the room!  I want to live there!  It had everything I needed and was totally comfortable and the location is out of this world fantastic.  It's a two minute walk to all sorts of cafes bars markets tabacs and metro stops.  I can't remember anymore why I live in a house. The refrigerator sink microwave stove kettle and washing machine worked perfectly.  Bed was comfortable.  Everything was spotless.  And Aurelia has stocked everything I needed for my stay.  Hurrah!

26562,55052406,2015-11-27,49198659,David,"We were absolutely delighted with our choice of this beautiful apartment. My wife and I know Paris and this quartier quite well and looked at all the options very carefully. We feel that we made absolutely the right choice. The apartment itself is lovely comfortable and well-equipped exactly as in the listing description. Judith was the perfect host. She was there to greet us when we arrived even though we were a little behind schedule because of traffic disruption. She had thoughtfully provided the immediate essentials (milk juices pastries etc) to save us shopping in the evening. She took us through the various details (wifi etc) and left comprehensive guides on the immediate local area and what to do in Paris. She was available to contact during our stay though as everything worked perfectly we had no need to do so. We really did feel guests in her home as indeed we were rather than clients in an impersonal apartment. The quartier itself is a perfect base for exploring Paris. There are excellent local restaurants and brasseries a great local market on Wednesdays and Sundays and excellent metro and bus links (the closest metro is Dupleix but La Motte-Picquet Grenelle a short walk away is also at the intersection of 3 metro lines). So you have both a great local area with real character and quick and easy links to everything Paris has to offer. All in all - perfect. If you are looking for a base for a few days or longer in Paris you need look no further. This is definitely the place to stay!!

3477049,509857564,2019-08-15,64556829,Traci Marie,I think this apartment has amazing potential yet lacks a home-away-from-home feeling which I think AirBnB customers expect. Several of the light fixtures were out basic amenities were either old stale or unavailable (eg. toilet paper spices curtains for privacy front entrance/hall lighting). The view from the balcony was spectacular and made up for the six flights of stairs. I feel that with a little upkeep and slight remodeling this place could be a perfect getaway for AirBnB travelers. Thank you !
4196838,21533278,2014-10-19,3751003,Maria,We loved Laurence's apartment! We stayed here 10 days and not only was it adorable and perfectly comfortable it had all the amenties you could want.  Do not be put off by the lack of reviews we were one of her first and we found the apartment to be even better than described and pictured.  Laurence was warm friendly accessible and responsive.  We were lucky enough to be able to rent it on short notice.  Also the neighborhood is great and lively with bar/restaurants downstairs and across the street (but never too noisy).  Also just downstairs is a small grocery store a wine shop and a cleaners where we were able to pop in and have a shirt pressed for a couple of euros while we waited! Close to the metro close to the Marais close to the Bastille's amazing farmers' market (the kitchen is perfectly equipped for cooking which we did a bit of almost every day) the apartment is situated in a wonderful area and near fantastic restaurants.  Oh and with our heavy suitcases we were really happy the apartment was only 1 flight of stairs up.  We would definitely stay here again - and hope to often!

The place was clean and everything was working as expected. Check-in was smooth and communication was great. Only downside would be that the mattress is a little on the soft side but I was ok with that.
Very good value for money!"

También tiene a unas cuadras una estación de metro lo cual te permite trasladarse a otros puntos más lejanos. La experiencia en la casa de  Lili fue buena: la casa esta bonita cómoda y ella fue muy amable en los 4 días que estuve ahí.

It was clean cute and had a little shiny balcony. Inger was very helpful and very lovely. Definitely would want to stay at this apartment again.

The space is also really nice and it's big for Paris.  The unit was well-supplied making our stay easy.  Our family of three was very comfortable there.  Our hosts were responsive and helpful as well.   We would definitely stay there again.

El departamento tiene muy buena ubicación y el barrio es lindo y tranquilo. La habitación es pequeña; para una persona está bien. Son 6 pisos  ya sin ascensor para mi no fue un impedimento pero hay que tenerlo en cuenta.

15346338,125530724,2017-01-06,15387211,François,Logement propre et fonctionnel. Petit conseil : bien anticiper la présence de l'hôte dans le studio ou pas le logement n'étant pas très grand. A part ça Emre est très sympathique et avenant aucun soucis de ce point de vue là. 
15816959,163620714,2017-06-25,6244210,Laura,The apartment was bright and airy and very comfortable with a well-equipped kitchen and washing machine and everything you need to feel right at home! It's up on a high floor with a lovely view over the neighborhood in the heart of Chinatown and very convenient to the metro and trams. The only downside was that the street can be a bit noisy if you need to have windows open (as we did given the heat wave) but that wasn't too much of an issue. Stéphanie was a lovely communicative host who was very accommodating when we arrived early with lots of luggage. I would definitely recommend her place!
9266585,159473183,2017-06-11,114575459,Becca,The location was amazing! We could easily access multiple metro lines making the trip to almost anywhere easy! The noise from the bars below is loud but by using the fan we were able to cancel out the noise. Just FYI the shower is glass and in the middle of the room so there is little privacy within room itself.

I recommend this room."
8594324,289895976,2018-07-13,152113363,Patrick,Close enough to everything but not where all the tourists are. That’s what we were looking for and it was perfect. Canal has a great urban vibe. Short walk to metro. Yue ‘s local recommendations were great. Apartment is very clean and nicely appointed. Bed was comfy and bath and kitchen are updated.

1926698,10437800,2014-02-18,7602732,Anna,"I booked Regine's flat for a long weekend in Paris mid-Feb with my mum for her birthday. Coming in from Gare du Nord (Eurostar) the location was really easy and around 15 euros by taxi or a few stops on the metro. It was a relief to see a lift so we could easily access the flat with our luggage. 
The flat is everything it says in the description - and tidy clean minimalist. The 'room with a view' (living room) was lovely as it backs on to a large courtyard with a huge graffiti mural painted across the wall - I loved this! Another luxury was access to a nice bath with unlimited hot water. Walking to Isle St Louis was about 25 mins and en route there are so many lovely shops restaurants nearby. We found one 'Café Charlot' on the last night which was kind of French Brasserie meets New York meets Paris again! Serves food all day and great quality/atmosphere.  
Would highly recommend Regine's flat for location and comfort.

7364642,122859900,2016-12-26,23056583,Adel,Nous avons passé ma femme & moi prés d'une semaine chez Marianne. A notre arrivé elle était sur place pour nous accueillir on a discuté quelques petites minutes car elle avait un train a prendre. L'appartement était exactement comme décrit sur sa page voir mieux; très propre calme équipé ...etc. A moins de deux minutes de marche de la station République. A coté il y a tout (Brasseries Boulangeries Théâtres etc). Pour notre départ la Belle Marianne a été très arrangeante Comme nous avions un vol de nuit elle nous a largement laissé le temps de profiter de la journée et de préparer nos affaires. Que dire ? A recommander absolument !
12845423,507932384,2019-08-12,6220900,Gabrielle,Loved staying here the area is fantastic. Close to the Metro easy walk to the Seine. Bonus to have a dining area too. Communication was great and I hope to return soon!
1180022,189560269,2017-09-02,43598652,Jen,Claudia's place was in a great location. There were tons of restaurants stores etc within walking distance. I felt very safe during my stay there. Claudia was on vacation during my stay but arranged for someone else to let us in. She was quick to respond to messages and gave us very accurate instructions on how to get to her place from the airport.

Nazeem was very helpful and accomodating by letting us have early check-in when we arrived. Only downside is it is a bit noisy but that is to be expected in such a central location. Would recommend this apartment.

24225215,468293833,2019-06-12,22439738,Dick,Marie and Louis were great hosts.  They were very concerned that all went well and responded quickly to issues that came up.  The location was great close to shops restaurants grocery metro and attractions. The apartment was very clean when we arrived and nicely decorated. There were a couple of sex shops close in case you have concerns about little children.  We had 12 stay there and the bathroom facilities were insufficient for that many.  There were 2 toilets and 2 showers so there was a lot of waiting.

The mattress was a bit thinner and harder than we're used to but it was not a big deal - we got used to it. The location isn't exactly in the city center but with the Metro being a short walk away that was not an issue for us. 

There are also many grocery stores bakeries restaurants and cafés nearby so finding something affordable to eat was never an issue. 

We had a great time and would absolutely recommend Nathalie's place to anyone who is interested in thoroughly exploring and experiencing Paris like a local at an affordable price."

314294,410037191,2019-02-09,95302,Elizabeth,"Perfect Petite studio in a great neighborhood !  The nearby marchés dozens of restaurants boutiques and proximity to multiple metro and bus lines makes this THE premiere neighborhood in Paris.   Being on the ground floor was helpful as most airbnb's are on upper levels many without elevators.  Three security doors between the street and the studio door creates safety.

Carole's kind attention and the generous gift of spending time with us upon arrival and before departure was the best thing !   I wish all Airbnb hosts took the time to chat.  

The apartment was very sweet.  Exactly as pictured- petite and cozy.  Very warm and dark great for sleeping.   No street noise; only noise was in late evening from neighbors upstairs and in courtyard from other residents in the apartment building passing by occasionally.  

Plentiful towels and thoughtful coiffure tools and toiletries are provided.  Facial tissues TP and paper towels - all!  (this was the only time in France staying in 5 different airbnb's that all these were provided.  Thank you Carole!  It made such a difference.)   Large shower with plentiful hot water great water pressure and adjustable height shower sprayer that accommodates very tall folks. 

Bed mattress is getting ready for a change as it felt to me like a very very firm futon.  I do have an achey body so I do better with a softer more plush mattress and yet I know this isn’t true for everyone. 

The ""couch"" is basically a day-bed and I couldn't imagine having a third person in this small space with suitcases etc.  But ""on fait ce qui l'on doit!""  

Tiny kitchenette does have cooktop microwave small fridge and a great selection of cookware and implements and dishes and glassware.   (no oven)  Due to the tiny space we couldn't imagine cooking a real meal but I'm sure it has been done!  Coffee maker was a Nestle Dolce Gusto and Carole kindly provided coffee pods to use as well as a nice selection of teas.  Table and chairs exactly as pictured.  

I would love to return here.  I hope Carole is able to continue being an Airbnb hostess - she helps make the world a better and kinder place.   

Bon Voyage!"

18745056,216740385,2017-12-05,7421626,Jessica,"Beautiful apartment in a great location. 
Expect no service and no amenities.
Host does not provide a manual for the home and even the most basic of supplies. Example: no toilet paper no wine opener (in Paris). 
Also for an apartment with 3 bedrooms only 1 key was provided."
33632258,472642409,2019-06-20,6171303,Jennie,I am in Paris for a production shoot and we needed an affordable location last minute to shoot some interviews. I found Benoit’s place and he was very responsive when I reached out - we went for 4 hours and had a wonderful experience at his place. He was present the whole time and allowed us to carefully rearrange his furniture and get the exact shots we needed. If you’re shooting in Paris and need a beautiful apartment location definitely book this place!
37769171,548201360,2019-10-17,253058238,Andrew,Matthieu’s place was great in an awesome location and exactly as described. Matthieu went the extra mile by always being available and responding very quickly to any questions or tips on the local area. I would recommend his place to anybody looking for a nice spot in a central location
1866733,70545731,2016-04-18,17618387,Andrea,Eva's home was absolutely perfect. The location was great - so many wonderful shops and cafes. A short distance to the Isle St. Louis and several great museums. So much charm and love put into her place. I can't recommend it enough! 
24109403,476004624,2019-06-25,49687808,Qing,Christophe’s place locates in a safe area close to tube/train station. He and his family were super hospitable as well as the lovely decorations made me feel like being at home.
8417867,80555121,2016-06-18,33384003,Debra,Wonderful place to stay.  Apartment was clean and there was plenty of room.  The beds were oh-so comfy it was difficult to get out of them!  It was wonderful to meet and speak with Marine she was very helpful and sweet.    I would definitely stay here again.
4774663,159939887,2017-06-12,8230346,Peter,"This is a nice apartment in a fabulous location with shops bars restaurants and the River Seine within a few steps. This was our second visit to this apartment and we will very happily book it again.
Well equipped with a refrigerator microwave hob television and wifi. Nice big bed good size bathroom and a very good shower. The small balcony allows you to sit out and have lunch or dinner and has views to Notre Dame cathedral.
Communication with the owner was excellent and when we arrived we were shown around and told how everything worked. All in all a great place for a Paris city break."
7754544,332468580,2018-10-05,33974716,Stéphanie,Charmant studio où on se sent comme chez soi très bien situé (proche du métro des commerces). Super accueil et réactivité d'Hakim. Je recommande

The location is perfect not touristy local close to everything by train or walking. Many suggestions from the hosts for places to go. The bed is comfortable. I didnt want to leave the room it was so pleasant!

9500785,314097191,2018-08-26,114725978,Alexandre,"Let's get the good things out of the way first. 

- The location is awesome - right next to the city hall / Hotel de Ville restaurants bakeries and all Paris has to offer. 
- Our concierge Dorssaf was amazingly solicit and promptly provided us with everything we needed to make our stay a good experience. 
- The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need - oven hob microwave fridge with freezer and all cutlery and dishes you'd expect to find in a real home.

But...

In one of the toilets was a feces stained bathroom carpet (which made the bathroom smelly as well) - totally poor job by their cleaning team. 

The lights in the living room weren't working properly we had to turn on every lamp in the room and even then it was too dark in the kitchen in the evening.

The ceiling window wasn't working so we were left with a ridiculously warm apartment. At least they provided us fans for every room (I had to ask for one extra - which they provided promptly albeit barely functioning - two were already there).

The wooden planks covering the heating radiators were loose in the living room and almost fell on the feet of my 13 year old when he was taking stuff he had put there.

The bathroom in the ""master suite"" smells really bad - seems they forgot to install a drain trap when doing the plumbing - can't say I enjoyed sleeping while inhaling sewer gas. The shades on the  ""window"" to the living room from both bedrooms were broken to the point you couldn't properly close or open them.

The sofa bed was NOT the one in the pictures albeit not worse just different.

The chairs for the living room table are horrible to sit on - they are basically wire rack with no cushions provided.

All in all it seems someone sought to make a quick buck out of converting the building's patio into a rental apartment. That's fine but it's all very poorly done you can see that all expense was spared when doing the cupboards and woodwork as well as the tiling work in the bathrooms - speaking of which 2 bathrooms but only 1 toilet bowl.... 

Anyway our stay was okay it's definitely an acceptable apartment at a great location - but we felt misled by the pictures weren't happy with the cleanliness and disappointed by the decay of the existing installations.

The location is perfect for walking or grabbing public transit - with extra suggestions and tips provided by Philippe. He had the apartment in very clean shape and was extremely responsive and accommodating throughout our trip.
26808328,515738374,2019-08-23,139137320,Vanessa,"This is a great place for you if you want to be around all the trendy shops without being in the heart of all of the tourist areas. If you are especially wanting a bit of a night life this place is perfect for you. If you don’t want that you may have a bit of an issue as there are bars below that stay open very late and can be heard. 
This location is within walking distance of the metro supermarkets and everything else you might need! 
Lucie was also incredibly responsive!"
19994098,245017128,2018-03-20,46169971,Peter,"I stayed in Liza's apartment with 3 other people (my girlfriend her cousin and his girlfriend) for 6 days and 5 nights. Although the last night and day in Liza's apartment weren't planned and were absolutely dreadful (I will explain later) our time at her place was wonderful and definitely supplemented our amazing trip to Paris.

First and foremost Liza was a great host. Her hospitality communication and availability made our stay all the more better. A week prior to our arriving in Paris Liza setup a line of communication to confirm arrival time and any other questions we might have about our stay. We were easily able to navigate our way to Liza's apartment building from Charles de Gaulle with the provided instructions she had sent me before departing. 

Her apartment is a great space. Not only is it in a great location (not once did we feel like we had to hike to get somewhere throughout the city) but it was also clean and cozy. the 4 of us felt very comfortable during our stay. There was enough room for us to either pair off and keep to ourselves or hold all of us in the living  room area. Both bedrooms were spacious as well which made storage and egress seamless.

While the apartment itself is great it pales in comparison to Liza's hospitality. The day we were scheduled to leave I came down with food poisoning from something I ate the day before. The other couple had left early in the morning while me and my girlfriend's flight was in the afternoon. We ended up missing our flight due to my sickness and scrambled to find medical service. As you could imagine there's a lot to consider when your trip abroad takes an unexpected turn. One good thing we had going for us early on was Liza's understanding. Throughout all this she was quick to communicate and sympathetic to our situation. She ensured us that we could stay as long as we needed and that we'd figure everything out later. I recovered by the next day and subsequently checked out. While we definitely enjoyed our stay in her apartment we were even more appreciative of her generosity and hospitality"

13062195,427743769,2019-03-24,12377968,Alexandr,Excellent location good value for money - flat is not big but has everything you need - including all you need to cook and dishwasher. The only issue - bed is too short if you are tall person - it is a bit uncomfortable. Also not crystal clean but tolerable.
23916940,479659476,2019-07-01,246168234,Jeanne,Lovely flat filled with amenities and warm touches. Very clean and stylish. You won’t be disappointed!

15262420,238168897,2018-02-25,62892445,Lukas,Die Unterkunft ist verkehrstechnisch gut angebunden aber auch zu Fuß ist alles gut zu erreichen. Es gibt viele Läden und Restaurants in der Nähe und ein Parkhaus ist auch sehr nah gelegen. Die Schlafzimmer sind nicht sehr groß jedoch sehr gemütlich und jeweils mit einer Heizung ausgestattet. Das Badezimmer ist sehr neu die Dusche zwar etwas klein aber das ist denn wenigen Platz geschuldet. Die Toilette ist separat was vorallem bei 4 Personen ein Vorteil war. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet und beinhaltete alles nötige zum kochen kleinere Gerichte. Alles in allem ist diese Unterkunft für einem Städtetrip sehr zu empfehlen

13339121,87865196,2016-07-22,73665998,Harshal,We extremely enjoyed our stay at Ketty's studio and felt very homely there! It is a perfect place to stay for two people and specially for the art lovers. Ketty delightfully greeted us on time and kindly explained everything about the studio with patience. She provides more than everything you need in your daily life. (all types of kitchen and home appliances) The neighbourhood was very calm and peaceful. everything was easily accessible from the studio. (metro-station laundry cafes supermarkets etc.) It was a perfect stay indeed!:) Booked for the next trip!! ;)
23097352,418064131,2019-03-01,38544427,Ekaterina,The host was very friendly and welcoming. We had a little issue at our arrival but he immediately found a solution and took good care of us.  His reactivity and kindness made our stay perfect!
896123,23438247,2014-12-01,1807561,Elena,"The apartment is exactly ""a pied a terre"". Very small but perfect for few days. Wifi doesn't exist although Nicole includes in apartment details. Moreover the studio wasn't very clean it was dusty and I realized that because I'm allergic : ( 
Above all that the spot where the studio is located is perfect closer to metro and the Marais the coolest block in Paris! "

3301348,24939101,2015-01-04,23622779,Marjiya,Nous avons passé une semaine très agréable et reposante dans l'appartement. Bien aménagé bien réparti ameublement de goût avec un confort exceptionnel  au sein même de Paris. Maison calme spacieuse adapté à une famille avec deux enfants. Les nôtres ont 6 et 9 ans ce qui étaient parfait car ils étaient indépendants dans leur chambre à l'étage. La chambre des parents à un étage encore supérieur est très jolie et romantique avec salle de bain privative et sous les toits. Le seul hic c'est qu'il n'y avait pas beaucoup de rangements dans les chambres. Mais nous nous sommes arrangés. Nous recommandons fortement cet appartement car il est bien placé dans un quartier dynamique.

Edouard was very kind to guide us to his pretty apartment in Montmartre. Everything was ready when we arrived and he took care to leave us a few small messages on shelves to make us feel comfortable. His home is in Montmartre so close to everything. We took advantage of our stay to visit the surroundings.
Thanks again to Edouard for your hospitality and see you again."
19259820,296670233,2018-07-26,104202030,Mohammed Ali,Charming and cozy apartment in the heart of the Marais. Perfect Location to enjoy Paris. Communication was friendly and easy.
30249186,430984135,2019-03-31,79009801,Sophie,"The location was amazing 3 minutes to the nearest Metro and across the road was the nearest bus stop. The Louvre was just over the river about 10 minutes walk and the Eiffel Tower/Norte Dame was about a 30 minute walk. 

Hand soap shampoo and shower gel weren’t provided but there was washing up liquid. All the necessary kitchen necessities were there. Tea and coffee was provided however we had to buy our own milk.

Security was a little bit of an issue for us as we were based on the ground floor and any windows would reveal our living space - a little scary.

The door handle of the bathroom kept on falling apart which meant we couldn’t close or lock the bathroom door - this is what bought the rating down to 4 stars.

However all in all an amazing place!"
26612229,439581284,2019-04-19,232544473,Charlott,The appartment is like you can see it at the pictures. We had a very pleasant stay the communication and the welcoming were absolutely uncomplicated. I really would recommend staying in this appartment.

You can also easily walk the Av. des Champs-Élysées and Arc de Triomphe. The Louvre and other attractions were easily reached by public transportation at an extremely reasonable price. The surrounding neighborhoods offer incredible restaurants in every price range. We drove to Paris and were able to park within 400 meters of the apartment using the Zenpark app. The owners were easy to reach and ensured we had everything we needed. My family of four thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.
38871,22014670,2014-10-28,19188686,Eleni,Monica's apartment is very nice. It is very clean spacious nicely decorated and fully equipped. The kitchen has everything you may need and the bathroom is clean and modern. Monica has created a complete information folder with everything you might need to know how to use the utilities in the flat how to connect to the Wi-Fi and more. We had our 16 month daughter with us and Monica provided a cot for us (actually she had to buy a new cot for us which was so kind of her). There are so many toys in the flat and books for kids and our little girl was so happy playing with them. The building was very secure and the neighbourhood very nice and safe. Close by there are two small supermarkets bistro patisseries boulangeries as well as two metro stations. The Glaciere metro station is less than 5 minute walk away. Our stay was very comfortable and pleasant. We didn't have the chance to meet Monica because she was away but she had arranged her housekeeper to meet us in the flat and he was really nice and kind and explained everything to us. We'll definitely be contacting Monica the next time we will visit Paris.
23959665,544049975,2019-10-09,136922626,Ludmilla,Outstanding location great space super clean responsive host and fully stocked kitchen. I’ve on numerous occasions visited Paris and this is hands down the best space I’ve rented. We plan on staying here again on our next visit.
19332200,543672716,2019-10-08,3218643,Seth,My wife and I stayed in this apartment for one week on an anniversary trip to Paris.  Our goals were: see a wide variety of sites in the city get walking exercise spend one day outside of the city to see the countryside eat many different foods and experience the culture.  This apartment was a perfect base for all of these experiences.  Between all that Montmartre has to offer and quick access to a variety of metros we were able to get to many places very easily.  The apartment is close to the Sacre Coeur but out of the way of the high traffic tourist areas which we enjoyed.  A couple of cafe's at each end of the street were perfect for breakfast croissants and espresso.  The apartment was clean all the amenities we needed were present and Valérie was very responsive and helpful.  Montmartre is on a hill and there are steps to the apartment so that must fit your physically abilities.  Definitely recommend.
7272149,429899876,2019-03-29,43197106,Susan,Great place to stay in the heart of 3rd ard. Right off the Republique Metro stop making it easy transportation to everything. Grocery store right next door very convenient. Steps to many restaurants cafes and bakeries. Laundry in unit dryer right down the street for 1eu. Kitchen has all amentities. Upstairs loft may be tricky for people over 6ft. Friendly and responsive hosts. Would definitely recommend.
22744429,500377095,2019-08-02,149402689,Alexandra Crina,Such a cosy place! It looks better in reality than in the photos. The studios is perfect for a holiday in Paris located near the metro station supermarket and restaurants. Pretty close to the center of the city( aprox 10-15 min by metro). Federic is a wonderful host very helpful and responsive to our messages. Definitely recommend !
162163,356490882,2018-12-08,135757488,Dina,Nice cozy apartment that is located in a great neighborhood. Very easy to walk to attractions or jump on the Metro one block away.

18114358,484565637,2019-07-09,247484349,희진,The host Muriel was so sweet and kind and her house was big and the room that was provided was cozy and pleasant. The bathroom and toilet was very clean and the kitchen had all the utensils so it was good for cooking and storing foods. Bathroom and kitchen was shared with the host but it was not uncomfortable at all and they made us feel at home. There was about 4 markets around 3-8 from the house. And there was 3 stations near the house that was very approachable to Orsay museum Louvre museum and many other spots. Wish to come back here again ! Highly recommended!
4538227,442727507,2019-04-24,15211146,Maria,"Очень маленькая милая квартирка. Подойдет если вы планируете весь день проводить в прогулках по городу приползать домой - и падать спать :). Маленькая кухонная зона но есть все необходимое даже кофеварка. Очень тесное пространство туалетной комнаты - над унитазом скос крыши но для мансарды это нормально. Мой муж высокий - ему было не очень удобно :).
В квартире есть дополнительный обогреватель - очень пригодился в первый холодный день.
По заезду все было максимально просто и понятно. В квартире при заезде - чисто есть мыло шампунь туалетная бумага средство для мытья посуды. 
Две станции метро (две разные ветки) в 3 минутах пешком от квартиры. 
Хорошая квартира если вы хотите жить ""около Монмартра"" и не имеете особых претензий за адекватную цену.
Большое спасибо Jocelyn за быстрые ответы и гостеприимство!"
10745908,218859342,2017-12-15,156217054,Silvia,The apartment is amazing: done in very good taste with so many features that you can't mention them all. It is surprising how thoughtful this small place is set up the furniture is in excellent condition and very nice and tasteful. I especially enjoyed the Warhols. We didn't have one single thing to complaint about except the rain! Eve you are a great host and we enjoyed meeting you. Happy holidays!

13648143,438722086,2019-04-17,25278872,Filomena,This flat is very well located just 15 min walking from the Eiffel Tower and 5 min walking from the metro stop that takes you to the centre of Paris. The flat is quite small especially the sleeping room area. Furthermore the kitchen area needs some remodelling as you cannot see the numbers on the cooking plate and the cooking utensils and bathroom amenities were quite scarce.
30416756,411011613,2019-02-11,47704162,Valentin,Appartement très bien situé à proximité des commodités et des transports. Communication réactive avec William même s il je ne l ai pas croisé. Ras je recommande !
7192724,416106904,2019-02-24,106494157,Craig,"We arrived in the evening and just wanted to check-in freshen up and then go out for food as we'd had a long day. Unfortunately when we arrived (after the host didn't respond to a single (Hidden by Airbnb) message after giving us her (Hidden by Airbnb) specifically to communicate) she had been drinking and was noticeably smelling of alcohol and we found it difficult to part from her once in the apartment. 
I realise some guests might want to spend 30 minutes chatting with the host and being given a slurry of information that wasn't really useful but we did not and the conversation steered into the  personal and inappropriate which made us both very very uncomfortable.

The room was fine it was what we needed - a bed for the evening of our visit to Paris.
We decided to leave earlier than planned the next morning because we just wanted to leave and get on with our day. We couldn't find the host and there was cat poo on the kitchen floor.

I'm sure she is a lovely person but sadly the experience wasn't what we look for in a visit."

15882787,328447256,2018-09-26,1729916,Young,Surprisingly affordable place in a solid location. The place is extremely well decorated and has 2 bedrooms and a bathroom in the middle. Doors don’t close all the way between the bathrooms as a heads up.
3348065,132696871,2017-02-19,77347092,Joel,A really nice little apartment. It was very comfortable and it was great to be so close to the canal which is really lively and offers loads of great restaurants. The only let-down was the lack of wifi but otherwise we were very happy and had a lovely stay
15231965,267258198,2018-05-21,2095207,Danica,Although I was sceptical at first - there are many belongings of the tenant around...- from the first moment on I felt at ease and at home. You'll arrange easily in such a beautiful oasis in the Marais quarter of Paris. It felt like staying over at a good friend's place. Very peaceful clean and great energy - I can only recommend. Merci beaucoup de ce sejour Daphne!
9272413,192827547,2017-09-11,81679674,Amelia,Chloe is a great host I did not have the opportunity to meet her but I was happy with her attention and communication throughout messages. In my own point of view I did not feel secure and comfortable in this African-Middle East cultural neighborhood I was walking with fear. The apartment is very comfy but definitively needs a deep cleaning in order to breath fresh air! Besides those two points I was satisfy with my stay within the apartment but definitively in my next trip to Paris I won't stay in that particular neighborhood!
21847200,242165183,2018-03-11,164532852,Dimitra-Ani,Nice place for 3 person in a very good location!! Metro station direkt nearby. The Antoine is also a very nice guy definitely recommend to stay

13558212,527927938,2019-09-12,38816352,Fred,This is a cozy and comfortable flat on the 5th floor in zone 15. The bathroom is quite small but the living rooms are spacious enough for 3 people. There're kitchen tableware microwave and laundry machine in the house so it's quite convenient for travelers. A delicious bakery named Grains et Gourmandises is just near the street corner.
18552795,181605671,2017-08-13,143674804,Chloe,"Great little space in a very busy part of town. Good walking distance to bars and restaurants! 
Perfect if you just need a place to sleep!"
30393336,471850459,2019-06-18,11290105,Maggie,This apartment was perfect for our quick 2 days in Paris. Centrally located safe and beautiful. Everything we needed! Highly recommend.
4692142,28306359,2015-03-22,26344613,Edoardo,charlie is one of the kindest host I've ever met. the studio was very small but it had everything we needed. it offers a good value for money and it is a good choice if you need to stay a few days in Paris.
31230524,531338228,2019-09-17,8242480,Jonathan,Herve was very responsive and a fine host. The place was a bit of a tight fit but pleasant enough. Despite the bed being a fold out sofa both my wife and I were quite comfortable. Overall the apartment was clean and in a great location. Just minutes from the subway with access to everything.
3767161,37460981,2015-07-07,26087953,Jannah,Laurent was incredibly helpful in making sure we were comfortable/ we actually made it there. Apartment is in the perfect location; a block from 2 main metro stations. Only downsides: 6 flights of stairs are exhausting and the wifi is a pay as you go and doesn't give you much. Over-all a great stay! Thanks so much Laurent. 
8455450,53767144,2015-11-12,46137109,Jeff,Loved the loft! Layout location and amenities made for a fantastic value. Paul was a fantastic host and was very accommodating.
18150550,306254557,2018-08-12,41892967,Caline,Le séjour aurait pu être parfait si les plaques chauffantes de la cuisine fonctionnaient; ce qui a engendré un coût supplémentaire et non prévu de restauration à l'extérieur. Hormis cet imprévu le reste était parfait.
12020343,527681149,2019-09-11,71990945,Tom,"Very well appointed apartment.  Champaubert has thought of everything.  Multiple mirrors clocks power adapters provisions for the kitchen instructions on how to use all the appliances how to schedule a taxi local maps suggestions on places to eat.  Not sure any host could do more to help make the stay easier.

Champaubert went above and beyond to accommodate a last minute special request related to bedding and towels.

The location of this apartment is very good.  We walked from the apartment to the Eiffel Tower and then over to the Champs Elysees and then down to Place de la Concorde and over to Les Invalides and back to the apartment.  On another day we walked from Notre Dame back although that was a little over 30 minute walk.  Metro and RER  is within 10 minute walk.  Grocery store is 5 min walk so grabbing basic provisions was easy and the refrigerator is decent size.  

We also used Uber to get around when we felt a little lazier or the destination wasn’t as close to a metro stop.

Overall a great choice if you want to stay in the heart of Paris."
6640695,52103694,2015-10-26,1716250,Heike,"C'était un séjour parfait! Raphael nous a accueilli très gentil la communication était facile et il a repondu vite.

Le chartier est superbe beaucoup des bars des restaus et le Canal Saint-Martin juste à coté.
Merci beaucoup!"
35911213,543209772,2019-10-07,141615021,John,I recommend this stay without a doubt.  Clarisse gave me very accurate information about everything I needed.  The apartment is very clean and has everything you need.  The neighborhood is very central and has a very good transport service.  I do not hesitate to recommend it and repeat it for an upcoming trip to Paris.
3531290,206362034,2017-10-25,121393736,Daiana,Estuvimos en lo de Valerie 3 dias. El depto es como se ve en las fotos grande y hermoso. Sin duda lo que paga todo es la vista a la torre! No nos cansamos de mirarla. Valerie ha sido una gran anfitriona! En nuestro caso que hablara español nos facilito micho las cosas y le preguntábamos todo; siempre atenta y disponible para respondernos a todo. Nos servia un exquicito desayuno por las mañanas y fue atenta en todo sentido. Sin duda volveriamos a elegir el dpto si volvemos a Paris. La ubicacion es muy buena tambien caminando a unas cuadras de la Torre y cerca del metro. Gracias por todo Valerie!

32082,670292,2011-10-28,955492,Lauren,"Our host Michel was great we arrived in Paris late at night from Italy and Michel picked us up from the rail station and took us back to the apartment.   He made us feel at home explaining places we may visit and all about our local area. The apartment was cute with its very own touch of Paris close to the underground rail to visit all the tourist places and within walking distance to the city centre.  Thanks Michel for your kind hospitality  we throughly enjoyed our stay in your apartment and would love to come back one day.

3346571,49998605,2015-10-08,35269002,Parick,Emma is very nice and friendly to accept our booking and send us the house rules before our trip. Her beautiful apartment is located in a quiet Parisian residential areas of Zone 15 a Carrefour supermarket restaurants and the metro station are close. We could see the golden dome of L'Hotel des Invalides from the living room window in the evening enjoying the skylines at her nice balcony. While in this loft house we could fully relax ourselves in the comfortable environments created by Emma. The more details you find in the apartment the more you love it and like to enjoy the Parisian life!
33131121,489746415,2019-07-17,77792159,Lisa And Brice,Joseph's place is perfect for a stay in Paris!  Located in an neighborhood area with lots of shops and restaurants but also a quick ride to the main attractions of Paris.   It was clean check in was easy and we would highly recommend this space!
10805253,480599774,2019-07-03,5490011,Rachel,The apartment is a relatively good price and in a great location.  It isn't the cleanest apartment I've rented from Air B and B - for example the pillows were old and the bathroom kind of gross.  Thankfully the linens all smelled clean and the kitchen was clean.  The apartment is on a busy street and you can hear everything with the windows open - it was pretty loud especially with late night motorcycles.  We were four people so those of us on the couch in the living room had some trouble sleeping through the street noise.  There are a bunch of restaurants nearby and so the house has a lot food smells wafting in - not my favorite smell but just part of living in a city.  Overall I would stay in it again because of the location and value.
32710013,437101653,2019-04-14,27251582,Karine,Hôtel sympathique propre et très bien situé.  Un peu bruyant lorsque les voisins sont indélicats et le petit dej peut être amélioré ( choix de thés......) mais très bonne adresse pour le reste.

The flat itself was brilliant and I loved Laurent's interior design and was perfect!

The neighbourhood around the flat is amazing I'll definitely be coming back soon to take another stroll in Parc de la Villette!

780505,104595652,2016-09-27,90214583,Cristhian,Todo estuvo excelente. Pero tuvimos muchos probelmas porque no hubo internet durante los días de la estadía. Entiendo que estas cosas pasan pero el anfitrio no previó este detalle tan importante
3298297,46483644,2015-09-11,65606,Zahava,The apartment is tiny but clean and perfectly equipped. It provided me with the essentials I needed while on a work trip to Paris. This is an old building in one of the oldest neighbirhoods in Paris with its charms and the difficulties including a very narrow walk up two flights of stairs. The location is superb. If you can walk 30-75 minutes you are walking distance to pretty much any major magnificence of this city. David the owner was very acomodating and available. My main problem was the second hand smoke that came in through the window at night as it faces a back alley of a restaurant/bar. I'm very sensitive so that became a big problem for me especially during the weekend. 
16816755,326888106,2018-09-23,51167706,Melissa,El estudio es muy cómodo para dos personas y está bien equipado. Está cerca del metro y llegas al centro de Paris en media hora.

provided everything we needed and made it possible to access the flat earlier than the usual checkin time. 
Thank you Will for everything we had a great time at your place. "
10334533,75975423,2016-05-23,25690622,Daniel,"Great Host. Great Place. Arnaud was friendly flexible and helpful. He gave us clear directions for taking the train from the airport. Easy. He also had recommendations for us for our visit to Paris. And he is a very nice guy the little we got to know him. The appartment is BETTER than the description. Here's why: 1. Spotlessly clean. 2. Very comfortable bed. 3. Great shower. Lots of hot water and strong water pressure. (For my fellow Americans you can tilt the shower head up and down twist it side to side even raise and lower the height. I mention this because I've been in France 10 days before I figured it out.) 4. Arnaud supplies a welcome bottle of wine. He also shared coffee salt butter etc. so we could settle in before we had to go shopping. 5. Windows on 2 sides so lots of light and air. Plus three little (and I do mean little) balconies. No great view. Just the neighborhood but it's nice to be able to step out. Bottom Line: Very nice appartment for 2 or 1 relatively cheep with good subway access for exploring Paris. But with many charms in the neighborhood to enjoy. I moved my bottom line up because I see I gassed on and on. Keep reading if you like. The real unexpected plus to this apartment is the neighborhood. The apartment sits on a block with no cars on a street that's 2 blocks long. Tres picturesc. On the corner to the left is a plant store that displays its flowers on the street. On the corner to the right is a green grocer with fruits and vegetables on display. Also on the block is a cheese store a butcher an omlette restaurant - open only for lunch a fine food take out place a Chinese food take out place and a domino's pizza (Porquai !). The best bakery is to the right across the street 4th store on the left. Buy your fresh bagett every morning ! There are also drugstores and a supermarket within 2 blocks. If you are on a student budget there's a Paul sandwich shop where you can get a ""hero"" sandwich on a bagett for about E5.50. Or a sandwich croissant and a coffee for about E8.50. I guess it's comparable to our Subway shops except there's really no comparison. (Just a note here. If you really are a high school or college student and you want a student neighborhood this isn't it). My wife and I are retired and on our budget we enjoyed eating at a restaurant called MOM. (Turn left to corner then right one block). Delicious food and hip atmosphere. Complete dinner with wine about E30 to E40 per person. They have a bar if you want in for less money. More to explore. Walking from the apartment: #Turn right 1 and 1/2 blocks then left on Boulevard Pereire for three long blocks around the circle and you..."

21354852,262600813,2018-05-09,137511985,Charlie,Jhon was accommodating and easy to approach and was quick to respond. Apartment is clean it is a shared bathroom with other apartments which was a bit different experience but manageable. Apartment is a 45 minutes walk from centre of Paris but we did find metro about 15 min walk away.
26007926,460844422,2019-05-30,15878241,Yifan & Wan,Very nice location and good neighborhood. You can easily access to main tour spot in Paris. The kitchen was full of functionality.

77482,308115,2011-06-11,585824,Melissa,We loved that this home was very much a home. It was a great location and had just about everything we could think of. We did have a lil bit of a hard time sleeping at first only because we are not used to hearing creaking floors if someone got up in the middle of the night..we all heard it.But it gave the house a very homey (Website hidden by Airbnb) had more than enough beds blankets and bathrooms for all of us..(we had 5 girls and 2 boys). We would surely stay here again and recommend to others as well.
30314984,460018545,2019-05-28,61108868,Alessia,"Great location complete silence in the apartment very comfortable beds. Stress free check in and check out.
The only negative note of the apartment is the “bathroom” facilities as the shower broke the first time my husband tried it and couldn’t be used leaving a family of 6 having to work our ways to wash without a shower. 

Apart from that thank you for your hospitality and great communication before and during our stay."
33461461,505468516,2019-08-09,71834543,Sarah,Appartement très bien situé. Rue calme compte tenu de l'emplacement (RDC donc un peu de bruit de la porte d'entrée). C'est là que Modigliani et Gauguin ont eu leur atelier même s'il ne reste plus qu'une plaque sur la façade qui témoigne de leur passage... Petite cour intérieure et marches usées pleine de charme.

1935236,447840079,2019-05-04,5132245,Peter,Marine is a great host. Easy to reach very welcoming and completely honest. Her apartment is in a fantastic location with the hip 11th out the door on the left and the even hipper Marais on the right. There are two metro entrances nearby for easy subway travel. The Richard Lenoir market is 8 minutes away and a Monop’ convenience store even closer. There’s a great new modern Paris restaurant on the street Le Saint Sebastian that’s worth a visit. And there’s a brand new cocktail bar right in her building’s ground floor for that little extra help up the five flights of stairs at the end of the night. The apartment is comfortable and airy and there’s enough kitchen equipment to cook simple meals.
24933188,296188444,2018-07-25,162592125,Eduardo,Excelente anfitrión siempre al pendiente y en comunicación. El departamento con muchos servicios y cerca del metro. Todo muy bien.

5768176,47748100,2015-09-21,16086822,Brian,Corinne was extremely accommodating.  Our travel plans were confirmed last minute so we had to make some changes regarding the key pick up; this was not a problem and was very easy.  She was there to great us at her place and gave us all the info we needed regarding the hood.  The neighbourhood was fantastic.  Close enough to the action but not so close as to not be able to enjoy a quiet night sleep.  I recommend her place to all Paris bound travelers looking for a more authentic Parisian experience away from all the tourist.  Very clean apartment has everything you need to be comfortable.  Also very close (5 min walk) to metro and groceries.

Un séjour très agréable pour un jeune couple"
38869970,554442546,2019-10-26,78877935,Ansis,The apartment is as described very spacious clean nice design on the ground floor in a nice courtyard. Sofa bed in the living room is rather small for 2 persons. Location of the flat is convenient for transport (near to Gare du Nord) bus 38 stops right by the door and takes you directly to Notre Damme. Montmartre is not far far - you can walk there. But area itself is very dirty and far from best in Paris.
1627041,77878889,2016-06-04,1787789,Lauren,Nous avons reçu un accueil très chaleureux de la part d'Annick. L'appartement est très bien situé et parfait avec ses 2 chambres séparées et la cuisine très fonctionnelle. Annick nous a très bien conseillé sur les commerces et restaurants à proximité. Nous avons passé un très bon séjour !

834161,339927865,2018-10-22,33522530,Darren,If you need to be near the Eiffel Tower want a clean decent sized bedroom with a well equipped kitchen and don't mind a fairly small bathroom you're onto a winner. For me it was the perfect place to stay for a business trip and I can imagine a great place from which to explore the central sights of Paris. Everything was very easy - from check-in through to check-out with zero problems.

15848907,222211335,2017-12-29,74655044,Lara,"La localisation de l'appartement est TOP. Il se situe près de deux arrêts de métro et quelques lignes de bus. 
Concernant l'appartement l'immeuble est très calme. Il se situe au 6ème étage avec ascenseur. 
Cependant la salle de bain n'était pas des plus propres. La porte de celle-ci ne se ferme plus correctement. Il manque assez bien d'ustensiles en cuisine afin qu'elle soit pratique."
29591556,426827923,2019-03-22,14423265,Wilfrid,"A mon arrivée j’ai été bien accueillie par une jeune femme.
Les explications étaient plutôt claires. Le logement était dans un état de propreté tout à fait correct.

En revanche 
Je n’ai pas été vigilant sur le détail de l’annonce
J’ai donc compris après coup et découvert sur place que le logement ne possédait ni WC ni Douche ni eau chaude...C’est un peu rude pour le prix..
C’est au 6eme sans ascenseur
La chambre fait moins de 9m2

J’avais sélectionné une chambre privée en pensant naïvement avoir tout le confort d’un appartement et pouvoir en plus avoir des échanges avec les hôtes .... Déception à ce niveau..

Le logement est très bien situé il était propre et la remise des clés a été très courtoise et adaptée sur la forme 

C’est juste pas ce que je recherche.."
9016519,262902365,2018-05-10,166900533,Carley,This apartment is perfect for a couple visiting Paris. It is very close to a Metro station and a few sites were walkable if you are up for it. There are many cafes and places to eat within walking distance. The place was small but clean and perfect for what we needed. I would definitely recommend!

656822,70893744,2016-04-21,12847065,Fiona,Jean-Baptiste is very friendly and incredibly helpful. He picked us up from the train station and helped us back to his apartment - even offering to help us with our luggage. His apartment is in a quiet and convenient area close to the metro and very easy to get around Paris. The room is enormous - enough room for 2 double beds and very clean and cosy. The kitchen is small but enough for 2 people and was fully stocked with breakfast condiments and other things that Jean-Baptiste kindly offered us to us. He also kindly allowed us to host a friend who we were also meeting in Paris for a few nights. One of the next Airbnb experiences we would love to visit and stay with Jean-Baptiste again! 
33032202,540775264,2019-10-04,54177291,Siri,Laure is a caring and professional host. The apartment was clean and met all our expectations. The area is buzzing with new cafés and restaurant and local small shops. It’s a bit off the beaten track but that’s what makes its charm!
27645478,447340345,2019-05-03,157857670,Benjamin,Great location right near the Arc de Triomphe with an easy 30-minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. Easy check-in process and a clean space with exactly what you need when you come back from a long day in Paris. Thanks for a great stay!

Thank you Harout for a wonderful stay!

3411801,269299379,2018-05-27,118234134,Gail,Host was great. Gave excellent directions. We arrived late he left the keys with a neighborhood restaurant no problem getting them. Gave us a tour in the morning of the neighborhood. Location is great walking distance to the Seine River Notre Dame and restaurants. Stairs to the apartment are challenging with luggage however we were informed ahead of time of the difficulties. Would stay here again maybe pack lighter to make the trip up the 3 flights of stairs easier.
1332991,97056577,2016-08-25,70542673,Moshe,"We had a wonderful time at Catherine's apartment. The apartment looks exactly like in the photos simply amazing and was super clean. Catherine went out of her way to make us feel at home with small little gestures that made us feel that she really cared. She was available at all times when we had questions and was very helpful. 

The apartment's location is super central and yet it's very quiet.  We highly recommend this place and we'll be happy to return!

5910106,303915808,2018-08-08,197424913,Claudia,Wir haben uns sehr auf diese Reise gefreut und das Boot aufgrund der vielen positiven Bewertungen gebucht. Leider mussten wir bei unserer Anreise feststellen dass die Unterkunft völlig unsauber war: staubig überall Spinnweben sehr viele Spinnen in den Räumen unsaubere Toilette dreckiges Geschirr und der Backofen war so sauber dass man ihn beim Aufklappen gleich wieder zugemacht hat.... Dazu kam das eigentliche Problem Schimmel!!! Leider ist meine Schwester Allergikerin. Für 300€ die Nacht leider nicht akzeptabel. Leider war Victor nicht vor Ort. Wir haben uns dann mit dem Freund von Victor getroffen und ihm mitgeteilt dass wir hier nicht übernachten können und wollen. Er hat sich auch bei uns entschuldigt und uns bestätigt dass wir unser Geld zurück bekommen. Leider warten wir darauf immer noch!!!! Victor ist sich keiner Schuld bewusst-trotz der vielen Fotos die wir geschickt haben und hat uns 30€ Reinigungspauschale angeboten. Das ist eine Frechheit...toller Gastgeber!!! Leider steht Airbnb zu seinen SuperHosts. Schade...
16324157,247958504,2018-03-30,87178145,Sven,The apartment is beautiful and has a perfect location. If you can't walk somewhere you can take the subway which will only take 5 to 10 minutes. You can even see a tiny bit of the Eiffel Tower from the balcony. We would definitely come back but bring earplugs because the street is a little bit noisy at night.
14611827,339175599,2018-10-21,122867868,Wendy,Our family had an amazing stay at Amandine's place.  Not only was the apartment spacious it was just beautiful.  The kitchen was well stocked and we had all of the comforts of home throughout the house.  Our hosts left great instructions on how to use everything in the house and they provided us with local suggestions for restaurants and grocery stores.  We absolutely LOVED the Latin Quarter neighborhood.   We were so close to many great restaurants lovely gardens other beautiful neighborhoods and of course the Pantheon!  We just can't say enough positive things about not only the apartment but our hosts who were just lovely to work with!  This will definitely be our go to rental the next time we are lucky enough to be in Paris.
16905683,221677114,2017-12-27,135818787,Kelly,My family of 10 had a fabulous stay. Highly recommend for a big group. It was great having 3 bathrooms and a common space. We opened Christmas gifts in the living area. It was lovely!

Un petit bémol la salle de bain (un couloir) et la douche qui mériteraient d'être un peu modernisés.

Franck was nice accommodating and he responded quickly to all my needs. He definitely exceeded my expectations. All I came for was a room but I received so much more. I definitely recommend staying with Franck if you visit Paris. He's in a great location about a 5 minute walk from the metro station.

18691747,260216439,2018-05-04,9780586,Dominique,"Overal experience was as good as previous guests': shower and bathroom areas had occasional wait times but were kept clean the hallway is equipped with basic necessities like tea and coffee check in and check out was extremely easy and bedding was clean.
The bed frames squeaked way too much for undisturbed sleep however and the room could've used some ventilation as it would get too hot during the night but otherwise guests were respectful and as quiet as possible.

For a solo traveler like me it was a great place to crash and the location was unbeatable for the price. There are plenty of chill bars and restaurants in the vincinity to explore til after the metro closes. ;)

Renaud was kind and helpful and made sure I was properly settled in after check in. Thanks!"

Y si quieren tranquilidad paz y relax elijan el departamento de Sylvain como vivienda!!! Recuerden que se los dice un matrimonio de mediana edad que viajó con la suegra. El departamento impecable espacioso y bien equipado hizo que me sintiese como en casa. Palabras aparte merece el anfitrión. Sencillamente un tipazo. Solidario divertido una persona que recordaré siempre.

2869175,45367030,2015-09-02,6666542,Martyn,I've been to Paris 12 times now stayed in a range of places from swank hotels to apartments. Pierre's apartment topped them all. Compact but beautiful huge windows balcony comfy secure. Lovely street lovely area lovely apartment. Great service and greeting too clear instructions. The Wifi was mega fast. The apartment was really clean. This seriously felt like a 4 star hotel but with added bonuses of a kitchen etc. Bakery across the road shops nearby cinemas. This place was such a bargain. Pierre - and his apartment - are 'exceptionnel'. Click the book button before someone else does.

We really liked the location. The area has nice shops cafes restaurants and just a min away from the train/tube station. Although the street is busy the studio is tucked away in a very quiet area and you walk through a cute courtyard to get inside the studio.

The kitchen had everything we needed and Carole had also kept chocolates for us!

We would definitely recommend this studio to all!

Thank you Carole!

We would definitely recommend this apartment.

Great kitchen shower felt safe though evening bar scene may require closing windows for noise. Fish fruit grocery bakery restaurants all on same block. Feels like Paris! My 21 year old daughter liked sleeping in the young daughters room. Main bedroom in back away from street noise and light. Well stocked kitchen with coffee maker we appreciated. Get the pastries in the morning across the street fabulous!

Solo eché de menos internet pero bueno como la estancia fue por trabajo lo aproveché para desintoxicarme. Tiene un home cinema estupendo enganchaba mi ordenador con el hdmi y me vi películas en el sofá. Es un sexto sin ascensor pero bueno es normal en parís y las vistas se compensan.

21815093,269322699,2018-05-27,24508685,Dmytro,"Catherine’s house situated in the heart of Paris just acros the road from Louvre. Thus getting to the main sightseeing and touristic spots was very comfortable. 
Apartments was very clean and all is in good condition. The only minor minus is a bed. It squeaks and is a little bit short for tall people but it’s because of it’s construction and due to small flat constraints.
Catherine was super frendly responding  quickly and wait for us in the apartment thus check in was easy. We get the direction from Catherine and (Hidden by Airbnb) maps works perfectly;)
Building is old so you could hear how stairs squeeze but it’s very nice atmosphere inside and it’s a quite neighborhood just near the Culture and Information ministry of France. My advise try not to open windows at night cause there were some mosquitoes. 
Catherine is super frendly and left some food and drinks in the fridge for us. Even yogurt for the breakfast and beer for the evening and some sweets)
All these should naturally make Catherine a super host with cozy convinient apartments it the very heart of Paris and ideal treatment of guests. 
Me with my wife strongly recommend Catherine’s apartment for ideal Paris staying."

9633291,318678657,2018-09-04,82813851,奕君,"这套公寓性价比很高总体来说推荐大家住｡最大的优势是地理位置极佳圣日耳曼区的中心周围应有尽有｡楼下一条街全部是很不错的网红餐厅酒吧甜品店晚上非常热闹;但是房子藏在面对内天井的地方晚上可以大胆开窗睡觉非常宁静｡没有空调也非常凉爽｡房屋主人大大咧咧虽然有时顾不到一些很小的细节比如水槽不够清洁､垃圾袋等日用品不能依据人数天数配备完全､并不亲自迎接之外总体非常大气｡我们最后一天退房后把行李寄存在了公寓里省去了很多麻烦｡房间布局紧凑但两张大床能宽松地睡下四个人在巴黎这样的城市是一种奢侈了｡厨房不配备脱排油烟机烤箱和洗碗机但做做轻食简餐绰绰有余｡餐具作料齐全｡浴室马桶合体空间不大喷头水压有限但是再一次提醒各位在巴黎有这样的空间条件已经很不错啦｡缺点是干净度只能打四分到不了一些酒店的标准:水槽中有水渍餐具上也遗留之前房客使用的痕迹｡浴室玻璃房上也是有水渍的马桶似乎并不那么洁白｡但是绝对不“脏”只是没有那么那么干净——浴巾被子及房屋各处的洁净度还是过关的｡总之性价比很高推荐｡
Un appartement qui possesse une position très centrale sur le rue de Buci une rue avec nombreux restos pubs boulangeries et supermarché juste à coté de la Seine. Près de bcp de sites historiques ou touristiques de Paris ce quis nous a aidé d'économiser vachement les frais de transport pendant notre sejour à Paris. Le rapport qualité-prix est le plus grand avantage de ce logement. 2 grands lits pour 4 personnes et la cuisine équipée de tout qu'il faut. Une petite imperfection ce serai la propété qui ne se conforme pas à certains critères d'un logement lucratif (e.g. la trace d'eau dans lavabo la toilette pas assez propre) mais généralement dire la propriété est absoluement d'une condition hygiène. Tout compte fait on est à Paris et avec ce prix... tout est totalement acceptable!!!"

1981461,489707835,2019-07-17,152730837,Brooke,"Okay so first please know that I realize that people (myself included) usually skip reading the completely perfect reviews (5 stars) because well nothing can be perfect right!!?  Please keep reading this because while nothing can be perfect this flat is as perfect as anything can get for a family of 4 (my husband myself and two boys ages 13 and 10).  

I would definitely say if you are a couple with one or two children or just a couple on your own this is the flat for you.  It might be a little tight for four adults but is definitely doable.  After all if you are all adults you probably won't be in the flat all that much but rather out enjoying all that Paris has to offer.  :)  We only used the main (master bathroom) shower because the secondary shower looked a little tricky and I didn't trust my kids not to get water all over. The secondary toilet is also very very small but that is common with Parisian flats and the main bathroom area is very large so we only used the secondary toilet if the other one was occupied already.  The kitchen was well stocked with coffee spices and all cookware.  They left us a personal written welcome letter and a nice welcome gift.  We loved the house guidelines giving us helpful tips of  things inside and outside of the flat and the area.  

Our family really enjoyed our stay. It was everything we thought it would be. The location is amazing the flat is very Parisian (according to my brother who had been living in Paris for the past two years) and that is exactly what we wanted. We loved the family feel of the flat and definitely took advantage of the kid amenities such as the ping pong paddles and the wood lawn bowling game.  That was a nice break from all the touring and adulting my kiddos did! :)  

Aurelien was amazing at communication and very helpful. I feel like at the end of the trip (even before that) we were not just renting the flat but more like staying at a friend's house!  Aurelien was very flexible with check-in and check-out which allowed us to come in for a late arrival and then leave our bags upon check-out so we didn't have to lug our bags everywhere or go to to the airport earlier than we needed to on checkout day. 

The flat is amazingly located. There is a small grocery store right around the corner cute Parisian cafes on the street of the flat even cuter side street cafes with local ambiance and flair very close  it's walking distance to the river and all tourist attractions but also walking distance to local kids parks and non-tourist things as well for a bit of a break from the hustle and bustle.  Easy access to the metro but really we didn't need to use that much because we would walk to most places.   We felt very safe in the neighborhood really no matter what time of day and night.  

We would highly recommend this flat and can see why Aurelien is so highly rated on this website. The reviews are true - this is as close to perfect as you can get. Thank you Aurelien! We appreciate your family letting us stay in your family home."

12467379,339895533,2018-10-22,159630221,Carmen,"¡El piso de Sophia es maravilloso! 
Su localización es estupenda tanto como para ir andando al centro (30 minutos a Notre Dame andando) como para coger el metro (parada Parmentier a 3 minutos). El piso se encuentra en un barrio lleno de supermercados bares cafés tiendas etc. IDEAL para cenar o tomar algo tras un largo día por el centro. 
El piso es tal cual aparece en las fotos chiquito pero con todo lo necesario. Yo estuve 7 noches y pude utilizar la cocina sin problemas (ideal para ahorrar unos euros). Si tuviera que decir algo negativo diría que la almohada era bastante incómoda. 
Sophia nos advirtió de la instalación de un andamio en la fachada pero no fue un inconveniente para nada. 
Sin duda si vuelvo a París (que sin duda lo haré tarde o temprano) volvería a quedarme en este apartamento."

1496150,17210987,2014-08-09,16697207,Trish,"
We recently spent 7 days in this very pleasant and comfortable apartment.   It was in a great location very convenient to many museums and attractions and walking distance to the Seine Ille de Cite Place des Vosges etc.   The Metro is around the corner and there are 3 others within  easy walking distance.  Plenty of good bistros in the area plus all the shops you need to  buy provisions for self catering right outside the front door.   We were welcomed by one of Ludovic's staff and when we later told them about a couple of small things in the apartment that needed attending to they were fixed immediately.   Based on the standard of this apartment I would not hesitate to recommend it or any other that Ludovic offers for rent.    "
7169503,279626344,2018-06-21,159935714,Vitalii,Great location nice studio and fast solving problems.  Unfortunately Roxane hadn't informed us about reconstruction of the house facade and it wasn't so nice to wake up under the eyes of builders through the windows. Nevertheless we'd got only pleasant impressions after staying in this wonderful city!

35176646,551449472,2019-10-20,62009232,Philippe,"Bonjour

Nous avons loué cet appartement pour trois jours.
Nous avons réservé sur le site AIRBNB et avons réglé le séjour.
Après le règlement de l'appartement  nous avons eu la surprise de voir que des frais été appliqués si  nous arrivions après 19 h.  Cela  n'était pas indiqué avant LE PAIEMENT de la réservation ce qui me semble abusif  :
entre 19h et 20h59 : 30 euros
entre 21 h et 22h59 : 50 euros
après 23 h : 80 euros
ces montants devant être payés en ESPÈCE à la personne venant nous accueillir. 
Concernant l'appartement celui ci n'était pas très propre moquette sale les équipements électriques ne fonctionnaient pas tous la literie n'était pas bonne.
Un après midi alors que nous revenions dans l'appartement  nous avons eu la surprise de voir un couple à l'intérieur de l'appartement qui nous a indiqué qu'il venait vérifier certaines installation. Personne nous a informé de la venue de ces personnes qui sont rentrés dans l'appartement comme dans un moulin.
Et pour finir avant notre venue nous avons reçu un message nous indiquons toutes les conditions à respecter ( pas de chaussures dans l'appartement pas de visite d'autres personnes etc...) et que le propriétaire habitait en face et qu'il pouvait surveillait nos agissements franchement  de tels commentaires laissent à désirer
Pour conclure nous ne conseillons pas cet appartement.

We were there during an unusually hot spell - the large window helped to make it comfortable but it was still hot! The neighborhood is full of cafes great for relaxing outside.  Thank you Benmoine!

여성분들끼리 온다면 동네에 흑인분들이 많아서 좀 걱정될 수도 있는데 가족이나 커플이면 걱정할 필요없어요~ 아파트자체 보안은 3중 보안이라 안전해요:) 

새로 리뉴얼한건지 방 깔끔하고 좋아요. 지하철역도 2개 노선이 지나가고 가까워요. 

단점은 뜨신 물이 정해진 양만 나오는거..? 딱 두 명 샤워하고 나면 뜨거운 물이 다 떨어지는지 좀 기다려야 뜨거운 물이 나와요. 

전반적으로 만족했습니다❤️"

Die Wohnung liegt in der Nähe des Nordbahnhofes (Hauptbahnhof) und des Ostbahnhofes. Die Metro Anbindung ist sehr gut. Das Haus ist sehr alt aber trotzdem ruhig.

Die Wohnung ist schön eingerichtet. Das Badezimmer und das WC sind getrennt. Die Duschwände waren mit Folien abgeklebt da diese anscheinend defekt sind. Dadurch entstand über der Dusche Schimmel welcher uns gestört hat. Die Hygiene des Bettlakens war ebenfalls nicht gut.

Insgesamt hat die Wohnung den Zweck erfüllt dass wir günstig in Paris übernachten konnten. Saul war sehr nett zu uns und hat uns sogar eine Flasche Wein geschenkt da wir in der ersten Nacht nur ein Kopfkissen zur Verfügung hatten. Die Kommunikation mit Saul war ebenfalls sehr einfach und er hat immer schnell geantwortet und uns auch bei der Anreise seine Hilfe angeboten falls irgendwas sein sollte."

While the flat has been modernized it retains a lot of it's historic character. The location is excellent with great transport links and a lot of tourist sites within walking distance. Highly recommended.

16464132,341184838,2018-10-26,134861860,Richard,Awesome place really good location. The host himself was a disappointment tried to get more money out of us when checking out due to cleanliness which was an unjustified request.

814925,14689354,2014-06-24,14736291,Feresa,"My husband and I spent 4 nights in Paris and stayed with Etienne and Bruno. They were such friendly and gracious hosts. Upon our arrival they had all the information (maps metro info etc.) we would need to get our holiday started. The room was exactly as it's depicted in the picture and it's spacious enough for a couple to stay in comfortably. They were so helpful and gave us recommendations for restaurants around the area informed us how to get around the subway system and told us about the events happening that weekend in Paris. Throughout our stay they were always around to answer any questions we had or just to chat. On our last night we were presented with a traditional French gift of wine bread and an assortment of cheese which was delicious!

This was our first time using AirBNB and we felt very welcome into their home and were sad to leave. Thank you Etienne and Bruno for making our trip so memorable we hope to be back again soon! "

416129,12143783,2014-04-24,1785073,Yagil,"We left the apartment the evening we arrived!
The place though in a great location and looks seemingly nice at first glance is run down and unsuitable to host people who want to spend a nice time at a nice clean and comfortable place.
The closets were quite dirty and the sheets smelled far less than fresh.
The bathroom is terrible both in regard to the water pressure and the way by which the temperature changes from cold to hot as it pleases itself. It is simply unsuitable for anyone to stand and take a descent shower. On top the ceiling is chipping off while you take a shower..
The bed is so uncomfortable that an hour attempt to rest gets you the worst back ache possible..
If the owner intends to rent the place and expect people to enjoy and feel nice staying there she better get it fixed the bathroom painted and the place cleaned thoroughly between one guest and the next so it be spotless like what one expect from any 'hotel' room. Please get a suitable comfortable mattress!!. 
Airbnb rentals are supposed to be a cost-effective alternative to hotel rooms. The point is that they should also provide the level of cleanliness standards one expects and surely a suitable level of comfort with basics such as with a good mattress and bathroom facilities.
The payment for cleaning added to the cost means the place should be fresh and spotless ready for the next guest to arrive.
We may be more sensitive than previous guests but the fact is the experience was such that we basically lost three days of rental paid in advance left the apartment hours after we arrived and paid for a livable hotel room to enable us enjoy our vacation in Paris."
17412140,422471520,2019-03-11,131975712,Emma,Yann’s home was wonderful. A friend and I stayed for three nights while in Paris and it’s truly a lovely little neighborhood. The Sacré-Cœur is located about a 5-10 minute walk away (beware- you will be climbing up stairs) and the location in Montmartre is excellent with great views of the city. There is a metro station close by as well.  The room was small but cozy and enough space for two people there were plenty of kitchen supplies. It’s right across from a really good fruit and vegetable store and a 4 minute walk away from a grocery store and pharmacie.  Great bars and restaurants around the area too! I enjoyed my stay.
603946,15720740,2014-07-14,17557906,Inga,Nicolas is a very nice person and responds very quickly. He does everything to let you have a comfortable stay in Paris. The apartment was as nice as described in the ad. It is located in a nice neighbourhood and from there it is easy to explore Paris either by foot (neighborhood of Montmartre) or by metro because the station is very close. We had a great time in Nicolas' apartment and definitely recommend staying there!!! 
21584974,508701802,2019-08-13,254592254,Olivia,We had a lovely time in Barbara's apartment. The space was cosy safe and homely and very clean. Barbara was not around for check-in but her friend showed us around the apartment and answered any questions we had. Barbara was always quickly available via text or phonecall too. The noise from the street can be an inconvenience if you're looking for a relaxing stay but personally it didn't bother us too much. Great location near the metro shops and bakeries. Would recommend and would stay here again!

Worth booking along for that! The apartment is in such a good location with great restaurants nearby (we went to ANNA which was wonderful) and easy to walk to Le Marais subways supermarkets and lots of fruit and veg cheese shops etc. Apartment was clean spacious and really comfortable. Philippe was really helpful responding to any queries that we had and check in was really easy. Definitely recommend!

7355355,303426962,2018-08-07,90966582,Dustin,Apartment is super clean and decorated how I would assume an old Paris flat should be.  Marie made sure I had everything I needed and gave me local tips on food and transportation.  It was unseasonably warm in Paris during my stay so the apartment was quite warm (4th floor) and the apartment building is on a very busy street so it can get quite loud at times.  Other than those minor issues Marie's place was exactly what I needed as a solo traveler.  I would definitely stay there again.  Thanks Marie!

23057794,527225517,2019-09-10,269764089,Donghwa,Before arriving in Paris the host contacted me to give me a detailed explanation. He greeted us at home himself and kindly explained it to us with a well-made manual. All the rooms and facilities were cleanest and comfortable. While I was traveling the host recommended a good restaurant and store and was kind. I was very satisfied because it takes about 5 minutes to walk to the Eiffel Tower and subway station. I highly recommend you to consider this house.

2827655,102412220,2016-09-18,1279694,Christie,"Nicolas' apartment is extremely gorgeous and in an amazing neighborhood. I'm not sure if I would stay there again. Initially (my mistake) I had thought that the rental was for the entire apartment. About two wks before the trip I got a message from Nicolas stating that he would be going out of town for business during our stay and ""would we like to upgrade to the full apartment?"". He said it would be $171 more. Turned out to be much more than that with airbnbs fees. I would have appreciated a clear price before I decided to take the full apartment. Nicolas informs you that if you are more than one hour late to your check in time that he would appreciate a message or email. When our train into Paris was delayed thirty minutes I wasn't sure if I should contact him or not. I found wifi in the cab( unfortunately AT&T phone service refused to work in France!) and let him know that we would be around 30 minutes late. He responded very rudely saying ""I wish I would have known this information earlier I'm guessing you have known for a while."" We didn't go over the hour late time (we were 30 min late) that he discussed via email so I honestly didn't appreciate the response. It was rude and unnecessary. On top of all this the wifi in the apartment did not work. We contacted him and he checked with the provider and informed me that he will be getting some money back on his plan that month. The entire stay we had no wifi and were unable to check in to our flight or email. It was definitely frustrating. I was surprised that he informed me that he would be getting his money back for the faulty wifi and that he didn't intend to refund any of our stay. During check out Nicolas asked us what time we would like to check out we requested as late as possible that was convenient to him because we had a late flight that day. He said he would talk to the next renters and get us a later check out. After the wifi was inaccessible for our stay he told us that as a way to repay us he gave us a later check out. This didn't add up to us. All in all the whole experience felt unwelcoming and frustrating. The rental of the entire apartment felt like a squeeze to get more money (he stayed in Paris the entire time we stayed there despite the fact that earlier he told me he'd be going out of town.) he often offered to give me a late check out for around 70$ more even though we had many times declined. We didn't NEED a late check out but if it worked out for him and his next tenants it would be helpful to us. He didn't seem to understand that. This being our third Airbnb experience..."

19817709,499204381,2019-07-31,177513018,Kate,This place is wonderful!  The hosts are thoughtful and attentive. The location is great!  There is an amazing little pizza place and an Indian restaurant that I highly recommend. You can run down to the market or pharmacy easily and grab whatever you need.  We were able to have tea and coffee and breakfast comfortably in the kitchen before starting our day and it was nice to get some take out when it was late and come ‘home’ and crash for the night.  There’s also a Starbucks and McDonald’s which was fun to grab a coffee or a snack on our way out for a long day. My friends and I (three adults and two kids ages 7 &3) loved the entire experience. The kids had a blast playing with the toys and were entertained the whole time.  Everything was wonderful. I highly recommend these hosts and this home. I wish I knew when I was going back to Paris I would book ASAP.  I’ll be looking for this space when I do go back!

The room is exactly how is described here and the metro station is really close (2min by walking) in the neighborhood You can find markets restaurants pharmacies and everything You could need finally I can say that the zone is really quite and safe."

509357,2596433,2012-10-13,2046905,Susan,I was verbally abused by the hostess on more than one occasion.  Things are not as they are advertised with this apartment; the kitchen is not fully equipped.  I was blamed for the failure of the microwave based on what I had put in it (tomatoes! for one minute!) and it was not repaired during my stay.  I was accused of having had another guest since I used 4 rolls of toilet paper within a 6 day stay even though I replaced the toilet paper.  All in all awful and unacceptable.  As an Airbnb hostess and regular client I do not recommend this rental.

16426860,182683157,2017-08-15,73930092,Rebeca,The apartment was exactly as described and showed in the pics. The neighbourhood was quiet and safe. The bus stop is almost in front of the apt which allows you to access Paris downtown in 20 minutes. The apt was huge and close to two supermarkets really appropriate to buy food. The place was clean and Margaux was in touch during our trip and waiting at the arrival to welcome and answer all the questions. She was super nice and she even provide us with some food for the first day (like milk eggs tea pasta etc.) and shampoo and other items for the shower. The wifi works really well. I would recommend this place to everyone looking to spend their vacation at Paris! Thanks for everything Margaux!

The apartment is a bit small and the stairs are a bit steep for the elders but still this is the best value apartment around the area. It is also near the sacre couer church which is convenient for people who would love to visit the church.

Thanks very much to Thibault and his family.

11530205,84263906,2016-07-06,79390612,Lois N Dan,We enjoyed our stay at Paris at 15 rue Dautancourt. It was about a 10 minute walk to the Lafourche metro station. The apartment was clean but small in typical Paris fashion. If you are a very tall or overweight you will have problems in the shower and toilet which was built into a separate small closet area. Other than those caveats we would recommend staying there. 
17917735,207056923,2017-10-28,114758249,Ben,Good location and a contemporary offering that offers something more than a normal hotel. Photos could be a bit misleading considering they’re complied from different rooms but they were all of an above standard. They have 24/7 reception which is amazing for those checking in late! However when we checked in we asked if breakfast was included to which they said yes only to be charged for it upon check out.
7977528,127820029,2017-01-21,4312645,Ben,"L'appartement de Marine est tres bien décoré et idéalement situé.

13663454,349941320,2018-11-18,6345978,Sarah,"This place is amazing. It's just like the pictures. Small but what an amazing place. Such character. Check in was super easy and the sitter was very amenable. Located near a metro station it was easy to get to and easy to find. 

A close stroll to the Eiffel tower and a great cafe bar at the end of the street. 

The place was spotless (which I still don't know how they manage) and had everything we needed. Even though you close to everything it was very quiet at night


It was an amazing place to stay and certainly made our stay memorable."
19758799,309974502,2018-08-19,47411866,Sam,Chloé’s place was clean tidy and fashionably decorated. Really for me it was perfect as it had a nice view from the balcony lots of pretty terraced houses opposite and was on the top floor. Although going up six flights of stairs is tiring it does enable you to work off all those calories you’ve put on eating in Paris! All in all I would highly recommend Chloé’s place to fellow travellers.

It is located in a really cool area there is always something going on but it's quiet enough of you want to go to bed early. I didn't get to meet Jordan but she was very informative on how to get to her place and was quick to respond on any questions. I highly recommend!

The apartment is very clean and its equip with every essential appliances.  We were impressed.  But most importantly so very close to Eiffel Tower restaurants and metro.  Took pictures of the apartment and posted them on our (Hidden by Airbnb) for our friends to see.  We definitely will want to stay there the next time we're in Paris.

Petit détail sur la conformité des photos et la réalité : l’appart n’est pas aussi lumineux que sur les photos d’autant plus que vous avez du vis-à-vis sur la rue et aussi sur la cour intérieure."

8269878,289062906,2018-07-11,184890772,Culeca,"La ubicación es perfecta!! Montmartre es el mejor barrio para salir a conocer tener restaurantes y bares en cada esquina. El apartamento es bien pequeño (1 o 2 personas). No tiene cama es un sofá cama. Que cuando se abre ocupa la sala. Pero esta bien cuando solo vas de dormida y sales a conocer a Paris todo el día. Lamentablemente no hay aire acondicionado en verano Paris es muy caliente por eso recomendaría un lugar con aire acondicionado. 
Es un poco extraño encontrar cepillos dentales y utensilios de otras personas no es que está mal pero fue una experiencia diferente. En mis otras reservas y experiencias no habían artículos personales en los apartamentos (como cepillos dentales muchos shampoos y jabones zapato)"

The apartment is sleek and comfortable for a family of 4 (including two teens) and located in a small and quiet street. "

4507851,440714956,2019-04-21,6684709,Carolina,The family is both kind and friendly and I am happy that I got to know them during my stay in Paris. The park next door is beautiful there are many restaurants and grocery stores close by and the neighboorhood is save. The cat is adorable and loving. However the combination of the apartment being old (bad sound insulation) together with the family's often loud conversations in the morning and at night made it difficult for me to sleep properly. It should be mentioned that both tenant and guests smoke inside the apartment. I wish the family all the best.

Definitivamente nos recibieron muy bien su sobrino muy agradable y a pesar de no hablar español nos pudimos comunicar con el con el poco ingles que sabíamos.
Nos ayudo en todo momento.
Se encuentra muy cerca la estación del metro y a unas dos cuadras el rió.
Todo limpio y super ordenado.
El wi-fi ok el desayuno sencillo pero muy rico. Nos preparo un chocolate caliente a la hora que quedamos y el pan delicioso.
Posterior mente Marie-Christine llego y tuvimos la oportunidad de conocerla.
Ella habla español y fue muy grata su presencia. Tuvimos la oportunidad de platicar con ella y fue muy agradable.

Gracias Marie-Christine.

32326491,437739228,2019-04-15,225979924,Barbara,"Extremely conveniently located; shopping supermarkets health food stores cafés. Consistent hot water and good water pressure in the shower. Heater in living room and bedroom kept us cozy and made drying clothes very easy. Washing machine in the apartment. Lots of windows and natural light. Nicely decorated and all new appliances. 

Be sure to get clear instructions on how to locate the key and have your phone charged in case you have questions. There is construction going on in the building so the hallways look uninviting but be assured that the apartment is all new and very clean and comfortable. The work is done during the day so sound wasn't an issue."

On peut facilement se déplacer à pied pour se rendre au Louvre Jardin des tuileries Comédie française ou encore le Palais royal. Les transports sont à proximité ce qui est très pratique. On trouve à proximité de nombreux restos très sympas et tout le nécessaire est à disposition (supermarchés boulangeries pharmacies). En résumé l'emplacement est idéal. L'appartement en lui même est fonctionnel agréable conforme aux photos et très lumineux. Pierre-Antoine a également été un hôte à l'écoute et réactif en cas de besoins !

We ciuld not have been in a better location for Bastille Day festivities. with Eiffel Tower fireworks and the military parade in full view from out balcony.  It's relatively close to most points of interest (we walked everywhere!) and there is a great supermarket close by.

The apartment itself could use some refreshing (and some more wine glasses!) and the building is in disrepair (a sparkly new glass cube elevator is a stark contrast to dingy walls and torn carpet in the halls) but it's all easily overlooked for this gem. I would definitely recommend it!"

A descarga também não funcionou direito. A água também dava para 2 vezes e nunca enxia.

Outro problema era o vizinho de cima que do nada batia algo com força para não conversarmos. 

Mandei e-mail para os proprietários e eles apenas responderam sobre o chuveiro. Achei isso ruim mas pela limpeza conforto e localização e um bom custo beneficio para que está em 4."

13553836,200151126,2017-10-04,11778653,Jenny,Staying on Alphonse was a great way to experience Paris. The boat is a a beautiful space & so close to everything. I was a bit worried as I do experience motion sickness but apart from a couple of brief wobbly moments had no problems. The bed was super-comfortable & we slept really well the 3 nights we were there - considering the position of the boat it is amazingly peaceful once inside. Enjoyed breakfasting in the deck. Thank you again Charles for your welcome & giving us the opportunity to share your piece of French history.

7260466,53067950,2015-11-04,9351749,Robert,The apartment is in the center of paris 200m to the metro 7 Cadet. It is quiet and clean. While it is rather small (typical for paris) it was adequate for a city trip for 2 people. NB you need to share the bed!
1999745,12164349,2014-04-24,13450149,Benoit,Benjamin est une personne vraiment sympathique et souriante. Il a toujours été disponible pour nous et nous a mis bien a l'aise a notre arrivée avec un joli petit message de bienvenue. L'appartement était très bien entretenu exactement comme sur les photos et nous avions a disposition tout ce dont nous avions besoin. Nous avons passés 5 jours magnifique et nous reviendrons a coup sur chez lui ! C'est un endroit idéal pour visiter Paris. Encore merci pour tout :)
15808508,342741897,2018-10-29,50734067,Leona,This location was excellent and on a very quite street. Close to several Metro stations.  My daughter and I walked everywhere during the day and at night along the Siene River. Very safe. We were 5 minute walk to Notre Dame steps to the Louvre; an exceptional location and foot steps away to every iconic site. A great neighbourhood for shopping dining bars and organic super markets. A fully modern equipped kitchen with upscale appliances; a large open concept kitchen and living area which was very comfortable and very clean. The king size bed in the upstairs loft was very comfortable. Wi-Fi was exceptionally fast. I loved having coffee/wine on the balcony overlooking Parisian life. Nathan and Benjamin were great hosts and were very prompt in replying to our needs. We appreciated Benjamin’s attention in carrying our luggage to the fifth floor very attentive. I would highly recommend this place and its location. I will come back. Thank you for a wonderful experience. 
349296,141076610,2017-04-02,7612976,John-Erik,"The view! The location! The Charlie!

The location is hard to beat if you wish to live in an apartment overlooking the center of Le Marais with everything at your fingertips. The view with a wrap around porch is amazing and worth the five stories of steps to arrive. Charlie is an excellent host who knows the area inside and out and was happy to give many insights when I checked in. All at a value much better than I expected.

The accommodations are not fancy or luxorios by any means - everything is quite modest - but you have what you need for a pleasant and comfortable stay."
3935768,471350640,2019-06-17,14731780,Alice,"Amelies place was in the perfect location to wander the cute streets of Montmartre. She was very responsive and easy to communicate with check in was very smooth and the flat itself is perfect with everything you would need. Even views of the sacre coeur! 
Amelie had some lovely suggestions for restaurants and bars very delicious and good value. I would highly recommend staying at her place if you want to explore Paris and stay away from the business of the centre."

6071713,346652771,2018-11-09,31293966,Christine,We had a wonderful stay at Aurelia and Florian's place. The apartment is charming and cozy with lots of natural light a functional kitchen and lots of personal touches. The location of the apartment is fantastic. We were often the only tourists in the cafes and shops in the immediate neighborhood but the Metro is less than 5 minutes’ walk and the Latin Quarter is easily walkable. Aurelia and Florian were friendly and responsive throughout the entire process. They genuinely wanted us to have a great experience in their home city. They gave us fantastic recommendations. One recommendation in particular which they were adamant about turned out to be a highlight of our trip.
11900174,98936955,2016-09-02,67166108,Mia,By helping us each step of the way.Sending us msgs throughout our stay saying she would be available if we should need anything.

22739649,259667657,2018-05-01,44262239,Katie,It is a studio about 15 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower. The space was very clean. But it is small so not for more than 2 people. She is very responsive. The bathroom is very small and does not have a door but instead a curtain so it does lack privacy.
16698710,553400911,2019-10-24,27396750,Tim,L'emplacement est juste parfait l'appartement est très fonctionnel et l'arrivée à n'importe quelle heure est très arrangeant. Dany m'a accueilli en personne très sympa

534016,62191366,2016-02-12,19754114,Mary,"Sam's apartment was the perfect place for our adventure in Paris! The location was ideal for walking it is very close to grocery stores boulangeries cafes and is just 1/2 block from a major bus line. We stuck with walking bus and taxi travel and it was super easy. Mrs. Ewa met us at the apartment and she is lovely she doesn't speak English but Sam was on the phone with her to help communicate. He made it very easy for our check in and we found the place very quickly. 

The neighborhood has lots of children and we felt very safe. Most importantly  we have wonderful memories and cannot wait to come back to Paris for another adventure!  Don't be afraid to visit in the winter  Paris is gorgeous no matter what time of year you visit."
16556816,423496508,2019-03-14,9093452,Maria,Jean-Pascal’s place is small but nice and has all you need. It’s very Parisian (in size and style) and conveniently located.

21642259,216200527,2017-12-03,116301,Marguerite,We are so happy this was where we stayed while spending ten days in Paris. The apartment was exactly as pictured very clean and perfect for my husband and me. I loved that we had a real kitchen table to sit at as well. The bedroom upstairs was so peaceful and having the terrace was great. The location was perfect. Very close to a convenient metro station as well as within walking distance to a lot of sites. All while feeling like you're not in the center of a touristy area which for us was important. The neighborhood has all amenities that you could want within minutes from grocery stores restaurants pharmacies etc. I would love to stay here again!! Highly recommended.
1350971,479594065,2019-07-01,7531078,Romuald,Loft loué dans le cadre d'un événement regroupant famille & membres associatifs : magnifique cadre spacieux et baigné de lumière très bel accueil et super flexibilité de Xavier donnant accès à une cuisine toute équipée incluant vaisselles de table.

26188730,491561274,2019-07-20,165267574,Penelope,This place was so lovely! Super clean and centrally located. The host left a list on great restaurants in the neighborhood a few of which we tried and really enjoyed. There is a fan above the bed which itself is very comfortable which made the hot nights lovely. The bathroom is beautiful and the jacuzzi tub is an awesome touch at the end of a long day walking and biking around Paris. Highly recommend!

The place was smaller than I thought but got used to it and enjoyed it! I’m 6” tall and the bed was perfect (it was one of my concerns when I initially saw it). 

Overall a great host and a surprisingly quiet clean and neat location."

22623241,285573615,2018-07-04,10219820,Chabha,On a été très heureux chez toi Adrien. On s'est senti comme chez nous en famille.

Het is een levendige buurt. Wel vaak sirenes van de politie om de hoek. We hebben ons geen enkel moment onveilig gevoeld en van ons bezoek aan Parijs genoten.
2387929,141843450,2017-04-05,31981944,Bruno,"Un appartement calme et bien localisé à quelques mètres de la place République. La chambre est agréable et le lit spacieux. Le salon un peu étroit donne sur une cuisine moderne et plutôt bien équipé.
Le lieu est très bien puisque toutes les commodités (magasins restos métro) à deux pas.
C'est Éliane qui nous a reçu elle a été conviviale et prête à nous donner des informations intéressantes pour sortir sur Paris. L'absence de Bouzra n'a en rien entaché sa disponibilité ainsi que sa bienveillance. Il a répondu très promptement à tous mes messages."
27074652,427810250,2019-03-24,77679320,Adriana,Very clean and comfortable apt. Generously supplied water snacks and essentials. Easy to access the metro and safe neighborhood. Would be happy to come back again.

10873534,103385295,2016-09-22,19566820,T,"Gabriela was a fantastic host.  She communicated great especially since my french is almost non-existent. Even though I kept changing my check in and out times she was completely flexible.

The description of the place is accurate it is a small studio with a loft.  A perfect spot if you're looking to be out and about in the city and just looking for somewhere to crash at the end of a long day.

The location is incredible close to the train/metro and right in the heart of a vibrant shopping and nightlife area.  Compared to other places I had stayed it was quieter at night too which was great."
2092008,70495807,2016-04-18,63296308,Antonio,The place was quiet and cute my girlfriend and I absolutely loved it. The area was great a short walk away from the metro and scattered with stores and restaurants. The apartment felt very cozy and I loved the Windows.

Yes the view is one of the best in the world but beyond that the hosts are going out of their way to provide a memorable experience. Everything from the color coded robes to the chilling champagne in the fridge it screams French hospitality. Michel has certainly helped us overcome the mild challenge of the stairs.

The apartment itself represents the essence of a fairytale Parisian retreat! We had a truly great sejour and are truly grateful. We recommend this place in the strongest possible terms!"

The flat was close to many cafes bars and markets. Public transportation was only a block away which made getting to most places easy and within a 20 minute subway ride. The flat itself was clean and cozy and the owners were very helpful in the whole process! We would definitely stay here again!
15848907,250468232,2018-04-05,13644522,Takeshi,"It was great room and very clean.
But there is difficulty for check in.
First when you check in you need to to to cafe. This cafe is little far from the room. And I should get key code for the box but I didn't get. After I called the host I got the code by SMS but there is no code....
Any way there was difficulty for check in. And for check out this bar is not open until 9am so it's difficult to check out before 9am.... and I need to insert ic tag to this key machine it doesn't work.
Anyway it was difficult to check out too...."

583636,7812782,2013-10-04,7908225,Ha,"Modern apartment with 2 Metro stations closeby (only 3 minute walk to Rue Saint Maur station) which is very handy to access to all the tourist attractions in Paris. Perfect for single or a couple traveller. Tanya was great. She showed us all the amenities and access details and was patient when we arrived 30 mins late after we got lost in Oberkampf station There is a supermarket downstairs which makes it convenient if you need to by or cook anything. There are few really good restaurants close by. One I would recommend is Pierre Sang's (finalist of Top Chef) restaurant in Oberkampf which is just 6 minute walk from the apartment and there are normally queues outside his restaurant. Would stay there again :) Thanks Tanya.

great local scene next to many lovely cafes and restaurants.  Easy from CDG via RER/Chatelet-LesHalles and then a quick 5min walk. Nice kitchen and appliances.  The main bedroom did get a bit of noise from early am deliveries so if light sleeper might need to adjust. Loft spaces are small and one is ok only for small child as ceiling is low. All in all an amazing spot to explore the Montorgueil area."

22846255,455810053,2019-05-20,35849362,Andrew,Very prompt and warm communications from Catherine and a lovely personal welcome to the apartment from Christine. Located in a wonderful part of Paris and close to great restaurants and attractions. The apartment is compact with lots of character has all the amenities you need for a week including a washing machine and is very well maintained. There’s a lift to the 4th floor and then a short flight of steps. Several supermarkets are nearby for groceries as well as the St Germain markets. We really enjoyed our stay.
21195137,317553155,2018-09-02,31869671,Michelle,"Sophie‘s place was great - its location is perfect and there are some really nice restaurant and bars around. All important sightseeing points are easily accessible. The apartment is quite small but if you are just two people it’s perfect and very cosy - I would recommend staying here if you are travelling in pair.
The communication went on without any issue and the check-in was pretty easy. Sophie is really helpful too would come back!"
13725363,306850667,2018-08-13,17692434,Irene,The location is on a busy street and as the apartment is just one floor up from the ground floor the traffic noise is constant.  The neighborhood is definitely 'boho'  with hipster restaurants and cool graffiti but also has wandering drunks and people sleeping on the sidewalk nearby.   Having said that the apartment is spacious and comfortable it is very conveniently located within a few minutes walk of several small supermarkets (including Biocoop an organic shop) the subway the canal and a park with two playgrounds.  We never felt unsafe and took the kids to the park every evening.   Anne-Charlotte was helpful and friendly...thank you Anne-Charlotte!

The host was great and even brought us a 2nd fan given the uncharacteristic temperatures. 

Bed was very comfy and the rain shower provided nice and cold water. 

Also if you like ice in your drinks that is also not very common in Paris. I did leave 3 ice trays for future guests! 

Until next time!  Merci!!"

His hospitality is very good. In his absence we were welcomed by someone else but this went perfectly. 
Of course nothing is ever perfect but staying came pretty close. 

We had a great time in Paris. Montmartre is a fabulous neighborhood with tiny shops and restaurants. And when you wander offf the Sacre Coeur and the Place du Tetre way from the tourists you can find a quiet place to walk around..
Staying at Oliviers gives you an opportunity to feel like a Parisian."

The location was perfect - the nearby area is very cool with lots of lovely restaurants boutiques and close to the river. I would definitely stay here again - a perfect cool cosy spot in Paris!
13583929,205389790,2017-10-22,22721923,Adam,Great apartment in the heart of Belleville. Spacious and clean. Mathilde was a great host. Would stay here again
1216733,46693792,2015-09-13,30606225,Hulusi,The Nest is Montparnasse is exactly as its name describes a cozy and self-sustaining abode for a sojourn in Paris. Rachel and Simon our lovely hosts greeted us the day we arrive let us leave our bags with them and explained everything we may need for a comfortable stay. There is a farmer's market in the alley within the Edgar Quinet Boulevard where you may shop for cheese vegetables fruits and ready meals. We even picked up some little gifts for our friends back home such as artisanal soaps and lavender pillows. Within minutes walk there is the supermarket Monoprix where you may obtain every other item you may need in addition to the groceries. The location of the house is so central to the city with easy access to Metro and train system it is quite possible to have some rest between your outings. The access is very reliable and security is high in the apartment. The neighbors are polite helpful. Wi-fi works without any problem. Some outside noise is possible due to social activity especially during weekend nights but it is not raucous and ends in bed time. We were happy to stay here and would stay again if we visit again. Highly recommended for one or two people.

3672320,186684266,2017-08-25,55738609,Séverine,Ce petit appart est tout mignon sympathique relativement calme et bien décoré quoique légèrement vétuste ce qui ne m'a pas dérangée. Il est à deux pas de Montparnasse qui a plus de liaisons avec les transports en commun que Gaîté. Le quartier est super sympa (théâtres restos Jardin du Luxembourg Cimetière Montparnasse pas loin du quartier latin...). L'accueil a été efficace et sympathique... Je pourrais bien y retourner un jour :-)
33306806,495533946,2019-07-26,273014702,Syed,Often places close to tourist attractions usually aren’t well-priced and amazing. You usually end up paying for the location and extra for a clean place.  That was not the case with Chez Tina.  The host was good with replies and gave helpful tips when we asked.  The apartment is very clean and very spacious.  We are a family of 5 and it was more than ample for us (with room to spare).  The bathroom/toilet were spotless and the shower had very good pressure.  The location a few minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower was the best.  We took a late night 11 pm boat cruise and checked the Tower lights and easily got home without a hassle.  Highly recommend this place. Would definitely stay again.

Thank you !"
2170652,15454449,2014-07-09,15107599,Gouri,Elodie is a warm helpful person.  She waited for us patiently as we had some difficulties in getting to her place. The appartment is a good walk from the metro station Place de Clichy but close to bakery supermarket and ATM. As the TV AND internet in the apartment didn't work during our stay we had a difficult time because we had planned to use it to make local sightseeing bookings etc. The appartment itself is great with enough space for 4 people + toddler. The one flight of winding stairs are a bit tricky if you have heavy luggage ( like we did). The bedrooms don't have fans / air conditioning so it was somewhat uncomfortable to sleep at night.
2412144,250789552,2018-04-06,124251158,Ella,Marc was extremely accommodating and helpful! My sister and I's flight got delayed by a few hours but he was patient and had no problems meeting us when we landed. He gave perfect and easy to follow directions to get to the airbnb which saved us an expensive cab ride. On top of that when our phones wouldn't connect to the wifi he went out of his way the next day to fix the issue (which worked and then had wifi). It's a perfect location - you are within walking distance to any of the major sites you'd want to see (or a short train ride away). Overall it was a perfect place to stay while in Paris!

26216204,482295319,2019-07-06,52474445,Laurel,We had a lovely stay at Yankel’s flat. The flat looks exactly like the pictures and is a good deal of space for Paris. Warning the 5 flights of stairs feel like quite a lot after a long day of touring. But being on the top floor allows for more windows to keep the place cool at night. We stayed for a week during the beginning of July and could sleep comfortably. Yankel was a fantastic host and responded very quickly and efficiently to our questions. We did have some problems with the bathroom sink leaking and the washer not working properly but Yankel was quick to send his maintenance man the very next day to have the issues resolved. We would definitely recommend the space for an active couple visiting Paris. Also: warning there is a small step going into the bedroom. BE CAREFUL. We had many many many stubbed toes.

Le domicile est acceuillant grand et silencieux. Marie Estelle à été presente tout au long de mon séjour. Je préconise vivement cette gentille dame. Nous n avons manqué de rien! A bientôt je l espère
12810933,180774058,2017-08-11,3120403,Rachel,What a find this bright and airy place is!  We were pulled in by the proximity of the Eiffel Tower in the listing photos but it did not prepare us for JUST HOW CLOSE you really are.  When we walked in to open those French doors for the first time we all screamed!  That view is worth everything sitting on the sofa watching the tower sparkle every night is pretty special.  The place is clean bright open.  One bedroom looks out onto the Eiffel Tower green. The en suite bathroom is lovely.  The other 2 bedrooms have a beautiful view of the neighborhood Haussmann style buildings with their iron balconies. Location to other major Paris points is wonderful as well.  I took a beautiful 25 minute walk home from the Grand Palais.  Stay here you won't regret it.

Comunicazione con l'host Geneviéve veloce e rassicurante. Piccolo supermercato sotto casa così come locali e negozi. Abbiamo alloggiato in quattro (2 adulti+2 bambini): ottimo per un soggiorno breve. In una decina di minuti a piedi si raggiunge la stazione di Châtelet - Les Halles dove arrivano direttamente i treni dall'aeroporto CDG (RER B) e quelli per Disneyland (RER A).
Sicuramente tornerei per un prossimo soggiorno a Parigi."

3826033,438311407,2019-04-16,221010457,Emily,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Elif's lovely apartment. The location of the apartment is perfect- I hadn't realised how close it was to so many shops  and cafes etc. creating a lovely buzz in the area (but without feeling really congested). The Boulangerie around the corner was amazing and we visited there many times in our stay. If you want an authentic Parisian experience I would definitely stay here! It was great value too! Would definitely come back; on top of that Elif is such a nice person and Pikachu is just adorable! Thanks Elif!!
862705,46601685,2015-09-12,4187043,Nicole,This place is perfect! It is exactly as the photos depict and it is clean and very comfortable and pretty. The shower is also great. I chose this place because I used to live in Le Marais and their apartment couldn't be better situated--so close to everything you could want. I also felt very safe on this street and in the neighborhood. Someone was there to let me in and show me the apartment and Serge called later to check in and was so nice. I will be staying here whenever I come to Paris!

There is possibly no better location in Paris to set up headquarters as a tourist. The apartment is fantastic and has excellent subway access.
With great restaurants and Notre Dame literally around the corner you really can't ask for much more.
The owner is a kind and extraordinarily helpful gentleman who enriched our experience on Paris."
20228815,475325069,2019-06-24,62479626,Christine,Nice apartment in a great location. Very comfortable living space for two. The bathroom is very nice with a great shower and hair dryer. The bedroom is simple with a comfortable queen bed. We were there during a heat wave so the place was a bit warm at night. Overall I was happy with the location size and cost.

Der Gastgeber und die Familie (welche uns empfangen und wertvolle Tipps gegeben hat) waren sehr nett und zuvorkommend. Ebenso war alles in einem super Zustand. Es ist ruhig und sicher (die Gegend ist nicht so schön). Die Wohnung befindet sich im vierten Stock (kein Aufzug vorhanden!). Die Dusche war ein Traum! *-*

653458,523233480,2019-09-03,11594681,Juliana,A casa do Cris tem uma localização excepcional !! Ao lado do metro e supermercado carrefour o que otimizou bastante nosso tempo la. O sofá cama se transforma em uma cama super confortável . Foi uma supresa boa porque não tem foto do sofa cama aberto. Como o metrô é bem perto da para ouvir algum ruído mas é tão sutil que hora nenhuma isso nos incomodou. Como Cris estava viajando fui recebida pelo Julien que foi super atencioso e respondia rápido qualquer duvida que tive. Valeu demais !!!

We felt very much at home during our visit to Paris.
25037271,429870028,2019-03-29,81132977,Kim,Yannick's place was very nice and even better than the photos showed.  We loved the little balcony and it was very close to the metro and easy to get around.  The decor was very nice the shower was amazing and the apartment was well equipped with everything you may need.  The mattress seemed new and was quite firm.  Not my preference but for our 3 night stay it was fine. I would definitely stay there again!  Loved it!!
27865343,448358822,2019-05-05,247841494,Marina,"Квартира нам понравилась очень уютная и чистая. Есть все необходимое вкусно пахнет. Есть стол на террасе но у нас была плохая погода мы там не завтракали но для лета  просто отлично будет. Для 2 человек не тесно. Единственное не было вешалок и все вещи мы держали в чемодане. 

Jean Luc приехал раньше по нашей просьбе так как мы прилетели очень рано и передал ключи. 

Расположение близко от метро но мы не учли так как не знали что пересадка часто через Saint-Lazare там слишком много народу это напрягало. Но до Монмантра мы ходили пешком (20 минут) - это очень удобно! Рядом есть супермаркеты кондитерские рынок даже симкарту мы смогли купить только недалеко от дома. Все рядом есть.

Рекомендуем!"
33601381,504195978,2019-08-07,2700440,Anastasia,Axel's apartment is very beautiful and located just perfect. If I get it right unfortunately there were problems with cleaning company — there were no toilet paper (but Axel told he can pay the bill and that was nice) no soap and shampoo and problem with towels so we could only use ours. There was heat during our stay but in the apartment it felt very comfortable and we didn't need fan. Apartment is very stylish and kitchen is more than fully equipped: there were everything you can imagine even carpaccio slicer! The thing you should know before arrival that there are host's things around: cosmetics in bathroom drawers clothes in the bedroom. It doesn't really bother if you are ready for that. Just near the apartment there are a lot of good cafes and streets are lively. We enjoyed our stay thank you!
4250873,174232494,2017-07-25,129534611,Emily,Such a great location and surprisingly big room! Was very clean and tidy. Would 100% stay here again :) thank you!!

33190275,447191802,2019-05-03,45936023,Raluca,Myriam’s place was very nice and in a great location. However her place did not have wifi. She also did not let us know the entry code of the building so if there would have not been a person there by chance to let us in we would have been stuck. Overall great stay just some miscommunication issues!

And yet it is very quiet and perfect for a good night's sleep. We definitely recommend staying here for easy access to everything.

It was our first time stay with Airbnb and was worried at first as it was one of the important season/trip of the year. (New Years)
- but Antoine really made our stay perfect.

Antoine have been more than helpful from the beginning with advising us with restaurants/tips around the area.

The location of the apartment is pitch perfect in centre Paris. The apartment is not only clean but with very good security that you feel safe.
Stylish apartment with luxury brands everywhere and everything was so organized.

So glad that we chose Anotine`s apartment to be our first Airbnb stay and I wish I could again stay in his apartment very soon.

Whoevers next - You are lucky person"

The metro is close Monmartre is steps away and there is a grocery store pharmacy and bakery right there.  It was clean and comfortable. It is in the heart of the city so it can be loud.  We found earplugs helped at night. We found Artemis to be a great host and her neighbors were there when we arrived to give us a tour of the flat and some helpful tips.  They were all very nice.

16288098,542300770,2019-10-06,175736785,George,"We stayed 10 nights in Michel's flat. It was excellent: clean quiet and spacious. We felt completely at home after just a day or so. The flat's central location close to the École Militaire Metro and bus stops makes it easy to move about Paris. The flat is on the 4th level above a bustling shopping and restaurant street that can be noisy in the evenings but the flat's large windows are so well insulated that street sounds are barely perceptible. La tour Eiffel is visible from the flat's front windows. Windows in the kitchen and bathroom open to a quiet courtyard in the rear of the flat. The furnishings are simple but comfortable. The bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was outfitted with everything you need to prepare and serve simple meals. We enjoyed a petit déjeuner each morning with fresh croissants from a couple of nearby boulangeries and yaourt from one of three close grocery stores.

Michel reached out to us several times ahead of our visit to offer suggestions and checked in with us during our stay. Regrettably he was out of the city during our visit but we were met at the flat by his assistant who made sure we were settled and comfortable.

Overall an outstanding experience."

30393336,501088476,2019-08-03,189096582,Luke,This place is amazing! It’s right in the middle of everything you want to see when visiting Paris but it’s private and quiet - perfect for relaxing after a day of sightseeing (or resting your sore feet after miles of walking on all of the cobblestone streets and uneven sidewalks in Paris).
2648444,336297230,2018-10-14,172161360,Guido,Comfortable clean room to visit Paris on a budget. Extremely responsive host allowed me to leave the luggages after check out. Would recommend

1303078,16702541,2014-08-01,2419923,Sarah,My husband and I spent a month at the penthouse in Le Marais and it was absolutely wonderful. The apartment is even more stunning than it appears in the pictures. I cooked a lot in the kitchen with all of the fresh ingredients that I found just around the corner on Rue de Bretagne. The terrace was incredible; we had coffee out there almost every morning delighting in the views of the city and the beautiful flowers planted by the owners. The apartment is huge with plenty of room for work space for two writers. And we loved the location; the apartment is very central but also on a quiet street away from tourist-central. Olga was an amazing host very responsive to any questions that we had during our stay. I am already dreaming of my return.

4749584,212142703,2017-11-16,24500480,Tara,Anne's apartment is cozy and efficient. My partner and I stayed here for a couple of weeks while working in Paris. The quartier is good full of useful amenities - especially the marché - and close to public transport. The apartment has lovely windows that let in much light and open onto a quiet spot of green in the neighborhood. Anne did drop into the apartment twice while we were not there - she did notify us first however since hosts had not done this in previous Airbnb stays we found this odd. In general a good experience and place to go home to after a day of work.

They also offered me coffee and breakfast daily. 

The house has a smoke odor which didn’t bother me too much but if you have an aversion to cigarette smoke you may want to find another place.

But then again Paris is the city of smoking! ;-)"

24262826,536773899,2019-09-27,273242910,Jurij,The apartment was very practical great for solo travelers. The location is also okay the metro is quite close. The only thing lacking is wifi so make sure you have enough mobile data didn’t bother me that much since my stay was shorter. The host is also very friendly helpful and responds quickly.
18318445,459984057,2019-05-28,244392761,Glory,Alice's apartment is clean spacious and simply decorated.  It is in a great location within 500m of two metro lines and the RER.  Lots of food shopping and cafes available on Rue Daguerre and other streets very close by.  The kitchen is well equipped.  The apartment is relatively quiet for being on a busy street as it is set back in a private apartment complex with a large green space.  The apartment perfectly suited our family of two adults and two children (under ten). The children had their own room (sharing a bed) and were delighted with the toys and books therein.  We adults had our own bedroom as well. (Another bed can be made up in the living room.) There is a playground within walking distance.  The apartment has many windows and is quite bright.  Alice is a great host.
1271817,469201576,2019-06-14,4339382,Graham,"Not as expected. Given the rates I paid are equivalent to a half-decent hotel the property was not as described. Looking back on earlier reviews I expect the property has deteriorated since it was originally listed. I messaged the host twice prior to arriving with questions but got no response. On arrival discovered a bad smell in the bathroom. The soil pipe has no vent on it. We had to block it with an old towel found in a basket of dirty linen. The shower cubicle has black mould. The broken floorboard (mentioned in earlier reviews) is still broken. More concerning was the fact that the light switch in the bedroom was completely broken  (also mentioned in a previous review and has never been fixed).  so we couldn't use the bedroom light. To make matters worse there wasn't even a bulb in the living room light so couldn't stay in that room after dark. I messaged the host who came on day 2 to replace the bulb and he messaged me to say the light switch needed to be replaced by a professional - so it was unusable throughout our stay.  One and a bit rolls of toilet paper for two people for three days???
Regarding the location it is very good - right in the heart of the 5th Arrondisement and literally one minute from the metro station. Lots of restaurants and a lovely market round the corner. Check in was easy. Five flights of stairs (no lift) but that is all as accurately described in the details. The apartment is light and airy but tired and needs some attention. Disappointed that faults raised by previous guests (including potentially dangerous electrical fault) had not been sorted. Shouldn't really be renting this place without these faults being addressed. I have rented other apartments in Paris on AirBnB and they were much more accurately described."

830268,147139823,2017-04-25,2735775,Mariia,Только что вернулись из Парижа из этой удивительной квартиры. Отдыхали большой семьей - я с мужем и ребенком (1 год и 7 месяцев) сестра с ребенком (1 год и 9 месяцев) мои родители. В квартире есть все для удобного и комфортного проживания - стиральная машина даже сушильная машина на кухне холодильник плита и все необходимое в комнате телевизор диваны столы. В последний день я заметила что у входа лежали путеводители на разных языках и даже карта метро. Меня вообще восхищает когда так все предусмотрительно продумано. Есть и моющие средства и стиральный порошок и чай и кофе! Заезжай и живи! Восхитительно! Постельное белье одеяла подушки - без нареканий. Но все в одном комплекте. Жилье расположено в 15 районе до Эйфелевой башни 7-10 минут пешком мимо кофеен магазинов с продуктами ресторанов. Район тихий спокойный много булочных со свежими круассанами аптеки магазины продуктов рестораны станция метро и автобусная остановка - 2 минуты пешком. По средам и воскресеньям в 2 минутах у метро располагаются великолепные парижские рынки под открытым небом. Мы покупали свежие морепродукты и овощи фрукты. Квартира находится на 1 этаже нам дали 2 комплекта ключей что было очень удобно. В доме есть внутренний дворик где можно покурить и выбросить мусор. В этот дворик выходит окно из кухни. Мебель не новая местами пошарпанная но она хранит в себе дух парижской жизни старинные люстры тяжеленная огромная красивая кровать комоды резное дерево великолепные кресла.... Хотелось фотографировать каждый угол. Чувствуется что квартиру делали хозяева для себя с огромной любовью. Единственно - мы отдыхали в апреле в квартире было прохладно окна старые. Но это тоже не проблема-просто теплее одевались дети бегали в домашней обуви. Слышимость с соседями тоже хорошая слышно было как наверху топают и общаются. Но все очень уважительно себя ведут и никто не шумит после 8 часов нам запретили пользоваться шумной стиральной машиной и сушильной машиной но это только вызывает уважение к хозяину ведь это говорит о том что и наши соседи после 8 вечера не будут шуметь и будут уважать наш отдых. Вообще я в восторге от всего! я рада что мы не жили в шумном Марэ или Латинском квартале ведь мы были с детьми и родителям которым необходим полноценный сон и отдых. Я влюблена в эту квартиру и советую там остановиться всем тем кто хочет увидеть старинную парижскую квартиру пропитанную духом Франции и заботой хозяев.
7870965,84352024,2016-07-06,32195770,Neema,Apartment is very small but equipped with the essentials. There are no bath essentials provided such as: shampoo soap towels and very little toilet paper. Maud was a bit late in meeting us but it worked out nonetheless. The bathroom is extremely small. The whole thing gets wet when you shower so if you are a person who wouldn't enjoy that this place is not for you. But if you are looking for a place located in a central position close to all types of restaurants bars metro and shops and you don't mind a very small place then this place is perfect for you.

The location was absolutely perfect and I would have a hard time now wanting to stay anywhere else - one block from St. Germain and two blocks from Pont Neuf yet on a quiet little cobbled street.  The Metro Odeon stop is only one block away as well. The apartment was very well equipped  - we truly felt like it was our little home in Paris for a week.  A terrific experience and highly recommended.

The location is better then we expected with access to boulangerie fromagerie epicerie and  boucherie around the corner. A short walk to the metro and you get anywhere you want to go in Paris. Close by Parc Buttes Chaumont the canal just facing the house with multiple good restaurants to try short walk to cite des sciences. House had everything we needed Gilles was a great host and our stay was perfect.

Check-in and out was easy. The appartment: interior:cosy and clean with everything necessary for two couples coffee machine and fully equiped kitchen even with laundry machine good beds and two big bathrooms.

You can chill on the sofa looking at Eiffel tower and Sacre Coeur...both are much closer in reality then on photos.
The apartment itself is very comfortable with two separate double bedrooms with very comfortable beds. There are lots of shops and cafes around and metro 5 mins walk. If you're vegetarian there is a good veg only indian place around 15 mins walk Krishna Bhavan. Montmartre is about 20 mins walk. Highly recommend this place and would love to come back one day!"

23097352,491426555,2019-07-20,253850749,Paul,There is virtually no hot water for showers.  There is heavy metro construction going on right outside and it is extremely loud all day and it destroys the view.  There are no lights in some rooms and the second bedroom has no A/C.  There are virtually no wine glasses (in France!) and the apartment could be cleaner and modernized.  Disappointed.

1855118,47373026,2015-09-18,25231909,Susan,We had a wonderful stay at Annamaria's home. Annamaria was a kind and thoughtful host welcoming us with everything we needed to know as well as a few appreciated items in the fridge. Her flat is very comfortable and nicely appointed with lots of intriguing books and ornaments. The location is perfect. The flat is close to many things and there are metro stations near by but just off the beaten path enough that you get a neighbourhood feel. We highly recommend a stay in her flat.

26631671,513135849,2019-08-19,69240348,Ariella,"Eric is a friendly and well-meaning host who provides accommodations which are sufficient to stow away your bags and have a place to sleep at night but we would be remiss not to mention the issues experienced with this Airbnb. 

The overall issue with this apartment was that it did not feel much like an Airbnb. It more closely resembles the experience of crashing on the cot of your friend's roommate who happens to be out of town for the night. Other than the two towels laid out on the bed there was nothing to signify that this was a rented room. While the bedroom was large and there was a decently-sized table several and chairs at our disposal the corners and shelves of the room were overflowing with someone's belongings. Both sections of the closet were unusable as it was packed with suitcases blankets etc.

There was a fairly strong odor in the apartment that was either from food or cigarette smoke but airing out the room during the day was not possible given the number of bugs flying around the plants rotting on the ledge of the one window that opened. It also didn't feel like the safest area in which to leave the window open and it was unclear who had access to the area outside the window on which the windows of several other apartments faced. 

The number of locks and doors between you and the street seemed to reflect this. However rather than give us a sense of security the apartment felt confined and claustrophobic. Given the age of the building the possibility of fire was a genuine concern. Due to the poor explanation about how the doors work we found ourselves repeatedly trapped between two sets of locked doors set in very narrow hallways both leaving and returning to the building. While the room itself is large we went to sleep feeling vulnerable in the event of an emergency. The fact that there was no fire detector mounted on the ceiling made this concern even more acute. The listing claims that there is a fire detector but we saw none in the bedroom or the kitchen. This should be rectified immediately.

Perhaps due to the fact that we were staying only one night there was very little attention given to the kitchen in our brief orientation other than cracking the door open to offer the use of the coffee machine in the morning. Even had we been staying longer the dim lighting the smell of food (or perhaps the large bowl of dried leaves that was spilling onto the counter) hanging in the air and general lack of cleanliness would still not have made it inviting for food preparation. The fridge worked fine and we were thankful for it. There was a washer in the kitchen but we never attempted to use it.

For obvious reasons the bathroom door was not opened while we were being shown the room. We are sympathetic to the age of the building and limitations of space but little has been done to make the washroom more inviting. The toilet is connected directly to a large pipe meaning there is only a toilet seat no toilet seat cover and the pipe leaves no place for the seat to stand making sitting down the only way to use it.  The small reading light fastened to the wall was too weak to properly light the room and was too low to give light at all when you were in the cramped shower.

The bed was not particularly comfortable but we were exhausted and made due. What was more difficult to ignore was the fact that the sheets did not feel or appear to have been laundered. There was a significant amount of someone else's hair in the sheets and on the pillows that was noticed as soon as we climbed under the sheets. It felt as if we were intruders in someone's bedroom who might walk in at any moment. 

Contributing to this feeling was a computer work station (two monitors a tower several other computer components etc.) that were all on turned on it's LEDs glowing in the darkness. We had no idea why it was on while we were there or if it needed to be on at all but were afraid to power it down.

So while this was listed as an ""entire apartment"" it felt more like a shared space. More so than actual shared space listings we have stayed in.

The host was very nice and we take no pleasure in writing a negative review but I feel that this space could be made more inviting if a little more effort was put into it. It felt as if the host did not have enough free time to be properly running an Airbnb. It took three months for a response to the questions we sent upon booking the apartment and by the time we received the response we were halfway through our vacation. When we replied informing him that the situation had changed since the message we had sent back in May (that he only just responded to on the day we were arriving) we were told that he couldn't come any earlier. Had we not pressed we would have been stranded with our luggage in the streets of Paris. Thankfully after many messages back and forth we were able to come to a compromise but this could have been avoided had there been better communication from the outset.

Again nice friendly well-meaning host and great location but we would recommend it only for people needing a place to flop for the night or stash their luggage. It's not particularly ""cosy"" or ""charming"" as is but with a bit more effort it could be."

6843733,464712373,2019-06-06,257692805,Carlos,Location was amazing centrally located in the middle of Paris. Metro stations within 10min that made it easy to get anywhere. Walk out the door and there's cafes restaurants and shops. It's a regular studio type flat so don't expect it to look like a hotel room. It was clean enough and everything worked.
12426131,177963497,2017-08-04,94002753,Zak,"This is a very beautiful and spacious apartment. I was immediately comfortable in Julien's home the moment I walked in as his friend Adrien who sorted out check in was very welcoming. There is a lovely espresso machine already set up in the bedroom which is absolutely perfect. The room has plenty of floor space with large wardrobes and a lovely balcony overlooking the street and a very nice park. There's a supermarket coffee shops and restaurants within a few minutes walking distance which are great additions. 

Would definitely seek this place out when returning to Paris."

Appartement vraiment calme et lumineux ! Et bien situé avec une bouche de métro à 5 minutes à pieds.
706572,29614260,2015-04-10,10012319,Itai,"I have to be honest - our first impression wasn't so positive - since
the place was a LOT smaller then we expected and it's practically impossible to keep the blinds open as it shows on the nice pics since there's a passage that leads to the rest of the building that goes right outside of the windows.  
 BUT the place was clean and warm it has all the basic things you need and a few small extras that made us smile like the night light lamp and the ketchup and mastered packets left for us in the kitchen - very thoughtful :)
SO - the bottom line is it's a nice place with a great location just  bare in mind it's very small."

989228,9287509,2013-12-18,786363,Chitra,"I stayed here with my husband and my toddler (1.5 yrs old) for a week in December 2013.  Jonathan was a great and very helpful host. This apartment is clean comfortable beautifully furnished - exactly as in the photos and description. One small exception is that one of us found the bed a little uncomfortably uneven on the side (only one of us - we actually disagreed about this). But we wouldn't hesitate to stay again if we come back. Although it's in a bustling neighborhood with lots of nightlife the bedroom overlooks the inner courtyard and is pretty quiet though you can feel the faint regular rumble of the metro. we had a visiting family member who used the fold-out couch for one night and she was very comfortable. the neighborhood is wonderful for high-quality ingredients if you want to prepare your own meals (good produce bakery butchers fishmongers etc though they are not there every day so it takes some planning in advance). This is also a perfect place to stay with a small child - the apartment is spacious uncluttered and safe it's a fun layout (3 of the rooms are connected in a circle the kind of thing small kids love to run around and around) and there's a nice playground around the corner (Ave. Jean Aicard).

L’appartement est proche de toutes les commodités situé au cœur du quartier de la Bastille dans une cour intérieure l'appartement est calme et proche de Metro bus bars et bons restaurants. 
Elle avait tout préparé quand mes sœurs et moi sommes arrivés. Serviettes sur le lit articles de toilette disponibles….en plus il avait un panier avec la carte du métro de Paris et des différents informations touristiques. Ce une des meilleures expériences en utilisant Airbnb en Paris.

20868444,261319918,2018-05-06,100186870,Yi An,Florent is a very nice host who allows me to drop our luggage early so we don't have to carry weight with us during the day showering and kitchen set are in ideal performance and the attic is very steady so you won't feel any acrophobia when sleeping on it. The apartment also has abundant ingredient for cooking purpose(oil salt etc.) save you $$ on buying those thing which you can't consume them all during the stay. Also security is very well there are two passcode locks before doorstep. Overall it was an excellent stay thanks a lot Florent!

18906553,200419802,2017-10-05,147681562,Cheryl,Olessia is a great host! The place is really clean and I love the antique wood furniture in the apartment.  The best part is the terrace. The windows open wide and you can see the gorgeous purple sunsets in Paris with a glass of wine on the terrace. The location is convenient to the Metro right across the street and the bus out front goes to Gare du Nord. Olessia always responded quickly to texts before the trip and was there to great me.  The linens smelled clean and had just been washed. The only thing that could have been improved was that the comforter and sheets on the bed were not fully dry but I put the comforter in the terrace room and it was dry a few hours later. There is a Monoprix grocery store next door which was great. I didn't use the kitchen much but it was nice to have it there.  This is a quiet neighborhood at night but felt self for the most part walking from the Metro late at night.  Thanks again Olessia.
19406539,279935453,2018-06-22,26525813,Tina,"Gautier's place is a gorgeous bright and airy apartment just steps from Sacre-Coeur. There are loads of cafes & places to grab a quick bite or coffee around the apartment and just a few minutes walk to the closest metro station. There's a good little grocery store just across the road which was super convenient. The street that the apartment faces can be a little noisy with traffic but you don't really hear it from the bedroom so it didn't bother me. 

Check-in was super easy and flexible which was great. I was able to pick up the keys at a restaurant across the street so I didn't have to worry about getting to the apartment at a specific time. The apartment was clean and very roomy with excellent Wifi signal.

I did have an issue with one of the keys to the entrance which was sticking on my first day ~ luckily one of the neighbours heard me struggling and unlocked it for me. Gautier was very responsive though and when I emailed him about the issue he gave me a contact number for one of his friends in town (he was out of the country) who could give me a spare key. After the first day the outer door was never locked so I didn't end up needing it. Gautier checked in with me a couple times during my stay to make sure everything was OK and to see if I needed anything. He was a great host.

I should mention that there isn't a dresser or closet where you can unpack your clothes but that wasn't really an issue for me. There are hooks and a few hangers on the back of the bedroom door which was enough for the clothes I had that needed to be hung up. And the bookcase in the living room was mostly empty so I just used that as an 'open concept' closet :)

Overall I really enjoyed staying at Gautier's place and would happily stay there again the next time I'm in Paris."
16769186,147401591,2017-04-26,5801844,Alejandra,The apartment size was perfect for me as a solo traveler. It was clean the bed was comfortable and the shower was large with great water pressure. There's a small kitchenette and area to eat but I never used them. The drawback is the unreliable wifi. After a safe place to sleep the wifi is critical to having a good trip. I don't get international plans when I travel and count on wifi and so far have never had a problem. The wifi at this apartment worked maybe 30% of the time. The consequences is that it prevented me from planning my activities for the next day sometimes not being able to secure tickets online which museums suggest to do. And unfortunately it prevented me from meeting up with a new friend I had met on a tour. Clara was very responsive the times I could get through to her and she did swing by the apartment to check the wifi. She said it worked. But unfortunately it didn't work most of the times I needed it. Before my trip I planned to stay at another apartment in Marais and at that location the wifi worked all the time so it wasn't my phone that was the problem.

16519068,527564226,2019-09-11,36577439,Sarah,Super helpful and friendly hosts. Apartment feels bigger (it's two floors) and came equipped with lots of kind touches such as cooking equipment recommendations on where to go and so on. As we went in the fall multiple space heaters kept the place toasty despite being in an older building. The neighborhood was very charming and close to the subway. It made for a very nice romantic visit to Paris.

Another thanks is that our luggage was delayed when we arrived at CDG and later she offered such a big help in our communication with the airport and in finding our luggage. She also gave us a lot info about location and food recommendations. Amazing host and flat!"

3310335,34055395,2015-06-04,29071333,Lourdes,We stayed in this apartment 4 nights and we had a really nice experience. We arrived an hour later than expected and the owner was still waiting for us. The place is just like the pictures very clean and tidy. All the facilities worked great and the shower was awesome! It also has a nice heating device that is great for the cold days. Location was very good due to the great connections available in the nearest metro/rer station and all the near shops and markets (on Sunday there is a colorful street market with many people selling all kind of stuff). We have no complaints and look forward to come back again!

19222664,200178164,2017-10-04,3762468,Chelsea,Pam's Air BnB was absolutely perfect. Not only was the design gorgeous but Pam and Fabrice were both so lovely. We had everything we needed.
5029618,36765955,2015-07-01,15707643,Eveline,We had a very pleasant stay at Natalie's place. There was a bit of a hiccup about our arrival communication could have been better there but otherwise absolutely perfect. Nice location close to public transport and very nice little square with small restaurants. Sometimes noisy but one would expect this in the middle of a large city. The appartment is small but everything is there. We were two adults and two kids if we would have been 6 people then it would have been too small. But we never got to spend a lot of time there too busy doing sight seeing. I would happily recommend this appartment to anyone wanting to visit Paris for a few days.

Também disponibilizou alimentos na geladeira para nosso consumo. Perto do metrô o que tornava fácil a cegada aos locais. Apenas tivemos problemas com a senha de wifi que estava incompleta o que foi sanado ao se acessar o laptop que ele deixou à nossa disposição. Também achei que a limpeza do chão da cozinha não estava tão bem feita. No mais casa impecável. Entretanto para os que têm problemas com locomoção o apartamento fica localizado em um quarto andar sem elevador o que dificulta um pouco a subida com malas pesadas bem como a subida de idosos e crianças.

6821557,38195456,2015-07-13,4279187,Jon,We had a great stay at Alexandre's flat.  It is very well located all the fittings and appliances are new and it has a very fresh feeling.  Alexandre was very easy to communicate with and made a special trip back to the apartment to help us when we were having wifi issues (the cables had come loose from the box - once this was sorted the wifi was very reliable).  Thanks Alex for making our trip so great.

15555158,249383304,2018-04-02,39675807,Vibeke,This place get top marks for location view and a host that made it real easy with the keys. The place is perfect for a couple that wants to be in the middle of Paris but yet no noise and safe in the evenings. Beware that the stairs makes it necessary to have good legs and a strong back to get a suitcase up those last narrow ones. One star was deducted because of a shower pressure that gives weak a new meaning and it was a bit messy even though cleaning is included. Other than that I can recommend it. Thanks Clara.
15216488,111413499,2016-10-31,48774816,Maryse,Logement très bien situé environnement très calme. Idéal pour 4 adultes. il manque un espace pour prendre les repas tous ensemble.

Le boulevard est un peu passant mais le logement est au 6ème étage et les chambres donnent sur l'arrière qui est calme.
Nous avons bien apprécié ce logement et nous y retournerions avec plaisir.
Beaucoup de livres pour les enfants et aussi des jouets c'était parfait.
Merci pour le charmant accueil.
A bientôt"
8113042,88890416,2016-07-25,48335813,Adam,"The neighborhood and environs are so easy you almost don't need to leave the three square blocks around Place Contrascarpe. It's really an amazing location and situation. The apartment is on the 3rd floor with no elevator so be prepared to haul your luggage up and down and to return there at the end of a long day's walking around Paris to traipse up the stairs again. 
The apartment was more than enough for three of us but wasn't so comfortable for four using the pull out sofa. If you can confine yourself to both bedrooms the unit is wonderful full of amenities for the kitchen a big bathroom and living space. Just be aware that it gets hot in the apartment even on just a warm day and you can't leave the windows open since there's a lot of noise below. But with the windows closed you can't hear a thing.
Washer and dryer full or queen beds and a great host all around. THanks!!!"
1030228,4500070,2013-05-08,3956019,Julie,We had a lovely stay at Soraya's flat! She booked us on very short notice and was very helpful in getting us to her place. My husband and I were in Paris for work and this was a perfect place to stay with a great internet connection which is a must for us. The futon bed was exceptionally comfortable and it was very nice to have a standing shower and a washing machine. It was also very quiet at night which was nice. We also appreciated the treats she left for us - it was a very nice welcome! We would definitely recommend staying here.
4766306,56119387,2015-12-09,1225255,Iosu,"Nuestra estancia en Chemin Vert 2 fue muy placentera.
Laurence nos ayudó en todo momento para hacernos sentir como en casa.
El barrio es sumamente tranquilo y el vecindario es un remanso de paz así que el descanso en este apartamento está asegurado. Las camas son muy cómodas y el sistema de calefacción funciona muy bien lo cual es de agradecer tras un largo día bajo el frío del invierno Parisino.
Cerca del apartamento se pueden encontrar supermercados y restaurantes y la parada del metro más cercana está a unos 100 m.
El apartamento es tal cual aparece en las fotografías y dispone de todo lo indispensable para tener una agradable estancia.
Sin duda repetiría mi estancia en este alojamiento. "
5444590,115826212,2016-11-27,36804231,Malcolm,This place was great! Perfect for a couple just looking to get away it feels like an actual home. It's in a quiet neighborhood and within walking distance to multiple metro stations so getting out and exploring Paris was easy. Philippine was awesome communicating and making sure we were accommodated even though she couldn't be there to meet us. Recommended.

Il a été à l’écoute et flexible pour l'heure de rendez-vous de récupération des clés du logement extrêmement clair et précis dans ses indications sur le lieu et l'accès de celui-ci l'appartement est idéalement situé dans un immeuble rénové tout est très propre et bien conçu (avec une baignoire!) et cerise sur le gâteau une petite attention nous attendais à notre entrée dans les lieux... 
Nous sommes partis en couple et avons eu peur à la réservation que l'annonce soit ""trop belle pour être vrai"" surtout vu son prix... Et croyez moi j'ai bien cherché mais je n'ai pas trouvé l'arnaque! En fait il n'y en a pas. 
Simon est un hôte comme il en existe peu qui prend son rôle à cœur est attentif et arrangeant sans vous en faire payer le prix fort.

J'aimerai vous dire le contraire afin de garder cette adresse pour moi et rien que pour moi mais impossible; foncez chez Simon et faites vite car il sera sans aucun doute victime de son succès rapidement!! "

2680478,277863613,2018-06-17,173901962,Lucy,We had a terrific experience at Frank's apartment! The home is cozy and comfortable and the location is really ideal -- so close to both Notre Dame and Place des Vosges. It was easy to feel like we were part of the neighborhood. Such a wonderful introduction to Paris for our family of four!
37801,816496,2011-12-31,1178845,Elizabeth,We enjoyed our stay at Marc's apartment. The location was superb - surrounded by a great variety of shops and markets (fantastic for food in particular) and close to Metro and RER stops. The Eiffel Tower was a lovely backdrop to the street and within easy walking distance. As a family of five we found the sleeping arrangements to be quite suitable (and the small lift not a hindrance as it was reasonably quick). The living room and bedroom were spacious with plenty of hanging space. It was simple to use the washing machine and the clothes dried quickly enough on the supplied airer. Marc was a very helpful host who communicated well and was prompt in meeting us for our late-night check-in and early check-out. We would happily book the apartment in the future.

1689202,89749719,2016-07-29,31492326,Megan,We stayed for 12 days in July 2016. Fabio was in close contact right from the time we made the booking and was responsive right through our stay. Except for the malfunctioning water heater everything went smoothly and was exactly as advertised. The neighbourhood was great - shops and restaurants close by and easy access to two Metro lines and the RER made getting anywhere in the city (and out of it) very easy. The flat was comfortable and well-supplied. All in all a very pleasant experience!
21709361,508610110,2019-08-13,82108717,Sharon,This place was super cute. Perfect for a solo traveller. I personally liked that it was a little further away from central Paris and the main tourists spots. It was also super close to the metro line which made it easy to commute around the city. I actually didn't get a chance to meet Caroline as she was out of town but her friend who helped co-host was very friendly and helpful. I just wish there was wifi!
26278,2963080,2012-11-26,175532,Tom,I have stayed at Jeff's apartment three times so far over the past three years.  As I wrote to Jeff leaving Paris this time it is my intention to stay at his apartment each year for as long as he will have me.  I love the little apartment.  It feels like my home.  It has everything I need (well-equipped kitchen hot showers clean free wifi convenient location (to the Metro as well) great neighborhood quiet street etc) and it just feels like you are really staying in Paris not as a tourist but as a very short-term resident!  Jeff is the ideal host.  He communicates well and gives you information to help you but then lets you discover the Paris you want to discover.
27078428,301527100,2018-08-04,8065485,Eveline,"I stayed in Laurence appartment for 2 nights with my 12 year old daughter. The place is well located not even 5 min walk from RER Luxembourg also near some shops (groceries) and restaurants - we did not check them out but had a pick nick in Jardin du Luxembourg instaat as it was so hot during out stay in Paris.  
The appartement is on the 4th floor (there is an elevator) and it has big windows overlooking the courtyard. It is quite enough no street noise only some neighbours music (nothing loud very charming no noise at night) 

What can I say more then that we felt like real parisiennes staying in this smart appartment. It has everything you need well equipped kitchen good bed and a supershower - small but very comfy.
The communication with Laurence went very well she replied very quickly it made me feel very comfortable and welcome."

5259829,523220918,2019-09-03,58228007,Louis,"A very basic but adequate apartment in a fantastic location.

Firstly I found the flat to have some damp with the smell in the air very noticeable when the windows are closed. Upon inspection I could find the damp in the corners of the bathroom and spiders webs in every nook and cranny. This place needs a deep clean!

The bed is also very low quality and I felt it could have collapsed any minute.

The neighbours are exceptionally loud and both nights at midnight I could hear tables and chairs being moved upstairs combined with loud shouting. Of course the hosts cannot be blamed but the walls are paper thin and far from soundproof. I was wearing earplugs and they didn’t help! 

Check in was quite smooth no real complaints as I arrived a little later than the agreed check in time. 

Location is great with some fantastic eateries in Montmartre."
10643968,262320386,2018-05-08,2445795,Eugenia,"Wonderful experience. Florian was so helpful and kind. Always checking in to see how my stay was he truly wanted me to have the best experience possible. The area is really cool and I loved that I was able to experience historical Montmartre. Something to note it is further from Center of Paris however the metro is a quick walk from the apt and so easy. You will be able to get around easily. 

There are so many local bars and restaurants near the Apt. especially if you walk up towards Sacre Coeur or take the train to Pigalle. The apartment was great! Clean and comfortable I truly felt I was living like a local Parisien. I loved staying at Florian’s place and would highly recommend it."
1364907,222202101,2017-12-29,47531797,Jonathan,A great place to stay for the Eurostar traveller  5 min walk to Gare du Nord station and even closer to the metro station.  Easy to find with perfect communication from the host.  Spacious apartment even with six of us staying with everything you need to make your stay comfortable and stress free.  I highly recommend this apartment we had a great time and will be back.
2871271,289401418,2018-07-12,15865867,Sandra,"We had a great time at Erwann’s place. The street was quiet and the house as well. We felt very safe in the neighborhood. Restaurants and supermarkets not to far.
We would book this place again and recommend it to friends."
530942,172199827,2017-07-20,22160895,Amir,"I very much enjoyed staying at Richard's place. I was traveling with 3 family members (all adults). Richard was very responsive while we were there and his son in law Jerome left hi number if we had any questions (his English is quite good). Richard and his wife were there to greet us when we arrived with a bottle of wine and a baugette! His apartment comes fully equipped with three room and two full bathrooms. He also leaves a booklet with a bunch of great information such as; great restaurants in the area relevant telephone numbers for emergency or taxi and other great tidbits. Everything you see in his posting is accurate. The location is also fantastic. Its very close to public transportation (Paris is very accessible walking or by bike). He is about a 5 minute walk to Bastille which is a very hip restaurant and bar district and ten minute cab ride form the center of Lu Marais which is arguably the 'hippest' neighborhood in Paris for shopping and eating. The neighborhood where the apartment is located is very safe and very quiet. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking to stay in the 'real Paris' where the Parisians go. Its about 20 minute cab from the Eiffel tower and Champs elseeys. Again you can bike from his house to those locations and its very enjoyable- In fact suggest doing so. I would stay here again. 

NOTE: The home like many residential areas in Paris does NOT have AC. As you can imagine it was quite hot at night in July when we visited. There are two fans in the apartment which helped."

15323185,202419195,2017-10-11,10992477,William,We stayed in Florence’s very nice apartment for 7 nights.  We can’t say enough good things about our stay.  First of all Florence gave us a very good orientation to the apartment and building pointing out all the things we needed to know.  The apartment is modernly furnished very much to our taste. It was very well equipped with everything we needed — bathroom supplies cleaning supplies kitchen supplies and equipment.  The water was very hot which made showering lovely.  Also drinking water was very good.  The location was absolutely fantastic.  It was in the heart of many major attractions — 1 to 3 minute walk to two different Metro stops 5 minute walk to Notre Dame 5 minute walk to Sainte-Chapelle 20 minute walk to the Louvre.  Now for the neighborhood.  It is lively and vibrant.  A wonderful supermarket is just next door to the apartment.  There are restaurants all over the neighborhood and because there are so many prices are very reasonable.  Our favorite restaurant Creperie de Cluny is just across the street with great prices great food and wonderful servers.  Enjoyed the many street musicians.  Also enjoyed the permanent (?) tent market right around the corner with wonderful wares including food jewelry scarves and other handmade items.  We had fresh croissants from this market for breakfast every morning.  Florence’s apartment gave us the feeling of being in a real French neighborhood.  Very highly recommend.

She gave us a useful tour and overview of the flat and there wasn't anything we were missing or unsure about over the next few days.

Absolutely perfect - I have been showing my friends the Airbnb pics to show off!"
17938025,276943539,2018-06-15,172629640,Karen,This Airbnb is stylishly a bit different and it should be noted you must go down the stairs to get to the common room showers.  Each shower has its separate room beyond the kitchen.  The location is so great and the neighborhood has so much to offer our group of 6 had an enjoyable stay at Mathilde’s place.

The location of the flat was really ideal and we were able to walk almost everywhere. The neighbourhood is very lively with a lot of good restaurants and shops. The flat itself is spacious well equipped has a great view and gets a lot of light! I would definitely stay here again.

3643714,413245402,2019-02-17,37768348,Liz,My boyfriend and I booked Céciles apartment for a weekend in Paris and it could not have been more perfect. Cécile was the perfect host and was able to accommodate a late check in for us. She sent lots of information in advance so that everything went smoothly on our arrival. The apartment is in a really nice location and is really close to the Metro line which gives you access to all over the city. We found it very easy to get around and see all the sites. We're even planning on coming back during the summer.
13077823,123464045,2016-12-29,4048864,Susan,Ghislain's flat was AMAZING! The area has many restaurants cafes and supermarkets and is a short walk from all of the wonderful things Montmartre has to offer. The flat is very cozy and has everything you need. Ghislain was very friendly and communicative and made our stay very comfortable. I highly recommend his flat for your Parisian holiday!

20988636,464712828,2019-06-06,208927804,Ray,"First time staying in an Airbnb outside of the US. It was exactly as we (my wife and I) hoped it would be. Christophe was very friendly and happy to help with our questions and recommendations. The view was worth every penny. His apartment is very clean and centrally located. I didn't realize Paris was so busy but that's the nature of the city. Beyond the standard ""must see"" places in Paris (Eiffel Tower Arc de Triomphe Louvre etc) I would highly recommend seeing the Sacre-Coeur (English translation is Sacred Heart). It's the cathedral visible from the apartment windows. Located on the top of the tallest hill in Paris offering an amazing view of the city. We went one night after dinner. The church is well lit at night and is simply breathtaking. During the day I'm certain you'd get a breathtaking view of the entire city of Paris. There's actually a platform directly in front of the church for taking pictures. Roughly a 15 euro uber ride. Oh and try to schedule your Uber rides around morning and evening rush hour. We noticed the pricing tends to double (or more) at those times. All in all I would confidently recommend Christophe's Airbnb to any friends or family interested in a Paris getaway."
30952420,502184032,2019-08-04,48310812,Matt,A Fun place to stay just 20-30 minutes metro from the Centre of Paris - great coffee included and options to be eco friendly and decline room service! Bar happy to fill waterbottles with chilled water anytime so we can stay hydrated in the summer heat!

1577747,72520018,2016-05-03,10731906,Stephanie,We absolutely loved our time in this apartment! Mehdi was so easy to communicate with about all the details and made the whole experience very seamless. The apartment is in --in my opinion--the perfect location in Paris on a quiet street but very close to all the fun parts of the Marais district. Make sure to get a reservation at Au Passage over on Saint Sebastien if you stay here. The place itself is typical of Parisian apartments (not huge but certainly equipped with everything you need) and the bed is super super comfortable! We looked forward to sleeping in it every night after long days of wandering. Also to note--we used the heater by the window on a few cold days and it was very effective. I've seen that others struggled with the shower but we loved it; had plenty of hot water for showers and the tub is very charming. Also very nice to have the closet for hanging up a few of our nicer clothes and the lovely windows for morning light. Great place! 
3454070,55128894,2015-11-28,9314105,Bauke And Annemiek,"Justine lives just on the border of my favorite Parisian neighbourhood: Canal St Martin. The appt is opposite to a lovely all they round Cafe Popote serving yummy breakfast from 7:30am and has a supermarket on the ground floor. Very convenient! Its 15 minutes walk from Gare Du Nord en has stops of the metro lines 4 ( Chateau D'Eau) and 5 (Jacques Bonsergeant) on a few minutes walk.
In the evening no need to take any transport; stroll down the rue de Lancry (restaurants) or the Rue de Marseille (boutiques) to the Canal st Martin area for some totally local joie de vivrex

The appt has all you need is warm enough and fits two pple max. 
It is on the 4th floor without lift so a nice workout.
Justine was super nice to let us check out very late which made our last day super comfortable.
Thanks Justine!"
22985492,278021614,2018-06-17,42979300,Tracy,While the overall cleanliness of the place can definitely be improved the price of the place was worth it given the close proximity to public transport. The neighbourhood is peaceful and quiet. There's a supermarket and tram station less than 5 minutes from the place. Clement was also easily reached when we had questions.

Handing out of the keys went very easily and smoothly and we had a good contact before I came to Paris. Christophe also suggested some places nearby to eat/drink and go out. Christophe provided towels and shampoo. There was also coffee nutella and chocolate for breakfast.

498891,254580472,2018-04-17,14040445,Melani,This was my first experience renting with Airbnb so I was quite nervous; however Umberto assuaged my fears with his quick replies information about the apartment & awesome tips about the area/ Paris.  The apartment was very clean & Umberto was kind enough to stock it with fresh fruit cookies and juice.  It’s conveniently located near several metro stops which will take you to any of Paris’ tourist attractions either directly or via a quick transfer.  Just around the corner you’ll find restaurants (Chez Janou across the street is delicious) patisseries & shops.  The location can’t be beat!  Only “issue” was climbing six flights of stairs at then end of a long day of sightseeing.  Be aware that these stairs are no joke!  It wasn’t a deal breaker for my husband & I - we found it got easier over time - and truthfully it probably helped burn calories from all the baguettes & cheese eaten throughout the day.  Overall fantastic experience; highly recommend.  Thanks Umberto!

Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Viertel mit ein paar kleinen Restaurants in der Nähe wenige Minuten entfernt von Metro und dem Zentrum des Viertels. In ein paar weiteren Minuten ist am oben auf dem Montmartre. Alle übrigen Entfernungen spielen für Metro-Fahrer/innen keine Rolle. Alles sehr empfehlenswert. Gerne wieder.

We had so much fun walking around the area and relaxing in the evenings at Bruno's studio. The studio is exactly as it appears in the photos and had everything we needed.

In addition to the studio Bruno was an incredible host. We lost our luggage and were delayed getting into Paris and he was so communicative thoughtful and generous with us. When we return to Paris we will definitely try to stay at Bruno's apartment again. Thank you for everything Bruno!!"

30952420,517000656,2019-08-25,178492772,Joanne,Very cute boutique hotel in a great location. The beds were comfy the shower was good and the staff were excellent very kind and helpful. We got a discounted price - not sure why it was double for 2 weeks later but the discount really upped the value of this hotel for us. We didn't visit the lounge area while it was open but it looked cute empty. The room had 2 twin beds side by side instead of a king which I didn't mind cauae my husband basically runs in his sleep so I didn't catch any of the bounce factor. Stay here you won't regret it!
30280965,430824057,2019-03-31,153562685,Amitty,Really enjoyed staying here. Spent most of the time exploring the city. Absolutely ideal locations close to so many amazing resturant and attractions. This part of town is definitely safe clean and where you want to stay.
786714,496192696,2019-07-27,41798951,Sarah Lee,"Excellent location! It is was to see why this host is a Super Host! Christine was so helpful from the time I arrived to the time i departed.  She responded in a timely manner and always found answers to my questions and requests.  

The apartment itself is in an historic building with a courtyard which offered quiet from the street noise - of which there is plenty because- after all - it’s Paris- the city that never sleeps.  I am an introvert who requires down time to recharge and this beautiful place offered that for me.

To top it off Paris experienced super hot weather- 108 degrees Fahrenheit was the highest temperature over a 4 day heat wave - hottest they’ve experienced in almost 50 years. This Super Host already had a portable air conditioner which was a life saver!  I was able to invite friends over for dinner instead of battling the heat! 
I woke up every morning in a fairytale environment and cafes and pastry shops all very close.

I highly recommend this AirBnB and will return again.

PS - it is on the top floor without an elevator so if you are in good physical condition ( or want to be) you will appreciate the work out."
8920689,535736957,2019-09-25,5919069,Karen,We loved this flat. It was in a great location. Neat and clean with lots of amenities. We would stay there again. Just a note the flat is smaller then you see in the photos. There is a Murphy bed and in some of the photos it is folded up.
1315879,422836709,2019-03-12,12357554,Ryan,Room was nice and had a great view of the Eiffel Tower at night. The location isn’t exactly in Montmartre but close enough to walk too. Very close to Gare du Nord
21442372,352519090,2018-11-25,103314897,Laura,Luciles Appartment is a cozy little one bedroom appartment that is just enough for a short trip to Paris. We were able to get to the center of the city super fast and everything necessary (grocery wize) is right around the corner. So if you fancy a practical stay in Paris this is a good address.

6978581,86235183,2016-07-15,43905663,Kathy,We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful apartment. Lovely apartment that is modern but still has that Paris charm-super clean and has everything you need. I slept on the fold out couch which was easy to fold up and down and really comfy. This apartment is a 5min walk from Gare d'lest metro station. The area had some lovely wee shops and plenty of bars and restaurants . There was a wee supermarket just around the corner and one across the canal. I would stay here again and would recommend to anyone looking for lovely clean apartment whilst exploring Paris.

29702398,467152801,2019-06-10,222851975,Ursula,The flat is in a very good and central location. It's just a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame and with the Metro line 1 (just 5 minutes walk away) you get everywhere you want to. The neighbourhood is nice with a lot of small shops and restaurants allover. Climbing the stairs into the 5th floor is a bit tiring (especially if you have big baggage to carry as we did) but you know it before when booking so just to get used to it when there! The only slight negative point is that there is a quite nasty smell coming from the bathroom - not possible to get away with the airconditioning or anything.  We were a family with 2 children - so it was quite cosy in the two-room flat but we weren't staying a lot in there and for sleeping it was ok - also the sofa was ok. Over all it's a nice flat in a very good location for a short stay.
22350013,506907672,2019-08-11,93439187,Robert,Overall it was decent. Very small as described and it gets very musty if you don’t air it out. Thankfully there was a window and a fan in the apartment. Also all the hallway lights in the buildings were on timers when we were there so you need to turn on lights in the building as you go. We weren’t expecting this so it was a little disorienting for us. It’s an old slightly sketchy building but the location is very nice-a couple minutes from great views of the Eiffel Tower.
2434417,22739452,2014-11-13,5080560,Kelly,Our stay at Orelie's was great! The apartment is quite spacious and in a fantastic location in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Paris. It was a short walk from the metro and felt like a safe area to walk around in even at night. It was also just a very short walk from the stunning Sacre Couer! Orelie was able to give us some great restaurant recommendations and left us some information about things to do on the counter for our stay. Thanks Orelie!

They also had lovely breakfast and information on how to stay safe in the city. The distance to city center areas is about 20 minutes by public transportation. Anytime we had a question about anything Jeff would help us out which was nice because we were two clueless Americans haha. Our first airbnb experience: success!!! Hope to see you guys next time you're in California!

105210,7391783,2013-09-18,6795556,Cynthia,We stayed in Michel's apartment from Sept 13 - 17 and really enjoyed our time there. It was my first experience using Air bnb and going to Paris and I could not have asked for a friendlier host. The apartment was very spacious and centrally located. There is a metro stop right outside the apartment but we rarely had to use it as everything was within walking distance. I highly recomment Michel and his apartment!

The location is perfect with one of the best districts right on your doorstep. Seconds away from amazing boutiques and restaurants and short walk from a number of metro stations.  

The flat itself is great a classic building with amazing views across Paris from every window. Clean comfortable and cool decor. This place is perfect for a real Parisian experience! "

60165,19410573,2014-09-12,17241591,Ashley,"This is my first time booking with airbnb and thanks to Aurélie the house owner me and my two colleagues had a comfortable stay in Paris. We didn’t have the change to meet Aurélie at check-in nor at check out. Instead we met her friend Stephane who gave us a nice welcome at check-in and her brother and mom who wished us for the best at check-out. Aurélie is a very responsible house owner. She kindly answered all our questions before our trip. 
If you’re about to make a reservation here are some facts that might be in help. 
<< House conditions >>
The house looks exactly like the photos. Pretty clean! Both the bed and the sofa bed are comfortable. The space is just enough for 3 of us because we come on a business trip and we all have large-piece luggages. Elevator is small but very convenient. Kitchen is equipped with all we needed for making meals. It’s very kind of Aurélie that she let us use basic spices/sauces. A bit noise at night but it didn’t bother us at all. 
<< Transportation >>
1 minute walk to station Château Rough on Metro Line 4. Just 2 stations away from the mega transfer staion Gare du Nord which connected to REB B to CDG airport. There’s an upward escalator in Château Rough. (Note: No downward escalator or elevator.)
<< Neighborhood>>
The area Château Rough is known as “Little Africa of Paris.” Your comfort level will have to depend on your knowledge and your perception of the African race. The beautiful Montmartre and Sacre Coeur is just near by. Definitely a big plus for fabric lovers because a big textile market is only a few steps away from Sacre Coeur. There is a small traditional market just next to the Château Rough station. A big Carrefour supermarket in 5 minutes walk.

25510816,289909951,2018-07-13,193496105,Chris,"Excellent communication and arrival logistics.
Not the quietest of locations but very handy for the Gare de Nord or Gare d'est"
21861761,539919675,2019-10-02,13470039,Asher,Liudmila's place is in a fantastic location - you are really paying for this.  We wanted something handy for Châtelet les Halles train station and great restaurants and sights and this was perfect for that. As the listing acknowledges it is really small and dark and it is also very warm so I wouldn't stay for longer than 2 nights or if you wanted to eat in etc. All in all it was fine for a short stay when the priority was being out and about.

3430957,544488013,2019-10-10,2644251,Cindy And Steve,This is a very basic apartment in a fabulous location in a great neighborhood and has just enough to make it an enjoyable stay.  Do not expect luxury - just a clean accommodating place to stay with a wonderful bed that is in a wonderful place with a few amenities that make it much better than a hotel!
24198358,367259562,2019-01-04,177858188,Oliver,The only good thing was the location. Dead mouse behind the curtains dirty socks in the corner of the bath dirty dishes hair in the dishes. At least the bed had clean sheets. And unfortunately the host gave us the wrong code of the Key-Box. I dislocated my shoulder at 3 am by night in the corridor and there were obviously noise compliants by the neighbors because of the ambulance etc. and the only thing the host had to say about that the other night was: so hopefully it will not happen again tonight.

2559377,160207036,2017-06-13,30233707,Kimberly,Anne's apartment was cute and comfortable.  Shower was leaking and she apologized that someone couldn't repair during our stay.  We worked around it.  Toilet not in bathroom (Website hidden by Airbnb) separate space which was basically a closet with the cleaning supplies.  Apartment very close to Metro and in a lovely neighborhood with good food nearby.  We loved Jolie Boheme on corner Les Deux Freres for pastries & sandwiches and the fruit market across the street from bakery.  Anne thoughtfully left coffee juice milk and bread for us.  She was also very sweet in offering to help with travel arrangements such as train schedules and taxi service (we used Uber instead).  Paris flat good value in safe area.  Would recommend.
1266367,271121426,2018-05-31,159868265,Ariel,The place is lovely. Safe and close to the metro. Big enough for 5 people. We recommed it .

3305819,43606887,2015-08-21,2911370,Catherine,"Quelques jours avant mon arrivée Noémie m'a contactée par téléphone pour me donner des renseignements pratiques concernant l'appartement. J'ai apprécié le sérieux de Noémie et son organisation. Étant absente pour me donner les clefs et pour les récupérer elle a délégué cette tâche à une de ses amies qui a été ponctuelle et très chaleureuse. De même j'ai pu récupérer et rendre les clefs à des horaires très souples c'est à dire en fonction de mes horaires de train. 
L'appartement est très sympathique et idéalement situé. On peut Accéder à la plupart des musées des monuments des salles de spectacles des grands magasins à pied. Super!
En prime deux stations de métro sont proches dont une à deux minutes de l'appartement et conduisant directement à la Gare de Lyon .
En résumé j'ai passé un très agréable séjour.

9973179,224121172,2018-01-02,79976211,Arthur,Location location location! The location of the apartment is fantastic close to everything. Subway station a few steps from the apartment. In front of the George Pompidou Centre. Supermarkets bars restaurants everything nearby. Easy to walk everywhere. The studio is a little bit smaller than I expected but faithful to the photos. The sofabed was unconfortable. The bed was great.
1360002,36702399,2015-06-30,19746239,Hong,Amina's apartment was like her photos. It was near metro station. It was 20 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower. Amina was not in Paris but her brother here and everything in order. Amina was easily reachable via AirBnB/e-mail. Overall it was a great living experience in Paris.

23619263,306118144,2018-08-12,4317001,Randall,We had a great time at JM's place. It's a lot of stairs to climb but definitely well worth it. The terrace is super cute and we loved hanging out on it. The entire apartment is pretty spacious but still cozy-feeling. The AC was definitely nice to have. The area had a lot of cool bars restaurants and shops and there are lots of transportation options. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!

22683026,456705605,2019-05-22,154028491,Supichayanthip,"Good place. 
Good location 
Bad check in process (maybe because it was late and the girl who had to welcome us wanted to hang out with her friends but still) 
Be aware is you have a big luggage it could be a probleme to take it upstair.
The shower is often overflowing so you need to take you socks out to enter inside

Otherwise i would recommend this place which is cosy and nice in a great area. 
Futhermore the owner provide nice soap and shampoo sample on your arrival (like in hotels) which is nice. 
Clean place too 
We didnt try to cook because you kitchen is near the bed so not ideal if you want to cook. Maybe the microwave could have an oven mode and it would be a perfect kitchen. 

Id like to add that there is plenty of power supply outlet which is perfect.
Internet is good.

I guess the hot water is shared in the building and obviously not illimited as i had 2 cold shower during my 3 nights stay"
12625271,81618748,2016-06-24,77099014,Juliette,L'appartement est très agréable très bien équipé et proche de plusieurs moyens de transport ce qui est très pratique. Merci beaucoup pour ce séjour !

2765864,28786855,2015-03-30,12031902,Brian,"My wife and I stayed on Hervé and Vittoria's houseboat for a long weekend at the end of March. They were gracious hosts with Vittoria working with us to reschedule after an emergency cancellation and Hervé meeting us at the boat and giving us all the information we needed about the accommodation and the area. 

The living space is the former captain's cabin that is now set up as a comfortable if not particularly fancy living space. It really is easy walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. We bought a two-day Batobus pass that gave us easy access to eight popular destinations along the Seine from the Eiffel Tower stop. The river is alive with large tour boats and cargo boats and it was fun to watch them from the houseboat and the deck of the Batobus. There is also easy access to the RER train system.

One important thing to note is that this would be a challenging accommodation for the physically impaired. Access to the cabin is through a hatchway down a steep ladder and the bathtub/shower combo also requires a climb. If you're in OK shape it's all part of the adventure.  The living space itself was compact but well laid out and scrupulously clean."
3445515,292135844,2018-07-17,3901951,Tania,"The location of this apartment is perfect for anyone wanting to stay close to the Seine with an easy walk to a Notre Dame and the amazing variety of wonderful restaurants in the Latin Quarter. This apartment met all of our needs for our two week stay. We cooked many dinners in the apartment and it has the basics for some simple meals.  There is a great place for fresh bread just a 2 minute walk up the street as well as an inexpensive pizza take-out not far either. There is also two grocery stores nearby as well. If you go down to the Seine in the evening you can picnic and there is usually people playing music and some dancing. There is a fan and a hairdryer for guests to use as well.  We found leaving a window open in the evening was refreshing for sleeping.  There is also a laundromat just a few blocks away that we used instead of the washer in the apartment. We did this so we didn’t need to buy a large bottle of laundry soap and as we were 4 people it was a bit too much to hang to dry. (You can get individual load portioned soap $0.50 at the laundromat) instructions are in French and English as well on the wall at the laundromat. 
There is a clothes drying hanging rack that hooks on top of the large storage doors for your clothes to dry though if needed. 
Frederic was very friendly and always available for us. He was very polite and willing to help with our questions. Both check-in and check-out were extremely easy. We would definitely stay here again if we return back to Paris."
13272503,255614721,2018-04-21,162598185,Wendy,Charming spacious apartment in the heart of the Marais. Close proximity to great restaurants cafes boulangeries market etc.. On a sunny day I recommend grabbing lunch at the open air market and picnicking at nearby Elie Wiesel park.
3332449,133391958,2017-02-22,53794416,Alexandre,Christine's place is quite convenient as close to many public transportation. The flat is also very comfortable with large rooms a real bathroom and a real kitchen with space to cook. Check-in and check-out were made easy and communication with Christine was very prompt.
11298690,137937229,2017-03-18,20309173,Anya,"On our first trip to Paris my family was lucky enough to enjoy the gem of an apartment located a short walk from the Eiffel Tower. The apartment was conveniently located to an number of produce stores cafes and the metro. The place was cozy quiet and most importantly clean. It was a great home away from home while we were enjoying our stay in Paris. It was a real authentic experience to live in apartment like a Parisian. Every morning and every night we would walk by the plaza which had an amazing view of Eiffel Tower (it only takes about 5 mins to get to that plaza to see the Eiffel Tower and about 15 minute walk to get to the base of it).
 
Dani has been an AMAZING host! He has been the most hospitable and accommodating person we’ve met.  He has contacted me immediately after booking and was available non-stop via (Hidden by Airbnb) for any questions my family and I had and we had a lot of questions since it was our first time in Paris. He helped us to plan how to get from airport to his flat by giving couple transportation options. When we arrived he met us at the bus station and helped with all of our luggage to take upstairs to his apartment. He even left us some nice snacks and drinks (tea coffee water juice wine). He even gave us tickets to see the Opera House (beautiful building!) and a cruise on river Seine. Plus he was able to get us discounted tickets to the Louvre!! Throughout our stay he would text us in the morning and in the evening to check if we had any questions or needed any help. He even made dinner reservations for us when we needed to do that. This experience with Dani was so personable and warm we highly recommend him as a Host! "

One thing that was missing was a TV; we made do with a tablet but others may find this insight helpful when booking.
It has a recently renovated bathroom with a large shower (but no bath)."

On arrival there were snacks and water left out. The bathroom was very clean and there was some space in the fridge for a few items . It was a great base to see the sights from. "
55071,467350585,2019-06-10,221493265,Tom,Marion’s apartment really is lovely - stylish eclectic comfortable with everything you might need and a super-comfortable bed.  It’s a great location very convenient for exploring Paris and there are great restaurants within 50 meters in every direction: the Italian Il Cuoco Galante (opposite the gate of the side-street in which the apartment is located) is outstanding.  Within 50 meters there’s also a nice bar (probably more than one) and at least one supermarket.  Marion was very helpful and quick to respond to all our queries and the check-in could not have been easier.  Overall we would highly recommend this delightful place!
6178282,64479152,2016-03-04,60683641,Jason,Catherine welcomed me with a treat from my long trip and chatted a bit about the apartment and all the amenities. She showed me how the keys worked and which doors were for each. She showed me to my room and explained the heater Wi-Fi TV and the shower with its different color combinations.! Shampoo soap and towels were all provided. There was a small kettle with some assorted coffees to use and a britta water filter in the room. Breakfest was great since it was available from 7 to 11 your choice. Catherine provided much from cereal hard boiled eggs to toast tea and the like. Really helped get me going in the morning. My room had stunning views overlooking the Ave de Wagram and you could see the Arc de Triomphe down the street. Overall a beautiful stay close to the RATP. Thanks Catherine next time I visit Paris It'll be with you again! Merci Beaucoup!

- posizione favorevole
- bagno piccolissimo soffocante Ma appena rifatto con buona doccia.

- host disorganizzato: ciccato completamente orario check in (si presenta 3 ore prima degli accordi) quindi non si presenta più
- fornitura di salviette imbarazzante: 1 a testa!!! e a specifica richiesta di integrazione chiede soldi!!!
- sofà della sala sporco e tagliato
- frigor rotto con allarme fastidioso che non si spegne

13245209,93029797,2016-08-11,64563725,Mary Jo,Our stay in Paris was amazing and a lot had to do with staying at Sebastien's lovely and incredibly located apartment. Truly located in the heart of St. Germain de Près it overlooks Deux Magots Café Flore and Brasserie Lipp. This is a very active neighbor but this is a very QUIET apartment! It was beautiful having this birdsseye view of this so famous area of Paris.

18609786,240086483,2018-03-04,158810825,Olivia,We had the most amazing stay at this apartment. As five girls we used Uber's to get around everywhere which we found to be very reasonable and we felt we were no more than 10 minutes from everything we wanted to see and do in Paris. We felt the location was very safe and this was our primary concern as a group of five girls. Not only was the decor of the apartment exceptional but it was beautifully clean. Pat & Hag were very attentive with their communication and made it clear we could contact them at anytime however they are so thorough with the information they give and the apartment is so perfect we didn't feel the need to contact them for anything. Would definitely stay again when visiting Paris. Pure perfection.

The apartment was clean when we got to it. We knew there was no AC but were shocked to not even find a desk fan seeing that summer gets SO hot. There was also a lack of linens - due to the heat my guest and I decided to sleep one on the sofa and one on the bed but the only sheets in the entire apartment were on the bed. But these are small issues - the apartment altogether is in a great location!

Nous avons été accueillies par Damian l'ami de Matt car celui ci était en voyage il a été très sympathique et arrangeant sur les heures d'arrivée et de départ.

It's safe in a great location well furnished spotlessly clean and OOZING Parisian charm!!  Yes it's dinky but there's nothing missing that you'd need and the views from the window are stunning!

Sacré Couer is within easy walking distance but there are also a couple of Metro stations very close by.  It's a well connected place even though you feel like you're living amongst the locals and Montmartre itself is of course a great place to be based.

Audrey was great with me from start to finish - with prompt and helpful communication and a friendly face to greet me when I arrived too.

Highly recommended - I'll be coming straight back here next time!"

Eric met us at the apartment and showed us howeverything worked.   The door was a little bit tricky to open but once we gotthe hang of it  it was fine.  There is also a secure door (code required) out to the street so it's very safe.  We could notfigure out how to get out the first time we triedto leave which was pretty comical!  At the end ofour stay Eric met us again and we wereable to leave our luggagein the shop downstairs to have our last day in Paris before catching the train back to London.

8880925,442380410,2019-04-23,66630406,Amy,"This is the second time I stayed at Jean-Michel's home as it is an exceptional value! His apartment is in the epicenter of everything you could want to experience; walking distance to all attractions in Paris and the subway. His home is beautiful and he thoughtfully provides all the amenities and thoughtful little splurges in your room. Additionally Jean-Michel provides exceptional hospitality! He personally helped me to get from La Gare Nord both inbound and outbound on my trip! That was above and beyond what I expected and was sincerely appreciated. He also made french press coffee for me every morning. 

His home is beautiful and there is a lovely garden you can walk through immediately at the entrance to his flat. Book Jean-Michel's home for your next stay in Paris you will be glad you did!"
16713561,181786065,2017-08-13,137602730,Julia,Bright clean apartment which has everything for life. Perfect location you can safely stroll to many of the sights of Paris. Katarina was nice and helpful and communicated well with us too. Noise in the mornings from cleaning the streets and delivery to restaurants downstairs caused a small inconvenience but it allowed to feel like a resident and not a guest of this beautiful city. I recommend this place travelers who want to live like Parisians.

26153639,149440394,2017-05-04,24327596,Klara,Communication and service at the hostel were great very helpful and friendly. The room and bathroom were very clean. Though not in the central tourist part of Montmatre I really liked the immediate area it was lively and close to the Metro. I can recommend staying here if you are on a very low budget but would still like to live centrally in Paris.
3470187,73411581,2016-05-08,6198393,Tatiana,L'appartamento corrisponde alle immagini e alle descrizioni. Tutto era pulito e funzionante. Si trova in un quartiere animato e vicino alla fermata della metro. Denis e la sua famiglia sono stati molto gentili e disponibili sia prima che durante il viaggio. Abbiamo trovato tutto il necessario e degli utili consigli lasciati dall'host. Ci siamo sentiti come a casa nostra! La nostra bimba ha apprezzato molto la sua camera e i giochi a disposizione. La notte l'appartamento è silenzioso e si dorme bene. Un'esperienza da ripetere!
17938025,536147889,2019-09-26,113124445,Katia,The best location you could have ! The apartment it’s so big and nice. The check in it’s so easy. Definitely recommend for a big groups.

5392048,241460705,2018-03-09,9377678,Natalia,Спасибо Эмили! Все было замечательно! Тихо комфортно метро близко кровать хорошая! Очень хороший обогреватель ночью было жарко и открывали окно очень тихо и ничего не мешало выспаться! Эмили быстро реагировала на Сообщения были вопросы с вай-фай (мы не могли поверить что комбинация из миллиона цифр и букв это и есть пароль.. но для Парижский квартир это нормально оказалось). Сама Эмили очень приветливая и обаятельная приехала проводить нас. Когда заезжали она оставила бутылку воды мелочь но не думаешь после самолёта что нужно бежать в магазин и сразу по пути что-то покупать. Потолки в кв низкие мы знали это но это прям особый шарм! Кухня вполне оборудована. Туалет с душем маленький-но тоже мне кажется это мелочь. Возможно посоветовала бы добавить шампунь/гель для душа. Что касается душа - помните об экономии воды в кв бойлер не большой. Замки и в кв и на вход - обязательно закрывать! Не просто захлопнуть в именно закрыть!! Стоит учесть что кв находится в довольно интересном месте (доме) у неё отдельный вход и есть маленькая лестница! Этакий квест) для туристов с большими чемоданами может быть не очень комфортно подниматься а для туристов с рюкзаком - вполне отлично! Thank you Emilie!!!
37530571,533194066,2019-09-21,118853055,Ju,Nice appartment to stay in for a while in Paris. Not in the center but easy to reach. Nice host and nice neighbour who let us in. WLan only from the retirement across the street which was low quality. Forgot my sunglasses but it was no problem to pick them up a few days later. After I got Sharif's number it was a super easy communication. Really friendly.

24042119,493149286,2019-07-22,97782662,민서,에펠탑과 걸어서 15분 정도 거리에 있어요. 주변에 마트와 빨래방도 있어서 좋아요. Jeff와 소통도 잘된답니다:)
13012912,235267567,2018-02-16,132459567,Brian,"Perfectly quiet location clean and warm. Very secure in an interesting area with local bars and restaurants especially recommend the family run Au Chien Qui Fume very good food wonderful service and not too expensive.
The flat is placed near 2 Metro stations but is an easy walk to central area such as The Eiffel Tower.
Would book again."
2884300,29843171,2015-04-13,3834402,Carmen,Marianne was a lovely and helpful host! Her flat ist really nice well equipped and situated just around the corner of the Louvre in a very lively street with nice cafes restaurants and bars. Marianne gave us a warm welcome and was very kind - she even stored our lugguage on the day of departure. I can highly recommend her as a host!
23513578,421012672,2019-03-08,25097080,Анастасия,we liked everything very much: The apartment is clean and bright the location is beyond praise and all this for reasonable price. Special thanks to Magda for help in solving all domestic issues as well as for a warm welcome and the possibility of a later check out.
6643563,114288322,2016-11-17,37197883,Daniel,La ubicación es mas que perfecta a un minuto de la estación de st Paul y por ella puedes ir al centro rápido el único detalle es que faltó comunicación cin el anfitrión sólo lo vi al llegar y hay cosas que jamás supimos como que el baño tenía un secador de ropa o como utilizar el wifi ya que en París es un box y fue confuso el lugar es lo que se muestra en las fotos nos ayudó a subir las maletas los 5 pisos eso es muy bueno la vista es buena la terraza cómoda y lugar en general claro que volveré esta genial sólo los detalles de la comunicación pero mi inglés no es muy bueno así que puede ser detalle mío. 
15433310,301436596,2018-08-04,189382547,Brianna,"The location was great. It was right in front of a Metro station on the 7 line which has direct access to a lot of the major sites like the Louvre. I even walked along the Seine to the Louvre area which took about 30 minutes. 

The space itself was clean and comfortable and had everything I needed. I was able to use the kitchen and refrigerator freely. The room was on the first floor with a window facing the street but it was a quieter side street so I didn't have any problems with noise.

I only meet Timothée but he was kind and friendly and spoke near-perfect English. I felt very welcomed. Highly recommended :)"
8253932,65136550,2016-03-11,23315243,John,Thiane was wonderful.  Her daughter and son-in-law checked us in an out so we never got to meet Thiane but she kept in touch was very gracious and she was very concerned with our happiness.  She keeps a binder with maps and instructions and points of interest in the apartment which is great for first time visitors.  Everything in the apartment works fine.  We appreciated the spices that were left for our use.
4641425,26028479,2015-02-01,5788958,Sargis,Appartement charmant et confortable bien placé (transports commerces ...) ! Très bon accueil! 
371862,51737687,2015-10-24,3647643,Christiana,"We had a very nice stay in this charming Parisian flat. It has it's signs of fair wear and tear with some raw elements such as the ground floor. But those details make it even more charming and combined with a very stylish design furniture it makes this place unique. 

The kitchen is very well equipped and we loved sitting at the kitchen table and have this great view into the trees outside by the huge window. 

If you want to experience the real Parisian live you are at the right place. The area 'Sainte Marthe' just in front of the house Canal Saint Martin Buttes Chaumont Parc de la Viellette are just some places where you won't find mass tourism. But still the touristic areas are not far away if you want to go there. 

We can recommend the dinner in the 'Flat Iron' in Rue Sainte-Marthe. 

We would like to come back in the summer when we can use the little private terrace outside :-) "
790431,335102705,2018-10-11,146099235,Jessica,"I really had a great stay at Patricias place. 
She just speaks french but communication is also possible with just some words of french. The important things about check-out and breakfast she translated in english. 
Communication with the daughter is pretty easy and good (about the messager AirBnB).

The place is very clean and everything you need is there. 
You even have breakfast (café tea Croissant baguette and jam).
You can get easy to all the sightseeings by metro - the metrostation Montgallet is just some minutes away.

I really recommend this place.

Thank you :)"
28147916,331676701,2018-10-03,31655105,Frank,Although the host was very friendly we do not recommend her loft mainly due to the absence of a decent bed and normal size towels. We had to sleep 5 days on a very hard matras and dry ourselves with very small towels  .Price/Value relation is disproportional
537443,52175218,2015-10-26,7181753,Callo,Great location! Very functional studio JJ was an excellent host totally recomended
957896,333518219,2018-10-07,145229446,David,Romain provided a comfortable very clean and stylish apartment with a great location in Montmartre.  We would definitely stay here again!
336904,528513762,2019-09-13,394758,Michael,"Aki was wonderful! I have visited Japan almost ten times as I live in Seoul...I have done many a weekend trip have tried all the basic foods but never had I done a tour or a standing bar. Also this time I was traveling solo so I definitely wanted someone to take me out and show me a new area.  I am an adventurous eater and I wanted to try stuff outside of the usual okonmiyaki takoyaki....generic.....and Aki's offering's were not generic.

Aki's tour did this: prime evening hours 7-10 standing bars (somewhere you usually can't go on your own or just walk in and know what to do without language skills). She was outgoing friendly managed our group of three well. We left as friends and I truly hope she comes visits in Seoul!

She did teach us some of the language basics which actually I had never taken the time to learn in all my visits. She encourages you to try to order which honestly really helps you just feel more comfortable going everywhere else later on your own."
9851851,463456608,2019-06-03,11744137,Eric,Great apartment close to Gare de Lyon for trains metro and airport bus. Self check-in made arriving and leaving super easy.  We were very comfortable and had no issues. Would happily rebook if we return to Paris.

Mary Laure was always quick with responses to out questions and helped us a lot with our stay in Paris. It was great we would not hesitate to come again."
8588267,447772300,2019-05-04,160632316,Heidi,Perfect location close to the metro restaurants and many Paris attractions. The apartment was perfect and made us feel like locals for a few days. We had everything we needed and more. The apartment is fall of lovely quirky touches. Gisela always answered promptly with directions and plenty of cafe/restaurant suggestions.
4080071,483233910,2019-07-07,139545288,Elizabeth,I can’t say enough good things about Kate and Oliver’s beautiful apartment. The location is perfect a fantastic neighborhood full of history yet completely hip. Great restaurants all within a few blocks. Ten minute walk to Notre Dame close to subway lines and trains. The apartment is fantastic—you’re in a home not just a “place to put your suitcase”. Highly recommend going down to the Seine in the evening get a beer from one of the riverside restaurants and hang out with locals. Great time in Paris great apartment great hosts!
36499193,505243428,2019-08-09,138683068,Reez,Fuyez cet appartement . D énormes traces de dégâts de moisissure sont cachées derrière les fausses tapisseries . La chambre est donc catastrophique et TRÈS touchée . Tout l appartement sent la moisissure comme le salon aussi .  Remboursement intégral suite a cette mauvaise expérience . La cordialité de l hôte ne change en rien ses mensonges et sa fausse surprise .
476307,5053963,2013-06-10,3367054,Nelly,"L'appartement est au pied de plusieurs stations de métro et la plus proche est à peine 50 mètres. L'immeuble est sécurisé et se situe dans une seconde cours ce qui lui permet d'être au calme. 
Nous y avons passé un agréable séjour et Tania est une hôte attentionnée qui a su se rendre disponible pour la remise des clés. Enfin les enfant y ont retrouvé leur compte et demandent déjà quand nous reviendrons dans cette maison (les jouets de Baptiste et Gaspard ont été très appréciés)."

29879074,508026337,2019-08-12,35127525,Aaron,The space itself was wonderful! Claire was very communicative and quick to respond. My only tips are make sure there are two rolls of toilet paper and if you have bags you should know it’s a 5 floor walk up. There are no elevators so it is not handicapped accessible. It took me a while to get up the stairs with my cane not Claire’s fault at all I should have asked. Overall if I were to come back to Paris again I would look to see if this place was available again.

It rocks on the waves when the boats cruise by on the river. Uber is the best way to get into town but you can walk over the near by bridge to groceries and cafes. 
Gaëlle made it very easy to check in and out and stayed in touch via the AirBnB app.
We highly recommend this stay.

10515587,415232111,2019-02-22,50467275,Presilla,Gilian's place was such a great end to our trip! All I have to say is location location location! We didn't expect how lively the nightlife was around us and how central the location was to everything we wanted to see and experience. We felt safe and had all the necessary amenities inside Gilian's place. Communication and the check-in was smooth and open throughout the whole trip. We'd definitely stay at Gilian's place the next time we are in Paris!
7663270,64655213,2016-03-06,22527726,Shannon,We had a brilliant stay at the appartment. Great location right next to the the metro and bars/ restaurants near by.

17877471,442290384,2019-04-23,240240237,Jennifer,This is a great apartment in Marais.  It is situated on a great street with lots of shops a supermarket and plenty of restaurants.  The apartment is modern clean and very comfortable.  The hosts are excellent in communicating and making sure you have everything you will need while staying with them.  As a family of 6 this apartment met all of our needs.  Our teenage girls loved staying in the room on the lower level - endearingly referred to as the cave.  The kitchen was well equipped there were plenty of tvs and the bathrooms were great.  Would highly recommend this apartment to others.

1070274,345867767,2018-11-06,13227045,Oscar,Pascal’s charming flat is delightful. From the stunning views of Paris ideal location the full spectrum of amenities and personal touches and the ways in which he insures the comfort and well being of his guests I think it’s the perfect place to stay. He personally checked us in explained how to use the appliances and household items provided tips on transportation and what to do and see in the area and booked a taxi for my wife and I the day we departed. Our interactions with him were timely and met our needs in every possible way. I have no doubt that you will have a wonderful experience with Pascal should you elect to stay with him.

The host provided every conceivable amenity and even thoughtfully included a converter so we could charge our American devices. Alexander met me when I arrived and carried my suitcase for me.  He was also there in 10 minutes when I managed to lock myself out on a Saturday afternoon.
We had a fabulous time and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
23532642,293284737,2018-07-20,13428155,Rachel,Avril's place is spacious and felt like a home away from home. It is in a lovely neighbourhood opposite a stunning park but with easy access into the tourist spots via the metro. The place is clean and well-equipped. Our two daughters loved playing with all the toys. Because it was hot we left the window open but then decided to shut them because of street noise. Other than this we loved our stay here and would love to stay again.

6268747,340540673,2018-10-24,5203095,Tania,My husband baby and I stayed in Christian's apartment for 3 weeks and had a wonderful stay. Christian has great taste and the apartment is full of interesting books and is really nicely furnished. We also found all the appliances to be of the highest standard so that everything works really well. It was also great having a shower separate to the bathroom and having the parent's room on the other side of the apartment is really practical when you have a baby! The apartment has windows on three sides which look over lovely gardens and it's also very quiet. The location is good too with lots of handy buses and trains and a super convenient local shopping area plus there is a regular open air market.  We would highly recommend Christian's apartment to anyone especially people with children.
6541176,139995414,2017-03-27,22758494,Mark,The apartment is even better in real life than in the pictures. Everything about this stay was perfect. Nanda is extremely friendly and helpful and replied to our messages and questions almost immediately. The apartment is perfect for couples and also for anyone with young children. There are toys available for little ones which was great for our 1 year old. The location is absolutely perfect. Just a couple of minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and the River and many restaurants on the doorstep. We will return as soon as we can.
26415455,318036373,2018-09-03,1571090,Deirdre,Immaculately clean apartment in a great quartier. The beds were comfortable  there was everything we needed to cook with and the dining room was light filled and lovely. Apartment was very quiet but there is a school downstairs  which may get noisy during the day ( we were there in August so school was closed ). The neighborhood  is great a family friendly place between hipster Batignolles and the Étoile .

14707391,146214529,2017-04-22,103827663,Valentina,Прекрасная квартира. Полностью оборудованная. Но предназначена скорее для двух человек: в спальне очень удобная кровать диванчик в другой комнате (для сна) твердый.  Очень тихий дом. Спокойный район. В торговом центре напротив дома большой супермаркет. До метро буквально пара минут. Но мы пользовались в основном автобусами - очень удобно советуем.  София - очень милая и гостеприимная хозяйка. По договоренности с нею мы заселились немного раньше и в день выезда квартира была к нашим услугам до вечера. Мы бы очень  советовали квартиру Софии всем своим знакомым и будем рассматривать как вариант для последующих своих поездок. Большое спасибо София! Très bel appartement. Entièrement équipé. Mais il est plutôt conçu pour deux personnes: le lit dans la chambre est très confortable le canapé dans l'autre chambre (pour dormir) est dur. Le maison et l'endroit sont très tranquilles. Le centre commercial se trouve en face d'un grand supermarché. Le métro est à côté de le centre commercial à la Place d'Italie. Mais nous avons apprécié le plus souvent des buses - très pratique nous vous conseillons. Sofia est une hôtesse très chaleureusemente. Avec elle nous avons réglé que nous avons pu emménager dans l'appartement tôt le matin et - quand nous avons dû partir - était à l'hôtel jusqu'au soir. Nous vous conseillons l'appartement de Sofia. Merci beaucoup Sofia!

23840529,528102827,2019-09-12,148966879,Mathilde,Great apartment in Paris. Close to metro  which is handy best to study a map before hand. My partner is 6f and the bathroom was a struggle for him. I was aware that the place was small so it was to be expected. Unfortunately the beds where so uncomfortable- personal opinion ofcourse. However Communication and hospitality was amazing he let us into his place when we arrived early in Paris and a friend of his was super welcoming and told us everything we needed to know for our stay. Overall happy with our experience and would recommend

아주 만족스러운 숙소였어요
걸어서 에펠탑 가기에도 좋은 위치에 있고
역이랑도 가까워서 여행하는 동안 편했어요

숙소에 있을건 다 있고 사진이랑 거의 똑같았어요 ㅎ 다만 지내는데 불편함은 없었지만 약간의 방음이 부족한 점은 있었네요ㅎ
집주인 Martine 이 매우 친절해서 궁금한 점이나 어려움이 있으면 바로 도움 주실거예요 
파리에 있는동안 비가와서 아쉬웠지만 만족스러운 여행이었어요"

2024760,189980015,2017-09-03,4584051,Penelope,Mathilde & Matthieu's apartment is a great place to stay in this part of town. Large windows opening on to the big trees in the central courtyard give a special feel to the living area. Comfortable couch is a big plus too. Matthieu was really easy to contact when we had a bit of jet lag trouble using the keys. Comfortable bed & everything we needed in the kitchen including a stove top coffee maker. I  would definitely come back to Mathilde & Matthieu's and recommend it to others.

Timothée était disponible et prévenant il fourni quelques conseils sur le quartier et reste disponible en cas de question.
Merci"
781330,35833715,2015-06-22,4848616,Marla,"Our host met us to introduce us to the unit. Unfortunately the building itself was in disrepair . We did not feel the neighborhood was safe and the tutorial on how to work things was 45 minutes. In order to use the shower you need to turn on the water heater and then turn on a fan at certain times and in a certain order. The door has no handle on the outside  . We were also asked to sign a 4 page document agreeing with all of these rules. This is not our idea of a vacation get away. 
We did not stay and had to rent a hotel nearby."
1655556,44403430,2015-08-26,28325220,Pawel,Location location location. This place is a great spot in Paris. You have access to 2 different Metro spots which take you to all the sites in Paris. Shops are down the street literally 2 minute walk and the property is very secure. The host was absolutely lovely and explained everything and the parking wasn't too hard to find once we picked up our rentals. I highly recommend this place. The property is old as it is an old building so expect it to make a bit of noise I will definitely rent it again when I go back to Paris.

The flat is really charming and comfortable and the location is fabolous in an interesting and nice neighbourhood. It´s close to nice shops bars and restaurants as well as all public transport bus stop just around the corner the metro 5min away by foot. Everything with this arrangement worked out smoothly so I just have to repeat what everyone else already has written in their reviews : Jeanne is a great/ perfect host and she provided us with lots of valuable information about where to go and what to see. Many thanks again M &K
45967,682895,2011-11-01,1019421,Amanda,We spent the last week  ( 7 days) of our 2 month trip at Benoit's. It was a perfect place to relax before heading home. It has everything you need and is in a great location. Communication was easy and responsive. We'll be back again.
11583554,244139516,2018-03-18,29876770,Cat,"A beautiful modern roof top apartment in the heart of the Latin quarter and a 5 minute stroll to Notre Dame. 

Eve has a recently refurbished apartment which has all the amenities that we could have wished for in a fantastic location. 

The apartment was lovely clean spacious and everything was within a short walking distance. The property is also located on quiet road so noise is no issue at all. 

We found many amazing places to eat and drink nearby and staying at Eve’s apartment really allowed us to get a flavour of Parisienne living!  

It was a fantastic weekend and we definitely hope to be returning again in the near future. 


Thanks Eve!"

19637269,252109862,2018-04-09,98838595,Lydia,Such a lovely flat a real gem of a find in a really quirky and fun area of Paris. There are lots of local patisseries and a small supermarket just next door and a convenient metro station 3 minutes walk away. The perfect place to explore Paris from. We had good weather so got the double dooors open some food from the local market and enjoyed gazing over the Parisian roof tops. Fantastic hosts and a great little flat for a weekend away. Thank you Clarisse and Pierre. A real gem.

Unico difetto: si trova al quarto piano e senza ascensore. 
Per il resto tutto bene. Vacanza perfetta e punto di appoggio all'altezza."

1980780,158744524,2017-06-08,124862954,Margaret,I was delighted with the apartment. It's location is excellent...lots of transportation nearby plus beautiful Marais quarter.  The apartment has everything one needs plus it's quiet sunny and doesn't have tons of stairs to access.  Jean Philippe is an excellent host giving perfect instructions before my arrival meeting me on arrival and giving a helpful step through of all the apartment.  There is a charming small terrace with beautiful floors.  I recommend this apartment.
28757796,332083266,2018-10-04,31184036,Ellen,Place is located very close to everything including metro and it is a great option for budget travelers. Only issue we had was internet and floor was a bit dirty but for the price and location we spent great time in Paris. Note that this apartment does not have kitchen only microwave is available which was not a big issue for us.
1005684,311906206,2018-08-22,10532049,Tony,Convience and location can not be beat.  Real Paris
7397,55376286,2015-12-01,12205612,Michele,Great location and nice apartment! The apartment is in the heart of the Marais and close to all tourist attractions great shops and bistros.

371299,21698752,2014-10-22,1698002,Stefanie,"Very cosy well kept and thoughtful designed apartment with great use of light and decoration situated in vivid area of the city.
Is is facing the huzzling and buzzling of a trendy street but the windows isolate well and so it also feels like a calm oasis.
Thomas is reliable and very kind communication and handling of the keys was perfect. We would come back anytime."

Absolutely delightful.  The owner was absolutely wonderful and helpful (even when I forgot the keys in the flat and had to request for doubles).

I cannot recommend this flat and owner enough... she is great and the apartment was absolutely perfect for us!

Perfect location too!"

Merci pour tout.
9087939,133040240,2017-02-20,4088566,Hyojung,It is perfet for those who want to see the eiffel tower. We could see that from the 2 rooms. It is really close. Th house is very quiet and clean. Only problem(axtually not that problem) is the shower space is really smallm. The communication was perfect. Anytime we could easily cantact each other. The bed is big enough for two. It is much better than pictures. Highly recommend!

The location was amazingly convenient so that I even walked to many places on foot. The place is accessible by bus (the bus stop was right in front of the house) and the metro in less than 5 minutes walk.  Many restaurants (western or asian) shops bakeries and supermarkets nearby.  The room was warm and clean.  Definitely I'd like to come back again next time in Paris. 
"
7043650,494484269,2019-07-24,44306917,Deanna,If you are looking to visit the Montmartre area in Paris then this place may be a great fit. Pierre’s place was stylishly decorated with a tiny kitchen that had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and we loved having air conditioning during the heat wave. Communication with the host was excellent ... he went out of his way to let us store our bags on our checkout day so that we could do some more sightseeing before our departure time. Check in instructions were very clear as well.
16764298,492241612,2019-07-21,69457628,수연,"처음 들어갔을 때 화장실에 머리뭉탱이 침실에는 먼지 덩어리들이 뭉쳐다니고 가구들은 손만 대도 검은 먼지가 묻어나와서 바로 호스트에게 연락했더니 조치를 취해주었다. 호스트에게 긴급한 일이 있어서 잠시 자리를 비운 상황이라 제대로 확인이 안 된 것 같았다. 다음날 청소를 새로 해주었는데 눈에 보이는 곳들 위주로 청소해준 것 같았다. 결국 테이블은 우리가 새로 닦았다. 그래도 조치를 빠르게 잘 취해주었고 청소비는 결국 환불까지 해주었다! 화장실이 많이 좁기는 하지만 그래도 온수가 잘 나와서 괜찮았다.
그리고 숙소 위치가 너무! 너무너무 좋아서 밤 늦게 다녀도 안심이라서 좋았다. 어딜 가도 멀지 않았으며 위험하지도 않고 에펠탑 보러 멀리 가지 않아도 되는게 제일 좋았다. 덕분에 혁명기념일에 밤 늦게까지 불꽃놀이를 보고 에펠탑 구경을 할 수 있었다. 주위에 대사관들이 많아서 안전하게 느껴졌고 밤늦게까지 여는 슈퍼가 5분거리에 있어서 편리했으며 빵집도 주변에 많았다. 근데 냉장고 성능이 좀 떨어지고 성에가 많이 끼어있어서 냉동보관하는 음식을 사는건 비추천."

22092957,264165014,2018-05-13,17108043,Travis,The best thing about this place is the little street it's on. It's mostly a pedestrian street and it's filled with bakeries markets and small restaurants. When the businesses are open you walk out of this unit and you literally have all them all within a few feet. 5 minute walk to metro 13 minute walk to Eiffel tower. If you're going to spend all your time at museums you might look for something further east but this is a perfect place of you mostly want to experience living in the city. The unit itself was smaller than we expected based on the pictures with a tiny kitchen but it was comfortable.

24712344,314650993,2018-08-27,7065228,Alice,We had an absolutely brilliant stay in Sophie's stunning Parisian apartment! Communication with Sophie and Isabelle (who checked us in and was lovely) was super easy quick and friendly. They kindly provided us with lots of useful local tips and a bottle of wine which was much appreciated! The apartment is incredibly stylish and the view of the Eiffel tower is fabulous photos can't really do either justice. Everything was perfectly clean and all of the furniture (the bed sofa chairs etc.) were very comfortable. The apartment feels airy and bright and lots of thought has clearly gone in to furnishing it well. The area around the apartment is wonderful with lots of lovely bars cafes bakeries and fun shops. We would recommend the bakeries Le Grenier Pain Alexine and Pain Pain and for food/drinks Zebra for Italian food Al Coryllis and for drinks l'Ateller bar (all super close).  The apartment is super close to the metro as well. Also if you like Art Deco the Louxor cinema is walkable and amazing. For a perfect stay in Paris book Sophie's place! Thanks so much Sophie and Isabelle!!!

6810819,467190743,2019-06-10,25383683,Jason,Our trip to Paris could not have been better and our stay at Aurore's helped make it so. Aurore and family are the perfect hosts -- some of the best we have encountered on AirBnB. Very easy to communicate with. Ample directions and notes on their place. A friendly welcome as well as a message checking in midway through our stay. Their space is beautifully decorated with everything needed for a stay. The layout is perfect for a family with children with plenty of room to spread out. This was my first stay in this area of Paris and I would not hesitate to return. Easy to get around and plenty of markets and restaurants nearby. We look forward to our next trip to the city and would certainly consider Aurore's place again!

Mat and Voyelle were very kind and the photos don't really do any of the apartments little quirks justice. 

C'est bon.  "

4882717,106794082,2016-10-08,9196355,Dan,I chose this mainly for its proximity to Gare du Nord and wasn't expecting much more. The bed was comfortable the apartment was clean the bathroom was EXTREMELY tiny (a large person may not fit) but overall I got roughly what I was expecting and was quite happy with the whole situation. Jocelyn communicated everything I needed ahead of time such that I had no problem getting inside.
3393864,90687261,2016-08-01,17085516,Allison,This place was in the perfect location for sightseeing!  Maud had the place ready for us earlier than the normal check-in time since we got into Paris on an early flight.  The neighborhood was a little loud on our first night but great the rest of the nights we stayed.

1803915,260868209,2018-05-05,179960800,Jimmy,This is a great place to stay for vacation or business trips. Close to grocery and metro. And a short 15 minute walk to Bastille Le Marais etc...the hosts are so gracious accommodating and communicative.
4582583,204008147,2017-10-16,72909816,Deena,The studio is in a wonderful location. Walking distance to so many great places. The pictures are an accurate representation of the studio.
3199300,32498408,2015-05-19,1376252,Braulio,"Pierre was at the apartment waiting for us and was available and prompt to answer questions from the time I booked until we got there. 
The apartment is in a cute street with bakery a little grocery store restaurants and a train station a few blocks away. 
The apartment itself is super tiny but cute and only one flight of stairs. No real view of anything interesting from the windows but great light coming into the front windows. "
15837585,193893002,2017-09-15,67020602,Benoit,Je cherchais une location à la dernière minute et Béa a communiqué très rapidement et organisé la préparation de l'appartement dans les meilleurs délais. La descritpion reflète exactement la réalité : très bien rénové très propre et très bien placé. Un excellent séjour !
753143,61325655,2016-02-02,55508722,Mariana,Very nice place. Cozy clean and the location is very good. I was very well received and recommend this place!
30854583,469690435,2019-06-15,244835774,Daniel,Cozy studio in a great location. Very easily reachable host. The metro is right around the corner.
30969613,440001813,2019-04-20,24515129,Gesine,"Great neighborhood and small but nice apartment. 

We were however not happy to find that the sofa bed was broken and that there were no blankets provided for the 3rd person. Victor did not solve either issue during our stay and it made for a very uncomfortable sleeping situation for our daughter."
25852089,338023041,2018-10-18,4831038,Matthieu,"High standing apartment in the heart of Paris.
Very cozy and clean bedrooms and living room.
Easy check-in thanks to a code given a few hours before checking-in."
6945106,43653517,2015-08-21,15377033,Nicky,"Stephanie ensured that we were warmly welcomed by her sister because she was out of town and very thoughtfully gave us each a key. We were shown how to use all the essential electronics and the Parisian-style window closures which was absolutely great! She made sure that we had a number of essentials already there (such as soap butter bread orange juice detergents coffee) space in all the cupboards and the apartment was clean and exactly as photographed. The WiFi password and little tips and tricks were left in notes around the apartment and we received a personal welcome note on entry into the lounge.

The location is wonderfully quiet while still being in close reach to everything one could want. The supermarket is not even 100m from the building and restaurants bakeries and Metro/bus stations are close by. We ended up walking most of the time though - a lovely walk past the Opera or Les Halles that only took 40 minutes. Sacre Coeur is  visible not even 5 minutes from the apartment - it was a lovely surprise on our first day. 

We'd stay here again - and have already recommended Stephanie's place to friends."
1138091,348330065,2018-11-13,8869996,Dan,Great place great location and great family. Highly recommended.
21202728,243220218,2018-03-15,388571,Michael,"We loved the Red Room! 
The relatively large luxury bathroom is a treat in any European city perhaps especially in Paris.
The charming sturdy antique canopy bed frame might be slightly small for those of us 6 foot (approx. 1.8m) or over in height. Or if accommodating two. Or both (our case). But is otherwise a treat and will certainly give most people a unique and comfortable experience.
Such a charming safe and quiet space in a fun super convenient neighborhood. We loved it! So grateful."

5953548,73323036,2016-05-08,54357409,Tatjana,Wir verbrachten drei tolle Tage in diesem geschmackvoll eingerichteten Apartment! Alles notwendige wie z.B. Kaffeemaschine Bettwäsche Fön und Handtücher war vorhanden. Es lohnt sich auch mal die Reisetipps der beiden anzusehen sie brachten uns in eine ganz nette Ecke mit modernen individuellen Geschäften. Die Verkehrsanbindung war gut. Wir würden wieder dort Urlaub machen!
764397,90685797,2016-08-01,63281996,Jacques,"A notre arrivée un peu tôt à cause du vol intercontinent Scheryan était déjà dans l'appartement et nous a permis d'y laisser nos bagages sans problème.  Elle nous a donné tous les détails concernant l'appartement les codes d'entrée le WiFi ainsi que l'emplacement du métro épicerie etc.    L'appartement est très grand et fonctionnel très bien équipé il était idéal pour notre famille de cinq incluant trois adolescents - chacun avait son lit.  Salle de bain très propre lits confortables cafetière lave-vaisselle air climatisé grande télé lave-linge sèche-cheveux tout y est!
Le métro est à environ 7 minutes de marche et la tour Eiffel à 15 minutes.  Il y a également des pâtisseries à une dizaine de minutes et le Monoprix (épicerie) à 5 minutes à pied.
Rien à redire nous avons passé un magnifique séjour à Paris et louerons à nouveau cet appartement lors d'un prochain voyage!"

13712219,143992048,2017-04-14,18304931,Anne,"Valerie's home was awesome. A typical French home through the large doors off the street through to a court yard. My bed was so comfortable and the whole experience staying in the home was all French. Valerie made the house warm with heating and homely. I had a very delightful welcoming gift and card. I'm sorry I never met my host. Will definately come back. Close to the underground railway
And fabulous restaurants. Can get lost in Paris but the underground gets you back home.  Rue Chemin Vert was a great location. Thank you Valerie."

The neighborhood is also superb and is very close to many of the big tourist spots. Jacque was a great host and very good at communicating. It was a great experience.
3800589,108020191,2016-10-14,39649625,Florette,En séjour sur Paris j'ai décidé de tester le Airbnb. Et ça a été une très agréable expérience. Sandy et Bruno sont très gentils et accueillants ils sauront vous faire vous sentir comme à la maison. Un véritable plaisir d'autant plus que j'ai pu goûté un plat typiquement africain : délicieux ! Laissez vous tenter par le logement de Sandy et Bruno vous ne le regretterai pas !

9423674,368561416,2019-01-07,41101582,Sylvio,Julian was an excellent host very responsive and more than willing to answer any questions or provide any recommendations. The apartment is beautiful perfect for 1 or 2 people wanting a little space to themselves in the middle of Paris. I also found the building and its history to be quite charming. Overall great experience.
3528478,103760687,2016-09-24,95258596,Hab,L'appartement est très à agréable et bien équipé. Un super beau quartier qui te mets dans une superbe ambiance Parisienne.

487806,105603752,2016-10-02,25851541,Heidi,When we arrived there was dirty linens and towels in the apartment. But after sending an email to Emmanuel he arranged new via a cleaning lady who lived in the complex in under an hour while we were out at a restaurant. Very good service. The room had what we needed and was small but OK size for two people. A bit dusty on shelves and lists. Good and central location. Good opportunities for check in and out as the apartment complex is staffed 24 hours a day. Thanks for staying.

8334382,236059755,2018-02-18,78535000,Jia,"If you want to have an experience in one of those old French buildings and the neighbourhood then this is the place. 
About the host: Guy has been very patient friendly and organised. He is such an energetic and cheerful person and he is a very talented artist. I also like his music. And love his expresso! He is the best!
About the location: relatively a little remote from main attractions except Monmatre. But Paris is a city where you can get around within 30 minutes by metro so no big deal. 
About the room: I have to mention two things for others who are interested in it to take into account. Firstly the room feels cold still even the heater is fully on in February time. Secondly lack of privacy. The door cannot be locked I can see that Guy has helped make the room which is very nice and responsible of him and turn off the lights when I forgot. 
In spite of that the room is extremely quiet! Very very very quiet and sound very cozy. Small but comfortable. You can even do meditation without any problem. 
You will have free time schedule of your own here which is a plus. 
Therefore I recommend this little beautiful place to the whole community."

22883206,247338586,2018-03-28,172284500,Rodolfo,Veronique’s place is in pristine condition. Well equipped with everything you need to have a great experience in Paris. Location is outstanding if walking doesn’t bother you but also close to public transportation making it very easy to move around. Grosery stores around the corner and in an easy walk to restaurants. Even a mall a few blocks. We had great time and we would absolutely return.

The area is safe and easy to access for sightseeing and main stations ( eg.Gare du Nord Montparnasse etc... ) so we didn't need to worry when we came back late.
The room is very clean bright and cosy.
We had a nice stay in their apartment.
We definitely would like to stay here when we come back to Paris!

14294035,271026549,2018-05-31,28012053,Marion,Marc ist ein sehr freundlicher Gastgeber. Es ist seine eigene Wohnung die er vermietet und entsprechend persönlich ist es dort zu wohnen. Ja wie auch schon andere angemerkt haben Waschbecken und Spiegel im Badezimmer sind ein wenig (zu) hoch angebracht aber diese Unterkunft ist eben auch kein Hotelzimmer sondern eine kleine sehr sympathische private Wohnung unmittelbar unter Sacre Coeur. Meine Töchter und ich haben es sehr genossen noch am Abend durch die Straßen Montmartres zu laufen noch mal eben hoch zu Sacre Coeur zu steigen und zu sehen wie nach und nach die Lichter in Paris angehen ...

We also chose this situation to be close to a good metro station as well as being in an area with local services which was proven true. Thank you Raphaele!
15961345,154766211,2017-05-26,116733199,Alex,"Margherita's place was perfect for us in every way: close to the metro line St. Michel when we arrived and line 7 for our night out at the Trabebdo. Walking distance to all the museums and shops but also away from the touristic craziness. The latin district is a lot more down to earth and real than the ritzy neighborhoods nearby and it was refreshing to come home and take a break there. Margherita was a great host too prompt in every way and helpful to the end even booking us a cab on our way out. The wine she left for us was great too. Thanks Margherita!

The neighborhood is quiet easy access and plenty of restaurants and grocery stores. The apartment is very clean with a well equipped kitchen and a lovely decoration. Jacqueline is a great host very attentive and friendly which is always worried about my comfort and helped me with some problems with flights. I recommend this apartment very much. If I return to Paris I would contact Jacqueline again!
599575,7195603,2013-09-10,6970738,Laura,"We loved our Parisian experience at Beatrice apt. It is the perfect size for a couple. The location is great (close to montmarte moulin rouge) and only a quick subway ride away from Louvre notre dam Luxembourg gardens orsay etc)

The breakfast and bottle of wine welcoming us was SO wonderful and a sweet gesture. The place is very well decorated (vintage decor -- love) and super clean. 

Tips: the area has many great dining recommendations from trip advisor but they are small so def make a reservation. Take subway from airport to gare du nord and if you have lots of luggage take a cab the rest of the way. It's walkable but The trek to the apt with all the luggage can be tough! If you need to do laundry there is a laundromat right outside her window! You can buy detergent for 1 euro to use for her washing machine. Watch out for pick pickpocketers (they usually have a clip board and try to ask you for donations). "
13713682,127537413,2017-01-19,20248786,Chris,It was a cosy spot for two! It had a  well equipped kitchen.  Sophia's recommended restaurants were excellent! The studio was close to shops and the metro which had routes to the sights. Good wifi too!

Even though the location is on a bustling street the windows and curtains are high quality - once we closed things up it was very quiet and dark making it easy to sleep in. 
Great location easy access to many sights as well as the Metro stop. We had nice meals and great snacks from the many shops within two blocks of the apartment. 
The terrace was lovely! We enjoyed sitting out above the street and having a few snacks.
If you're relying on the washer/dryer maybe you'll have better luck with the dryer - we had to lay our clothes out on the terrace in order to dry them. Thankful to be able to wash during our stay at least!"
24677618,304240832,2018-08-09,5393832,Alejandro,We had such a great stay on such short notice. Hassan was a gracious host and the walk to the Eiffel Tower was only 15-20 minutes! 
1463246,366290027,2019-01-02,36389023,Franz,Nice little appartment very central and located in a quite small street.
28882470,475919344,2019-06-25,249470883,Kimberley,This was our first time using Airbnb and we were pleased with how easy it was to find a great place with a great host. Sylvie’s apartment was exactly as pictured and was perfect for our family of three. We loved the neighborhood- just right around the corner we found our new favorite fruit sellers (La Bonne Pomme) cafes and a delicious bakery. And the Marais is a perfect home base for exploring Paris. We can’t wait to return!
441972,3563509,2013-02-17,4642970,Selma,"Pour une première expérience AirBnB je suis un peu partagée.
Bastien est un hôte disponible qui a pu dans un très bref délais répondre à chacune de mes questions-(n'étant pas familière avec ce système)-malgré le fait que je ne l'ai jamais rencontré en personne. Mais j'ai pu faire la connaissance de ces deux colocataires Perrine et Céline. 
La chambre est fidèle aux indications données sur le site et le fait d'avoir accès à la cuisine était accommodant. 
Et bien sur ce logement est très bien situé.
La seule chose qui m'ait déçu -considérant le prix de la chambre-était la salle de bain: le rideau de douche était dans un piteux état (vieux jaunit et taché) et les deux tapis dont la couleur claire n'était qu'un vague souvenir se voyaient recouverts de cheveux fibres d'habits et autres poussières environnantes. Je conçoit qu'il s'agisse d'un appartement de ""jeunes"" mais il me semble que malgré un budget ""serré"" le renouvellement de quelques accessoires de base soit envisageable pour un coût raisonnable. 
Pour finir sur une note positive je tiens à souligner l'attention de l'hôte qui a mis à disposition plusieurs plans de la ville ainsi qu'un petit guide pratique.

3718164,520236130,2019-08-30,156130756,Liz,What a wonderful location and flat!!! This space is beautiful and you will want to spend every evening on the balcony enjoying the view.

1098905,16652403,2014-07-31,13600729,Cynthia,"AWESOME! It made all of us felt at home. The house is well equipped with necessary appliances and amenities. It made the stay really comfortable. the down side of the stay is only that it will be a little dangerous if you are travelling in a group of girls heading back home late night as the neighbourhood is rather quiet. 
After all we really love and enjoy our stay! Will definitely recommend to our friends! "

It's near Montsouris Park close to shops and 10 minutes walk to the metro stations. We would definitely recommend. Frederick who welcomed us for the check in and out was very friendly and helpful.

11164518,250853271,2018-04-06,159653501,Átylla,O pequeno apartamento tem capacidade para acomodar bem 6 pessoas. As camas são boas tudo funciona bem a cozinha é equipada com o necessário e encontra se muito limpo e conservado. O sistema de aquecimento é muito bom. O apartamento fica em um bairro  tranquilo próximo a frutarias  padarias restaurantes supermercados e a estacao de metrô. Para os principais pontos turísticos é necessario trocar de linha de metrô mas não se gasta mais de 30 minutos para qualquer uma delas. Fica bem distante do aeroporto então cuidado com o tamanho das malas se você for  de transporte público. Voltaria novamente sem duvidas. Me senti em casa.
33790658,473292535,2019-06-21,80356635,Nick,This apartment is perfectly located across the street from charming cafes and within a 10 minutes walk of Luxembourg Gardens and the Seine. Very clean and well furnished unit inside a classic Parisian building. Only warning is that it requires climbing five flights of stairs and has some low ceilings. Anyone over 6 feet might struggle in the bathroom and shower.
3470187,123250533,2016-12-28,62181360,Lori,We had an amazing and comfortable 10 days in the apartment.  When we arrived they were there to greet us explain the apartment and showed us what we needed to make us comfortable.  They made us feel like we were at home immediately.  During the stay Denis was in touch a few times to make sure that we had everything we needed.  Everything was clean comfortable and organized.  The neighborhood had everything you could want.  A grocery store a few bakeries lots of restaurants and cafes and was close to two different metro stops.  I would highly recommend this apartment.

Bus- und Métrostationen liegen ganz in der Nähe und man hat keine Probleme innerhalb kürzester Zeit überall hinzukommen. Die Wohnung selbst ist ein Altbau modern eingerichtet und mit allem was man brauchen könnte ausgestattet. Emmanuel hat uns all unsere Frage beantwortet und sich via Email rührend um uns gekümmert.

The room is really nice. It gives you that ""vintage"" feel that some like myself look forward to. Also it is close to many important attractions and a main metro station."

Die Unterkunft ist perfekt gelegen ein Supermarkt ist gleich um die Ecke und bis zur nächsten Metro Station sind es nur wenige hundert Meter. Trotz der zentralen Lage ist es angenehm ruihg und beschaulich.

429331,7808911,2013-10-04,6652581,Beth,My husband and I have been renting vacation apartments in France for several years and this was by far our best experience. The apartment is huge and very nicely appointed Pierrette gave us a big folder full of recommendations for shopping and eating the availability of cookware and other amenities (e.g. salt coffee soap paper goods) far exceeded the norm and the convenience of Metro and bus service was excellent. Very comfortable bed lovely sunny space easy to come home and relax a very secure building clear instructions on how to get there -- this rental could not have been better.

3673349,259034260,2018-04-30,2652059,Ondrej,The apartment is bigger than other options in Paris so it gives you more comfort. You do not have to worry about the accuracy you will find the apartment as you can see it in the pictures. We did not meet Anne in person but the communication and the check in and out process were without any issues. I can easily recommend Anne´s apartment to other travelers.

3146596,32456876,2015-05-18,25206255,Belinda,A bright clean apartment with a great view from 6th floor. Communication with Sabine was good she always responded quickly. The lady who let me in was very nice and via the (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate app we spoke easily. Located just down the street from the metro and around the corner from everything you would need - supermarket restaurants. I recommend going to Juhles vin cave & fromagerie. Helpful staff beautiful products.

La Bastille is a very lively area and we found the locals friendly and helpful. Good transport communications so a great place to start exploring Paris from.

863566,5831105,2013-07-18,7095720,Nathan,The flat was certainly small but hey how much time do you really want to spend in your room while visiting Paris? While it was small is was very clean newly remodeled and VERY well maintained! The hosts have set up a great system so it's easy to get in and out when you need to. Overall it was great. We will visit again when we return to Paris!

The host Jean-François was extremely friendly helpful and easygoing. Our experience was very enjoyable and I can recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to stay in Paris without reservation.
28330663,522518453,2019-09-02,21654340,Martin,Solid value for an entire studio in a great neighborhood in Paris. The farmers market right outside was great. We had issues with key box checking in/out but maybe it's a one time technical issue. Bathroom could be cleaner but overall we'd stay here again if given the choice.
34439577,496987654,2019-07-28,18366396,Mehtap,Un wd réussi chez Perrine et son conjoint un charmant couple qui s’est montré arrangeant et réactif de la prise de contact au rendu des clefs. L’appartement est très bien situé à proximité des transports et des commerces. Par ailleurs les infos ont été claires et exhaustives en somme tout le nécessaire pour que le séjour se prépare et se passe au mieux. Je recommande.

It was definitely more than we expected and made the trip even more pleasant. The apartment is super close to the metro very easy to get around and located in a very safe neighbourhood. I'm sure I'll be booking again with Amelie in the near future. Thank you for always being contacable and helpful in answering all our questions.
21537857,229369106,2018-01-23,23303719,Luis,This is in my regard a very good apartment. It is extremely well located since you can be in the center in less than 25 minutes. The area where it is located is very good subway is just one minute walk away there are plenty of traditional bistro restaurant's just facing the subway entrance plus a deli and bakery a butcher selling roast chicken next door and a fabulous monoprix supermarket next door where you can buy everything you need. Hard to get a better place to stay. The apartment is located on the 2nd floor with elevator. It is very clean and contemporary furnished a nice size living area a small but very well thought kitchen an extremely good size bathroom and a tiny bedroom with a double bed. It is a very quiet apartment especially the bedroom. Everything works fine and the host was there on time to welcome us. We had a very good stay and will definitely come back. We loved the location an extremely good neighborhood and very safe. The subway system in Paris works extremely well and it was a pleasure to come to such a good apartment at the end of the day.
2264796,55034254,2015-11-27,48736506,Sandra,I think the studio was well represented by the photos. The neighborhood was great~ easy to walk to restaurants and the metro was so close!

Avec cette location Fosca nous prouve que sans devenir hôtelier l'improvisation n'a aucune place dans le service du logement.
Car c'est principalement le logement qui fait votre séjour puisque vous avez la maîtrise de tout le reste.

L'appartement est idéalement situé d'une propreté impeccable on se sent reçu la remise des clés est efficace par la biais d'Anita qui forme avec Fosca un duo redoutable qui fera de votre séjour un moment où vous n'aurez à vous soucier de rien concernant votre logement.

En bref je recommande vivement. Parfait !"
13200815,129066327,2017-01-29,38034801,Susan,What a super location RER and metro just around the corner supermarket restaurants and bakery just downstairs. Not to mention how good it is inside the apartment. Clean bathroom comfortable bed and well equipped kitchen. Highly recommend this place and definitely will come back again.
21455822,456361833,2019-05-21,26968732,Bettina,Overall a stylish and modern apartment suited for 2 travelling with a Metro station seconds away from the apartment. Please note that there is Limited amenities in the apartment such as no kettle hairdryer or microwave so we couldn’t make tea or warm up our meals. Also  the Dishwasher and bin was full when we arrived. It was hard to get hold of Gaylord to answer our questions prior to checking in as he was travelling. Be aware the lock on door was super difficult to open with limited instructions. Have to use a lot of strength to open the sticky lock.  Overall nice place to stay but could be greatly improved with a few more amenities.

3015135,282322949,2018-06-27,43201062,Céline,L'appartement d'Adriano correspondait à nos attentes (lit et douche différents des photos). La literie est vraiment super. Très bien situé dans Paris avec métro à 3min à pieds restaurants et pubs dans la rue (mais aucun bruit la nuit). Se trouve au rez-de-chaussé et donne sur une petite cours arborée. Ventilo mis à disposition. 
5250277,76573498,2016-05-28,7322734,Andrew,We cannot praise Michel's flat highly enough. It is a cliche to say but true that the photos don't do it justice. He has made great use of a relatively small space and it has a wonderful atmosphere that adds to the already slightly surreal experience of being in such an old building in the heart of the left bank. It is also very easy to find and particulalry accessible from the Eurostar being just a couple of stops from Gare du Nore o the RER.  Michel is very communicative and ensured we had excellent clear genuinely useful information to assist our stay well in advance. Michel was not able to greet us himself his friend Linda was warm and welcoming in his stead. We would highly recommend choosing  to stay with
7453242,286395485,2018-07-06,11333059,Veronika,A lovely and charming place to stay for a few days in Paris. Easily accessible on the second floor of an old house in the Marais. Since I travelled alone I found it also very comfortable for just one person. It is close to wonderful Cafe's and shops and very close to the beautiful Place des Vosges. It is quieter at night than many places in Paris. Jerome left everything in top shape and very accommodating details of what to do and see. A feeling of care and kindness for his guests was very noticeable. I would certainly stay in Jerome's apartment again. 
27716333,366290934,2019-01-02,132447535,Marcelina,The stay was lovely and the location is fantastic.

10395558,199550416,2017-10-02,40901,Donna,This is one of those rare airbnb finds a true highly atmospheric Parisian home filled with beautiful design pieces and great art and objects. It's also well equipped for cooking and just hanging out and there's a bath (always a bonus if you're doing lots of flaneuring). It's close to good very happening nightlife strips and a short stroll to both the canal and the Marais as well as the new restaurants popping up in Belleville. Mieke is a wonderful host that thinks of everything you'll need before you're there and there's a very lovely assistant on hand if she's away and you need anything.
7844501,52621989,2015-10-31,17351491,Seohee,I stayed here for 1 week. It's comfortable and convenient in a perfect location. very easy of access to any museums restaurants supermarket and metro. nighborhood is also nice so I could sleep well at night. the studio is spacious enough for two people. especially bathroom is not small that's why I choose.  Hugo is so gentle and flexible. I would surely recommend. 
1694110,76768909,2016-05-29,69304354,Beatrice,Excellent location in a family friendly area very safe with plenty of excellent bars/restaurants/ shops directly around you. The apartment itself is very cosy and comfortable with all the useful utilities and beautiful views of the Sorbonne and surrounding neighbourhood. Spectacular at night! Also not far at all from a train station and many stops which was very helpful for navigating around Paris. Lovely park nearby great for picnics. Sarah was extremely friendly and welcoming and made us feel very at home. We greatly enjoyed our time here!

또 숙소도 안전한 동네에 있어서 좋았어요! 그리고 퐁피두센터와 마레지구가 걸어서 5-10분 거리에 있어서 돌아다니기 좋습니다."

There is a fully equipped kitchen two double beds and one extra bed (retractable). It was clean. Alain is an excellent host – he provided lots of information about Paris good places around such as breakfast spots restaurants shops pharmacy transport… His advice and attitude were absolutely invaluable!
I recommend the apartment.

The area abounds in specialty shops particularly near the Abbesses metro station. In contrast there is a vibrant and very affordable food market in Simplon on Sundays (an easy walk). Highly recommended.

Philippine var jättetrevlig mycket uppmärksam och tillgänglig för att svara på våra frågor och hjälpa oss att med allt.
Jag skulle gärna ha stannat längre.
Något som kan vara störande för vissa och det var för oss är att det inte fanns gardiner för fönstren. Solen lyste in väldigt tidigt på morgonen i alla rum men förutom det allt perfekt. Vi älskade lägenheten."

19886965,181795909,2017-08-13,2853748,Sophia,"Rue Mouffetard - what a lovely street. Lots of shops and little cute restaurants - even an organic supermarket and a Crêperie with gluten-free Crêpes for people with allergies (like me) closeby! Everything is in reach within a couple of minutes and the neighborhood is clean and lively! A great spot for everyone who loves Quartier Latin (- just less overcrowded)!
The appartment was tidy clean and Hugo provided with everything I needed - he even left some Salt Oil and Pepper for me to cook in the appartment. The bed is super comfy - I slept very well. The only thing you have to keep in mind when booking is to bring some earplugs since you can very well hear the neighbors. If you have a light sleep that might be an issue. 
Overall it was a great stay Hugo is an excellent host very helpful and there for you if you have questions of any kind. I will come back for sure!"

Just minutes from Place de la République her quiet apartment is centrally located near the Canal St. Martin Gare du Nord and the Marais. Just 2 blocks from Du pain et des ideas- the best bakery in Paris. The studio is small but a delight to the senses with innovative design and tasteful touches. We felt secure and comfortable our entire stay.

19796590,235050183,2018-02-15,115437198,Sumeet,I would like to start with reviewing 亚萍's review. That you may find somewhere below mine. No the host was punctual all the time breakfast leaving for work coming back from work. She took only 3 minutes to take a shower as the bathroom was shared. We got a tour of the house so no problem there. Yes the bathroom locks were jammed and there are no locks in the bedroom either. But in her defense this is a house she rents she doesn't own it. The bad condition of the locks is not entirely her problem. But we didn't face a single incidence of anyone invading our privacies. Yes there is a teenage boy in the house who gets up early in the morning takes a shower and leaves the house at 8 AM without making slightest noise. When he is back from school he is always in his room. There was no mention of any money ever I wasn't charged anything extra. Yes the Effiel Tower picture in her photograph is very misleading it is taken from the nearby bridge not her living room. When you see the photo on the Airbnb website it doesn't show you the caption of the photo which at least according to Natacha says that it is from a nearby bridge. The title of her place says Effiel Tower view which is accurate expect the Effiel Tower is somewhat hidden by the buildings. Not a photo-worthy view. Lastly Largo is the most adorable dog you'll ever come across. The 亚萍's review is a lie. I didn't hear a single bark from him during my entire stay and I stayed for 5 days. Even if you are not fond of dogs Largo is practically like a stuffed toy totally harmless. Now our review: Natacha is the warmest host that we have ever met. If this is your first time in Paris we recommend staying at her Parisian home. Her locality is very safe and very accessible even on late nights. She has immense knowledge about Paris and all the tourist locations how to get there easily which time to go and she is always ready to share her knowledge. Every morning she used to help us in planning the Itinerary for the day. She used to tell us the closest metro station for every place that we wanted to visit. Even if she was late for her work she patiently answered every query we had. During our stay Natacha was having a very difficult phase in her personal life which I choose not to mention in the Airbnb review. I can imagine the stress she was going through. But that never reflected in the way she carried herself. She is a very professional lady. If you consider this alone you can easily ignore the issues with her place. At the end of the day the choice is yours do you want to choose a Hotel room with no disturbance or interaction or an Airbnb...
28486278,553064250,2019-10-23,45130024,Annie,Great location in the heart of “quartier latin”. The metro station entrance is on the square in front of the building. Very clean and quiet room. Liliane and Jean-Marie are available and welcoming. You have plenty of very reasonably priced restaurant in the street and take aways. The appartement is nicely renovated and decorated. Finally the lift is a real plus when on the 5th floor!

4894506,71461632,2016-04-25,6188171,Jon,My best Airbnb experience to date.  Lucas met my friend & I at his flat and gave us excellent guidance on the house and surrounding neighborhood; we felt like locals after only a few days :).  The flat is located a short walk from the Glaciere Metropolitian stop making for easy travels anyway in Paris.  I highly recommend L'Hydrophobe (per Lucas suggestion) for a fantastic French meal.  I can't wait to return to Paris again.

32326824,498736939,2019-07-30,60227455,Kristen,"Our family of 4 spent July 2019 at Sweet 16th and had a wonderful stay.  The apartment was just as pictured except that my favorite part -- a beautiful courtyard with trees surrounding a grassy square does not appear in the pictures.  The courtyard is the view from one of the bedrooms.  The apartment gets beautiful sunlight and has a large tree out the dining room / living room windows.  It also has great window shutters that can partially or completely block all light from outside when closed.  The shutters roll up and down mechanically -- no pinched fingers with unfolding metal shutters.

The kitchen was well-equipped with plenty of dishes/cutlery as well as a variety of pots and pans.  The washing machine in the kitchen works well (settings vary from a little over an hour to 4 hours so it's worth exploring them all) and the drying rack had plenty of room to unfold in the kitchen right in front of a large window to help with fast drying.  

The apartment does not have AC but we were there for a brief 3-day heat wave when temperatures reached 100+ and the apartment remained very comfortable.  We could block the light during the day with the shutters and each room has a fan in good working condition.  The apartment is also a short walk to the Ranelagh park and the Bois de Boulogne which offer good shade in the summer.

The neighborhood is safe and offers everything we needed within a few blocks.  There were multiple grocery stores great patisseries and restaurants a dry cleaner a cheese shop a meat shop a fruit shop a pasta store and a chocolate shop -- most on Avenue Mozart right by the Ranelagh metro.  It was an easy walk to Ave. President Kennedy where the 72 bus picks up as well as to Radio France where the 70 picks up.  From CDG airport the RER A to the RER B will get you within a couple blocks of the apartment.  For our return we arranged for a taxi through Ruben to bring us back to the airport (because the RER B was closed for renovations) and the taxi was definitely the easiest way to get to the airport with our family.  It was also a good price and would be a good option for both arrival and departure."

I had very heavy luggage and would have had trouble getting it up the stairs. However the hosts helped me carry everything up and were very kind. If you want to stay right close to Moulin Rouge and a quick walk to Sacre Court and are just looking for a place to sleep and shower and cook a quick breakfast this is the perfect spot for you.

33268075,452529729,2019-05-13,249767181,Carley,I absolutely loved this apartment and would definitely book this Airbnb again. Julien was an amazing host and provided everything needed in the apartment to make you feel at home. He was genuinely welcoming when we arrived to the apartment which instantly made us feel comfortable. He made sure we had everything we needed and was very accessible during our stay. The apartment is in a very safe area with good security to get inside the building which allowed us to feel safe and relaxed the whole time. This apartment was also very spacious and could comfortably fit 4 people with the pull out couch. Everything was very clean when we arrived to the apartment and we instantly felt very much at home. I would highly recommend this Airbnb not only for the amazing apartment but also for the excellent hospitality we received from Julien.
8269878,275054256,2018-06-10,30810072,Christina,The location is excellent Julien provided fantastic recommendations  easy access to public transport definitely tiny but worth it for the area! The bed is very very comfortable!! Merci beaucoup Julien!

O predio é antigo e a entrada e acesso não são dos mais animadores não espere nada bonito mas o apartamento é diferente disso com uma decoraçao limpa e agradavel.
Uma boa opçao para ficar em Paris."
9069114,228306175,2018-01-19,16609353,Foppe,This is one of the best places to stay in Paris. The room is beatiful and has a good bed you have your own bathroom and Marie Helene is a very gracious host. She even made me breakfast! I will be staying here again when I am in Paris later this year. Thanks Marie Helene!
27834396,553390600,2019-10-24,280414417,Nena,"The communication a bit because the host always sleep  the very bad is he sleep on the share space near living room and bathroom this space so small and he has one bad on there  many day he took his girlfriend come to stay and sleep and he expand his bed to double bed very terrible because the room is so small 
The bed room no lock this is terrible 
When he sleep he close the window the blinds the room is so dark when I’m want to go the bathroom so hard 
I’m not impressed this room so dirty the dust also everywhere in the room
The room is so dirty have dust everywhere under the bed on the furniture so bad
Very bad experience"
1828949,192374640,2017-09-10,5597235,Eva,Great location with easy access to eating places grocery stores metro and a beautiful position on the Seine.  Notre Dame sitting spectacularly on your back doorstep and many other sights within easy reach. Quiet in the evenings even on the weekend. The apartment had everything you think you could need and more. Elena was there to meet greet and explain all we needed to know.  A very comfortable and memorable stay.

1119185,240985611,2018-03-07,135328184,Rahel,Jalie ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Wohnung ist ausreichend - Ausstattung Sauberkeit und Wärmedämmung eher mäßig ... in Ordnung wenn man einen Schlafplatz sucht und den Tag in der Stadt verbringt.
5475961,29799992,2015-04-12,9012041,Achim,"Alles hat super geklappt. Ahmed ist ein hervorragender Gastgeber. Super flexibel und zuvorkommend. Er hat uns sogar den Schlüssel zur Wohnung während seiner Arbeitszeit überreicht weil bei uns alles recht kurzfristig war. Super!
Zur Wohnung: Alles ist sauber und ordentlich und der Ausblick aus dem Fenster im 27. Stock mitten in Paris ist fantastisch! Man wohnt über einem Einkaufszentrum (alles da was man braucht) und direkt neben der Metrostation. Perfekt um die Stadt zu erkunden. Sehr toll ist auch dass zu Wohnung ein kostenfreier bewachter Tiefgaragenparkplatz gehört: Eine Rarität in Paris die Gold wert ist.
Man teilt sich mit Ahmed Küche und Bad (er hält sich aber sehr bedeckt in seinem Zimmer und steht sogar extra früher auf um ein kleines Frühstück zu machen!).
Das Zimmer allerdings ist sehr klein (zwei kleine Hocker ein kleines Regal und ein gemütliches Doppelbett) sodass man sich in der Wohnung doch nur zum Schlafen und Duschen etc. aufhält. Man könnte sich selbst was in der gut ausgestatteten Küche kochen aber auch da gibt es nur eine kleine Theke an der man dann essen könnte.
Für uns war das gar kein Problem da wir von Morgens bis Abends durch die Stadt gestreift sind. Man fährt ja nicht nach Paris um in irgendeiner Bude zu hocken! 

Fazit: Kleines gutes Zimmer in perfekter Lage mit sehr hilfsbereitem und freundlichem Gastgeber! (und PARKPLATZ!)"

5268125,46693406,2015-09-13,29474676,Meggan,The apartment was just as described.  It was small but manageable for our 4 night stay. We felt it was in a great location and loved the market right around the corner. The market is perfect for grabbing some goods to go to sit with at the Eiffel Tower. The shower is very small but again we managed.

4171009,41393701,2015-08-07,36104175,Karyn,Caroline's apartment is great. Beautifully preysented. Perfect location and just the right size. I was traveling with my friend and offered to take the fold out bed in the living room. I'm so glad I did. The bed was so comfortable and going to sleep with the sounds of Paris in the background was a treat. I can't fault this apartment and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks Caroline.
17931651,266597804,2018-05-20,87513281,Ryan,Ghislaine’s flat was just perfect. It was everything I needed for a weekend in Paris. Close to the line 10 metro. The apartment was very clean in a very quiet area and had just the right touches to make one feel right at home. When I come back to Paris I plan on checking the availability of this apartment first!

35855780,503527123,2019-08-06,163417106,Shikha,"Tommy’s is not very far from the centre (30mins from eiffel tower) which was ok according to the price we paid. It was 2mins from the nearest metro station. That was so convenient. The supermarket Lidl was also a min walk from home. 
Tommy has been so quick in his responses so that really helped.
His place was in general very clean and spacious for max 4people. The only thing that can improve was the second bed which was not so comfortable. Rest everything was nice. I totally recommend this place. :) thanks."
25903356,328410114,2018-09-26,45173780,Lisa,This apt. was everything we could have asked for.  Located in the heart of the Latin Quarter with easy access to restaurants shops and grocery. About a two minute walk to the metro.  The apt was well stocked with towels dishes and cutlery. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Paris. A+
6697204,41683603,2015-08-08,32426425,Eunkyeong,I stayed 5 days in this apartment with my mom and we really satisfied it. The apartment was pretty clean morden and quiet. Carrefour is near the apartment. (It take 3 minutes by foot) The kitchen bathroom are clean and well-equipped and the bed is big and comfortable . JB and her daughter were really kind and friendly. They alaways cared if we had feel uncomfortable or inconvience. (And Absoutle not.) Actually we had problem of missing our luaage from flight and they helped us everything on behalf of us. We really appreciate their kind help and I'll never forget their help. If I'll go Paris again I want to stay this apartment.
9398765,93062174,2016-08-11,85713296,Saskia,Mariangela was very helpful with giving information concerning the location of her apartment and providing information in general. I would recommend Mariangela's place because it's close to the metro station Nation and because it's a relatively spacious and clean apartment.
6141147,293359215,2018-07-20,60616538,Jessica,This was a lovely apartment to stay in. It was perfect for us as it was only a short walk away from the centre of MontMarte but in a quiet location. The apartment has definitely got a “lived in” feel to it and there are a few do’s and dont’s When staying there - which is to be expected when you’re staying in someone’s home. The apartment was ideal for us but it might be worth noting that if you have mobility issues it may be difficult to get in and out of the bath for showers.
487228,54107894,2015-11-16,2002748,Ester,"THE BEST:
Elise is a very nice Host. She is always willing to help.
THE WROST:
The shower is in the guest room and the toilet is in the living room (Where the host sleeps). 
This means that every time the host wants to use the shower she need to go into your room and every time you need to go to toilet (In the night or early morning) you have to pass near the bed of the host. If you don't want to wake up her you can't use the kitchen because it's near her too. 
the shower handle is broken so you have to hold the shower in your hand or put it down on the floor.
LO MEJOR:
Elise es una anfitriona encantadora. Ella siempre está dispuesta a ayudar.
LO PEOR:
La ducha está en la habitación del invitado y el wc está en el salón (Don de duerme el anfitrión)
Esto significa que cada vez que el anfitrión necesita usar la ducha ella necesita entrar en tu habitación y cada vez que tu tienes que usar el Wc (Sobre todo por la noche o pronto por la mañana) tu tienes que pasar al lado de la cama del anfitrión. Si no quieres despertarla no puedes usar la cocina porque está al lado de su cama también.
El soporte de la ducha está roto de manera que tienes que aguantar la ducha con la mano o dejarla en el suelo.

38808227,541537161,2019-10-05,151069288,Mary,I absolutely reccomend everyone to visit Iness and stay with her. She is super host attentive hospitable and very helpfull.  Her little clean flat is almost 10 minutes walking distance from Arc De Triomphe 3 minutes distance from subway which makes place easily reachable and convenient to visit main attractions of Paris (Website hidden by Airbnb) Whats most important Iness is very helpfull she even ordered taxi at 5 am for me as i was about to miss my plain and was in hurry as i reached the bus station find out that she paid for taxi herself. It was shocking surprise for me never ever had the same situation. She is always ready to help find best solution for her guests. I’m so greatfull. She is best ❤️

The apartment was a spacious and gracious home away from home; perfectly equipped kitchen modern bathrooms comfortable beds. We left wishing we had arranged a longer stay! Highly recommend.
36617485,503725407,2019-08-06,838325,Maya,a fantastic place—amelia her husband and their contact (jeremy) were all super warm and welcoming and totally responsive to all my needs. the location could not be more central—literally around the corner from pompidou and 2 minutes to chatelet/halles (getting to/from the airports via RER is SUPER EASY AND FAST). you probably will never need to take the metro as everything is on your doorstep (from great cafes/restos to grocery stores and all the best of the rive droite et gauche). amazingly even though it’s literally in the center of everything the place is unbelievably QUIET—the appart has huge windows (that make it sunny and cheery) that look out onto a huge beautiful tree and courtyard (and not the street)—so total privacy and tranquility. you may hear a tiny bit of street noise from weekend revelers but earplugs will solve that if you’re a very sensitive sleeper. totally equipped with a full kitchen and bath washing machine tons of closets and mirrors etc. bed is a fold out but is big and SUPER COMFORTABLE perhaps the best airbnb bed i’ve slept on!!  an amazing deal that i wholeheartedly recommend— i will definitely try to stay here again on my next visit to paris!!

Eitan est d'une parfaite gentillesse et très fiable. Seul tout petit bémol: un petit peu bruyant car situé à un carrefour et les fenêtres n'ont pas de double vitrage. On s'habitue vite car le quartier est assez calme. Cela ne m'empêchera pas de revenir et de conseiller ce studio!"

Der Canal St Martin / Republique / Rue Oberkampf / Supermarkt / Bäckereien / Markt … alles ist in etwa nach 5 min zu erreichen. Das Haus ist super-safe. Absolut empfehlenswert!

Negativ: Die Badetuch-Halterung war defekt Lampe in der Dusche war kaputt (man musste im Dunkeln duschen) und einige Stellen waren nicht wirklich sauber."
33438978,447198327,2019-05-03,77611045,Alyssa,Very small but nice flat! We stayed for three nights and got around Paris totally fine. There is a metro stop close by that takes you to all the touristy locations only about a 20 minute ride. The space was small but for one or two people it’s perfect. We had to buy our own paper towels and toilet paper which was not expected. No WiFi was a little rough but there are plenty of spots nearby that you can use theirs. Overall great location and great apartment! I’d stay again.
14904802,427792283,2019-03-24,61118436,Marco,Ho soggiornato per 4 settimane nell'appartamento gestito da Myriam convenientemente localizzato a 1 minuto a piedi dalla stupenda Place des Vosges e a 5 minuti a piedi da piazza della Bastiglia. Lo spazioso monolocale è arredato con gusto e con personalità ed è dotato di tutto il necessario anche per un soggiorno prolungato compresi i prodotti per la casa sciampo e bagnoschiuma e quelli di base per la cucina (sale olio zucchero etc.). Non mancano ovviamente piatti bicchieri pentolame etc.. Ho dormito molto bene perché il letto e' comodo le tende molto oscuranti e la strada tranquilla. Il bagno è finestrato e dotato di una piccola lavatrice. Il WiFi funziona bene.  L'appartamento è secondo me perfetto per soggiorni lunghi anche perché la tariffa mensile è assai più conveniente di quella giornaliera. La comunicazione con Myriam è stata impeccabile e ogni piccolo inconveniente è stato risolto a tempo di record. Unico aspetto negativo la pulizia non impeccabile: a causa del traffico l'aria di Parigi è polverosa e quindi sarebbe necessaria una pulizia a fondo più frequente. In ogni caso l'appartamento di Myriam ha superato le mie aspettative e ci ritornerei molto volentieri se dovessi soggiornare ancora a Parigi.

В квартире есть все необходимое для готовки причем сковородки новые с тефлоновым покрытием. Рядом 2 супермаркета. И рынок с морепродуктами по выходным. На нем мы покупали свежих устриц на ужин. Рядом метро 160 м. чуть подальше другая ветка. Квартира очень светлая и чистая. Перед бронированием изучили много вариантов и рада что выбрали именно этот. Изабелль пошла нам на встречу и разрешила ранний заезд и поздний выезд. Отличный вай фай. Обязательно будем рекомендовать жилье друзьям.

372879,295383738,2018-07-23,176364977,Julie,"Samuel’s apartment was clean and comfortable for our family of 4 when we visited Paris. My teenage son slept on the sofa bed and my daughter slept on the twin bed in the bedroom.  We usually have to get two hotel rooms for our family and this was a very cost-effective arrangement for us. 

It was well-located with access to all types of public transportation and was an easy walk to Luxembourg Garden.  There are restaurants and a great boulangerie nearby.

Samuel was a great host who communicated well and gave quick responses to any inquiries we had.  The apartment was very clean and everything was set up and ready for our arrival.

When I told Samuel our train would be arriving prior to check-in time he gave me information for a nearby restaurant where we could get drinks to pass the time if we wished. 

The reason this apartment gets a a 4-Star rating instead of 5 is primarily because of the noise we encountered while we were there.  We had hoped for a more peaceful place.  Unfortunately while we were there we had to have the windows open because of the summer heat which enabled us to hear every city sound — neighbor conversations children crying trash cans being rolled down the street cars and nearby construction.  

The noise did subside by 10:30-11:30 pm most nights however  a neighbor had a loud party that lasted until 1:30 am one night. I can’t fault Samuel for this as he has no control over his neighbors.  I only say this because if you’re like me and do not live in a city with close proximity to neighbors you will probably be affected by all the sounds. This apartment is tucked away so it could have been worse. But if you are sensitive to noise then you should be looking for a place in the country or a hotel with air conditioning and closed windows.  Or rent this place in the cooler months when the windows are closed.

1957096,321816593,2018-09-11,8522727,Erika,The price and location were EXCELLENT.  Metro station steps away a very handy organic market directly across the street overlooking the Louvre! Walking distance to excellent restaurants. The apartment is very small but we were able to fit 5 adults without too much trouble. (Although I think this place would work best for 4 people max.) Kitchen and bathroom nicely updated. The area felt really safe even at night. Eric greeted us when we got there and was very accommodating and helpful.

Lo que no nos ha gustado mucho es el barrio en sí en las calles adyacentes siempre había un ambiente raro y parecía no muy seguro aún así nunca nos pasó nada.
Guillaume estuvo muy atento y agradable siempre."

7747553,352501615,2018-11-25,3359058,Erin,"This is a gem of an apartment tucked away in a cute neighborhood on a quiet cobblestoned alley but completely within walking or metro distance from everything you might like to see. The most surprising aspect of the apartment is how quiet and cozy it is even though you are right in the middle of Paris...amazing! At night you cannot hear anything at all...really! The apartment is absolutely spotless and tastefully decorated. There are all cooking amenities and a small fridge...also a cute sitting area for watching French TV when you need some rest after a long day of walking around. The apartment also has excellent heating which was important due to the cold weather outside. There are abundant shops nearby for groceries including an array of boulangeries and specialty markets. Various metro lines are between a 5 and 10-minute walk from the apartment: very convenient but nice to be slightly off the beaten path in terms of tourists and noise. There are many cute restaurants of all kinds nearby from French to pizza to Korean and Japanese. We would definitely come back and stay here! Note: It's true what others and Evelyne say about the sleeping space: it is ""trés charmante"" and requires some ducking and crawling :-) But you can see the Eiffel Tower from the roof window and we just cracked ourselves up every night getting into bed. Once you're there it's no problem. Also for those who may not be extremely mobile it is a 3rd story walk-up and the bedroom is also at the end of a spiral staircase. Again we liked these aspects but some people may not. Finally Evelyne was very kind on the night that we arrived and throughout our visit. She was there to greet us and show us how everything worked as well as offer suggestions about where to eat and shop for the best cheeses and pastry. All-in-all a fantastic experience. Thank you Evelyne for offering your home!"
15267786,268200444,2018-05-24,59620648,Christina,The apartment was in a great location and the hosting service was excellent when we had travel delays. Thank you!

There's many restaurants and pharmacies nearby and you can get some booze right in front of the house.
Betty was very kind and she waited for me to explain about the room when I got there.

I regularly visit Paris and will definitely choose this one again!"

Die Wohnung ist geschmackvoll eingerichtet und man hat eine atemberaubende Aussicht auf Paris sowie den Eifelturm. Sonnenlicht durchflutet schon am Morgen die Wohnung. Man kann sich nur wohl fühlen! 
Auch die Lage ist wunderbar. Einkaufmöglichkeiten sind direkt um die Ecke und die öffentliche Verkehrmittel direkt vor der Haustür. 
Adel ist ein unglaublich freundlicher und überaus hilfsbereiter Gastgeber und steht bei Fragen jederzeit zur Verfügung.

La zona no es turística se puede ver y vivir otro París fuera del circuito turístico. Es importante saber esto para no llevarse ""sorpresas"". Queda muy cerca de Montmartre (se puede ir caminando) y a unas cuadras de la estación de metro de la línea 4. Es un barrio que se accede fácilmente y no tuvimos ningún problema.
Zoé no tuvo problema con nuestro horario de llegada y de salida de la casa cosa que nos facilitó mucho por nuestros vuelos.
También nos recomendó lugares para comer o ir a tomar algo dentro del barrio. "

1040524,430245553,2019-03-30,198060186,John,"This is a lovely apartment which can comfortably accommodate four people. There is a bedroom with a queen-size bed and a fold out sofa-bed in the living room that makes a comfortable full size bed. The sheets pillows comforters and towels were all clean as was the whole apartment including the bathroom.  The shower and vanity are in one room while the commode is in a separate very small room. The kitchen was fully supplied and there is a pleasant dining space. The apartment is on what Americans call the third floor but Europeans call the second since the ground floor is usually considered “0”. So you have to walk up two flights of narrow spiral stairs. The apartment is quite secure. The door deadbolts and you have to go through two electronic doors just to get to the courtyard. The neighborhood is calm and quiet. Two or three blocks to the Charles Michel metro with a decent bakery on the way. Five minute walk to a Franprix grocery. Fifteen minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower. Closest taxi stand is at the metro stop but Paris is crawling with Ubers currently. We took a taxi from CDG to the apartment because they are so easy to access at the airport and took an Uber back to the airport for basically the same cost.
Altogether an excellent experience. I would strong recommend Christine’s apartment. Also she communicated very well. thanks Christine!"

It is very comfortable and functional place to stay for tourists and it's inside a very quiet building. You can easily walk to many attractions within 30/40 minutes and it is only 5 minutes walk from Vaugirad tube station.

18458053,257408914,2018-04-26,173186773,Xavier,Brando makes it easy for you from start to finish. Check-in was an easy process and his instructions were spot on for getting to the airbnb. He offers little tips at the beginning that are very helpful and he was pretty available to ask questions when needed. The best part about the place is the location. You are very close to the RER B metro station and a bus stop which leaves you close to the Eiffel Tower and if you enjoy walking like me you could easily get to many attractions within a half hour. The walk to the Eiffel Tower is a bit longer but with the metro and bus so close it doesn't matter! I highly recommend this location if you want to explore Paris as much as possible. Thanks again Brando for a great stay!
3936550,31092302,2015-05-02,4291008,Justin & Laura,Great place a 7 minute walk to Eiffel Tower and very close to the metro stop which pretty much takes you anywhere you want to go in the city.

4083514,160479834,2017-06-14,125628589,주희,"위치는 역 바로 앞이라서 너무 좋음.
지하철 버스 모두 가깝고 1층에 바로 상점이 있음.
엘리베이터도 있음.
단점이라면 부엌이 너무 더러워서 놀람.. 음식은 아마 못해먹을듯
수저 포크가 없고 전기포트엔 썩은물과 곰팡이가 가득 냄비도 완전 더러워서 라면 먹으려다가 포기할 정도....부엌만 무시한다면 나머진 꽤 좋은 숙소!

It was close to subway station and bus stop. There was a elevator and supermarket on the floor. But the kitchen was a little dirty... except kitchen it was nice cozy house."
16370598,193823245,2017-09-15,1395980,Paul,Quentin was helpful when we needed him we had issues picking up the keys few blocks from home at a locker the area was full of ghetto people and my parents got scared plus we couldn't pick up the keys. Fortunately Quentin fixed the situation. Beside that house was nice I gave Quentin feedback to avoid that key locker again hopefully this doesn't happen again to anybody. Place was clean and spacious and neighborhood good when far from key locker :)

Great location - we walked to most places and it was convenient having some shops nearby too.

4340240,59411720,2016-01-10,52297967,Talette,A very charming and nice apartment. I love the mezzanine and the concrete stairway which gives the apartment a distinctive character.  I really enjoyed staying here! Only a ten minute's walk to Marais and close to République. The neigbours are friendly - and Julie is very helpful and sympathetic. My warmest recommendations!
16033790,123399761,2016-12-29,63639465,Olivia,Adem is a cool host he let us check-in very early. The place is nice and clean and is well situated as it is close to a metro station so it is easy to go to the center of Paris. He also let us watch using his Netflix account (that's a plus haha)

17210946,167344966,2017-07-06,39124993,Bryan,Julien's place was very nice. The location is perfect for anyone who wants to be centrally located in Paris. The room itself was a studio apartment but it has everything you would need. The only thing I would suggest to Julien is to provide at least one more towel for the guests since we only had one. Other than that everything was perfect. Thanks Julien!
6223572,175996052,2017-07-30,14392726,Mathias,Beatrice many thanks to you! We had a great time in your apartment and your neighborhood. Everything worked well. Perfect home for us three.
5910106,497139497,2019-07-28,224689641,Susie,Are you kidding? Such a cool and amazing stay. So private and relaxing. We biked and roller bladed (our own) then hopped in the tub and drank rosé. It was rough. The view is stunning amenities all you need (use the mozzie net) water drinkable but wine preferred. Victor provides all info before the stay so you can coordinate with Uber or meet friends. Enjoy!

3624784,70909543,2016-04-22,167968,Pax,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
364761,195628252,2017-09-20,54257311,Alison,Maria was such a kind and helpful host. She shared suggestions on how to navigate the city and was very friendly! The location was also great- just outside of the Luxembourg Gardens and walking distance from St. Germain St. Michel Norte Dame and other great areas in the 5eme and 6eme. Downsides- the space was very small the bathroom was less than ideal and had a strong smell of smoke.
13947239,215215241,2017-11-28,8697141,Myriam,Très bon séjour. Appartement idéalement placé fonctionnel et propre. Très bon service et attention de la part de Clémence.
26614666,326891959,2018-09-23,4416535,Sandeep,Very centrally located at 5 min from Eiffel Tower. Don’t expect 5 star amenities but decent overall place with all you need for a good stay.
1055295,21722762,2014-10-22,22307511,Beverly,"We had a wonderful time in Laurent's apartment. It's quite a walk from the metro but along the way there's  the bakery 2 grocery stores fruit stalls meat shop chinese restaurant and coffee shop so its worth the walk. 
It was our first Airbnb and Laurent was our first host. He provided all useful information  for our Paris stay and he even allowed us to deposit our luggage at his apartment because we arrived early while still preparing the apartment for us his next guest. The apartment was very clean true to the description and has all that we needed for cooking. Laurent responded quickly to all our concerns. 
The location is great for exploring Paris. We look forward to our next stay "
13163874,159270112,2017-06-10,19427175,Heinrich,Rundum ein gelungener Urlaub. Christine war sehr freundlich und hat gute Tipps gegeben. Die Übergabe war völlig unkompliziert. Die Lage der Wohnung ist sehr gut und liegt zwischen mehreren Metrostationen. Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und mit allem ausgestattet was man sich vorstellen kann. Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen. Grüße von Laura Leon und Heinz
15140710,164898436,2017-06-29,88043443,Virginie Rose,"Wonderful host. Very good with communication and bought our son some baby food and left it in the fridge so she went above and beyond her duty. Everything was spotlessly clean in the most central location you could imagine and the climb up the stairs did us some good. 
We loved staying there and found it cosy but modern and super central."
4328848,217823103,2017-12-10,102036422,Laetitia,Logement idéalement situé.  Nous n avons pas rencontré laura mais tout était parfait et bien expliqué.  Nous recommandons vivement.
14618856,273228417,2018-06-05,171399,Marilyn And Alan,"This is a beautifully renovated hotel on the edge of the 12th.. Transportation is very accessible but many metro stops from the main sights so if this is your first trip to Paris consider the location. That said there are a lot of things to do close by. Some nice restaurants a beautiful park with a lake and a very interesting museum. 
The amenities were top notch The bathroom was spacious and modern. The breakfast was ample and good. The staff welcoming."
11213,198090688,2017-09-28,57927479,Yoann,Logement tout près de République dans un quartier sympa. Logement très sympathique. Je recommande vivement.
566867,531771346,2019-09-18,2420835,Sherwin (Doug),This is an authentic French apartment in a terrific location. Very close to Napoleon's Tomb and walking distance to Champs de Mars and the Eiffel Tower  just a bit farther. Two Metro connections and a nice supermarket (Franprix) are close as well. We met Rafic on arrival and he was very helpful with local tips including a nearby farmer's market. Cable TV had several English channels and Wi-fi was fast. This is a two floor walk up but stairway is wide with mid-floor landings. Building is secure and the area is totally  safe and very quiet. We dined in and dined out. If you want to have a real Parisian experience this is it!
24204397,534785333,2019-09-23,287348780,Jakub,Great place to stay if u are visting Paris solo :)
4043368,251619904,2018-04-08,1455386,Lucía,"There’s no better place to stay in Paris!!! This has been by far my best Airbnb experience for two reasons:

1. Alix: she is an ANGEL!!! Coming from the airport we got mugged in the underground. 4-5 guys stole my dad’s wallet (money documentation etc). Alix came straight away to the police station to help us and just be with us. When we went home that night there was a bottle of champagne 2 glasses cheese and a beautiful note that after our horrible first experience made us smile and forget about everything :) 
She invited us to an INCREDIBLE breakfast one day and she recommended us a lot of places to go. She was always making sure that we were fine :)

2. The house - the room was very clean and the bed quite big! There was a kettle biscuits tea jam and coffee :) The bathroom was also clean nice and cozy (with all needed). I went with my dad and we both felt like at home. 
Location: you are right in the middle of Paris so you can walk almost everywhere (metro and bus stops are near anyway) and as soon as you go out you are in the heart of Paris walking through streets that are plenty of nice places to eat :) 

As you can see I totally recommend staying here! Alix thank you so so much for everything!! I wish you the best and I hope you always have nice and respectful guests! Un beso!!! :)

Advice: Hold tight your bag phone and wallet in all the public transport stations!!!"
10333438,432929424,2019-04-05,236540809,Emily,This is a centrally located Airbnb near some very nice bars and cafes and a short walk to the Louvre and Notre Dame. My dad and I enjoyed our stay here very much. It is quaint and accommodating. It was very easy to find and check in and Fabrice gives great directions from the airport. If you are staying here make sure you are able to walk stairs! The spiral staircase is long and sort of tricky to navigate and I wouldn't recommend the stairs to anyone with any troubles keeping balance or climbing.
4051170,356953114,2018-12-09,199135916,Pauline,Value for money
1256694,47725821,2015-09-21,41483938,Cyrille,Nous avons parfaitement été renseignés sur notre séjour aussi bien par mail qu'au téléphone avec Steve. Au final nous avons passé un très beau moment dans ce superbe endroit. Fonctionnel propre spacieux calme deux chambres donnent sur une cour intérieure des plus silencieuse. Tout a été fait pour que notre séjour soit réussi. Encore merci à eux.
7597708,136846785,2017-03-12,13774947,Marianne,Petit appartement conforme à la description. Tres cosy et agréable. Calme et proche de la place de la Republique. Mylene a ete tres accueillante et a attendu mon arrivee tardive un vendredi soir. Je recommande!
391189,82889083,2016-06-30,44732429,Claartje,Philippe was very kind to help out on forehand with the reservation. My daughter and her griend went to Paris as a gift for their gratuation. There were very happy staying there. Very close to the metro station and Philippe made breakfast each morning. I hope they behaved Well. Thanks a lot Philippe! 
27679240,473767439,2019-06-22,20916550,Stefan,Wonderful quiet location sparkling clean and spacious for this price point. Nice kitchen and comfortable bed. I've let the owner know a few typical items and instructions that seemed missing. Over all good value!
1070851,283194300,2018-06-29,52999648,Julia,Nice apartment in a quiet area. Had a lovely stay.
15351357,116187096,2016-11-28,28238817,Nicky,Caroline was very responsive and understanding when we arrived a bit late due to a problem with a taxi. The flat is very convenient with the metro Jussieu just opposite (around 20 minutes from Gare du Nord) and a couple of bus stops. We walked to st germain etc. All amenities sunny flat smallish but fine and pretty. Pretty open views - we really liked it. You do have to climb 5 flights of steps so be ready for that if you have luggage. Caroline was super friendly and was able to allow us to leave our luggage which might not always be possible but was greatly appreciated- worrying about luggage always the downside of airbnb. Definitely would recommend and return. Thanks Caroline!
9839983,537175456,2019-09-28,274721030,Ruth,Anna es una amfitriona genial súper atenta. El pequeño estudio estaba muy limpio y fue muy fácil de encontrar gracias a las indicaciones de Anna además la zona nos ha gustado mucho y está muy bien comunicada.

Salvatrice was very welcoming and responsive in terms of communication. She was also flexible at times of check-in and check-out which was fantastic.
Would definitely recommend!"
7430476,161535173,2017-06-18,3570863,Vitor,Typical Parisian apartment very well kept by Raphaëlle. Has everything a single person or couple needs for a stay plus a very nice book collection. Communication was good. Definitely recommend!

607523,65331206,2016-03-13,6273935,Anna,My father and I had a great trip to Paris thanks to Stephane's lovely central apartment. The photographs do justice to the space. The bedrooms are large and the living area is stylish and spacious. Stephane arranged a friend to meet us and provide the keys and information. The area is great with lots of restaurants and shops near the apartment - we felt like locals!  Even though it's central the apartment itself is quiet.
11908897,421966940,2019-03-10,155400896,Joey,I would not hesitate to stay here again. The location is central and walking distance or a quick metro ride to anywhere you'd like to go.  It is modernly appointed and our hosts were very responsive to any questions we had.

La petite salle de bain est adorable est très fonctionnelle.
Tout est pensé pour un séjour agréable on peut même se faire un peu de cuisine.
Serviettes de bain et linge de lit tout est très propre.
La chambre est sous les toits au 6 éme étage et on a une jolie vue par la fenêtre on y voit la Tour Effeil!
Pour nous c'était un vieux rêve de dormir dans une ""chambre de bonne"" sous les toits et bien c'est chose faite!
Bref vous l'avez compris nous avons adoré et nous vous conseillons ce logement pour une escapade à Paris en amoureux. En plus le quartier est très sympa plein de restos l'opéra a deux pas et le métro Cadet aussi.
Une adresse à retenir. Merci Coco pour l'accueil!

The apartment is in a good location for getting around Paris and there was plenty of space for 3 of us to cook and chill out. Unfortunately for us the patio wasn't fully utilised due to inclement weather conditions but maybe next time! Thanks again Elisabeth.

Her place is a minute way to Monparnas station and 95 line bus which take you straight to Lourvre and Opera. We will definitely go back to her place for our next Paris visit.

21208392,363622112,2018-12-29,18560806,Benno,"Perfect Airbnb experience! Excellent communication in English and even a bit of German - very fast answers with all the details needed for a smooth arrival. Lorraine waited for us and showed us around and supplied us with all the tips needed. She also provided a very in depth list of recommendations which we used a lot.

The appartment and the building are very tasteful and comfortable. The kitchen is very well equiped and there are a lot of stores very close by.

We enjoyed very much the surroundings and all the little restaurants and stores close by. Subway is a 3 minute walk and many landmarks are in a walking distance. We can absolutely reccomend staying at Lorraines place and will do so again!"

J'ai été très bien accueilli mes hôtes ont pris le temps de me recevoir avec beaucoup de gentillesse. L'ambiance de l'appartement comme de la chambre est douillette.

22045800,476860056,2019-06-27,96077372,Hannah,Absolutely loved staying here location is not the best as it takes 30 minutes or so to get to city center by train but if you’re comfortable with metro transit it’s no issue. It’s a great space for the price felt like home for the time I was there.

2814372,19314000,2014-09-10,657454,Kam,"In the nutshell we had very enjoyable stay at this apartment. THANKS
1. Location
It's a great location that close to a lot of attractions (easy access via public transportations or by walking) it's convenience to almost everything (bank restaurants transportations grocery story and our favor bakery) make sure read the information sheet
2. Apartment
The apartment renovated well by paying attention to all the details it's new (of course it's clean) and modern. we like it (the decoration and design) it got almost everything we needed. (only thing we forgot to bring is the adaptor to charge our phone)
3. Communication
Host did very good job communicate with us and answered all the questions we asked (sometime even repeated questions) timely. 
One suggestion: maybe it's a good idea to have the WiFi p/w type it out (instead of handwriting).  
Thanks"
4697747,39906856,2015-07-27,20179854,Cara,The host was very punctual! He provided us a great central point to many different locations around Paris!

However is not that close that you cannot enjoy a restful night :)  (Note: Do not miss the copy of the New York Statue of Liberty in the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers around the corner)

Lots of amazing shops to window shop & cafes to people watch. The Marais is a very cool place sad to leave. Carole

C'est une personne accueillante et arrangeante qui veille au quotidien à rendre notre séjour agréable.
Son appartement est très bien situé pour ceux désirant se déplacer facilement dans Paris. En effet au pied de l'immeuble se trouvent un arrêt de bus(L24) ainsi que la station de métro Bercy(L6L14). À moins de dix minutes de marche on y trouve également la Cinémathèque la Gare de Lyon la Gare de Bercy(Ouibus/Flixbus) Bercy Village ou encore un parc pour aller s'aérer.
Merci Sylvie pour ce superbe séjour chez toi et à très bientôt."

The appartment was very clean i love that its very cosy very nice place for couples. The location was good 5 minutes walk from Reuilly-Diderot metro station and 7-8 from Nation. Few mins away is also a supermarket so we had what we needed nearby. So: apartment : 10+ our host Riadh: 10+ . Definitely reccomended.

676347,8704929,2013-11-12,5760156,Charles,Vincent is a lucky guy! His apartment in Paris is an idealized version of the perfect Parisian bohemian lifestyle. I wish I could have stayed for years and years - there was so much creative energy in the air. I stayed alone but the studio is plenty spacious for two people. It has all of the amenities that you could ask for and faces away from the street so it is nice and quiet a night. The neighborhood is quite nice and gives you a better sense of how real Parisians live. Don't hesitate if you like the look of this place - it also has a lift so getting in and out is a breeze! Vincent is also a really low key friendly guy. I wish I could have stayed a bit longer just to get to know him.
1110935,82493702,2016-06-27,14062383,Max,"Highly recommend!!
Mikael was very accomodating met us at the apartment after we got in a bit early and this allowed us to bag drop whilst the cleaner was finishing off. Great local knowledge and when we forgot some valuables after departing he was brilliant in meeting me back at the apartment to retrieve then run off to catch a train.
Apartment is in a good location easy access to public transport to get around close enough to walk to major attractions when the sun is out. Generous sized bedrooms apartment was clean and accurately reflected the photos online.
Merci Mikael"
31053973,404234904,2019-01-23,232018064,Cristobal,Es un studio cálido chico pero bien equipado. Tiene Smart TV con lo cual se pueden ver contenidos interesantes. Muy buena ubicación cerca a todos los puntos turísticos y muy lindo barrio.
3860377,77083553,2016-05-30,325713,P & S,While we didn't meet Rita in person she was very responsive to our messages and arranged quickly to have a friend meet us at the apartment when our train from Provence was delayed.  The apartment was just perfect for relaxing after a long day of shopping sightseeing and exploring Paris.  Exactly how it looks in the photos.  Great central location in the middle of a stylish (yet relaxed) shopping district.  Only downside to the apartment was the walk up the narrow stairs to get to the apartment (it is on the 4th floor) which was not a problem for us but for an older person might be difficult.  Otherwise a fantastic place to stay felt like our little home in the big city.  Would love to go back and stay again.
6772250,57712319,2015-12-28,51327402,Adam,We stayed five nights at the apartment. The location is superb. 10 minutes from metro Pompidoux or Notre Dame. The apartment is very cozy and well kept. Victor is a great host always available by phone or (Hidden by Airbnb) . Ideal for four people but we were six with kids and it was very comfortable. Kitchen very well equipped. Supermarket is just below the house. Lots of restaurants and cafes nearby. Would definitely return!

2373085,20948793,2014-10-08,13440592,Lijia,Chloe's apartment has all your basic necessities. It is also conveniently situated between the main metro lines which make it easy to travel about. Although we didnt have the chance to meet her (due to conflicting time schedule) she has been kind to leave behind recommended places for food and all your other must-know information. She has been prompt in her reply and kept in contact with us throughout our stay.  (:
5483145,246789817,2018-03-26,31163808,David,"We had a fantastic trip to Paris staying at this cosy apartment.  Only a few minutes walk from many of the big attractions and with a huge range of day and nightlife nearby it really is in a fantastic location and had all the facilities we needed.  

It was by the front door of the block and as you would expect from a city centre apartment there was some noise from the local area but we slept well!

Manuel was very welcoming and helpful and we felt very comfortable.  A few drinks left for us in the fridge were also much appreciated and enjoyed."

It was plenty of space (could have held at least 5 people comfortably). Marie was extremely quick to respond and was so accommodating to let us check in early. Definitely would recommend this space for anyone staying in Paris!
4766765,244990963,2018-03-20,167685711,Rohana,The apartment is suitable for a large family. It is a clean and comfortable new building excluded from the street. I definitely will stay there if I visit Paris again.

27700824,537844399,2019-09-29,6024994,Sergey,A very cozy place. It's located close to the Belleville metro station (literally 2 minutes walking) there are also several bus stops nearby. Cafes and shops are in walking distance and it's only a couple minutes walk to the Belleville park. Bekim is a great host he's always in touch and quick to respond.
36032400,496423453,2019-07-27,33409617,Ali,"First if you have a car don’t even think about coming to this place. The host didn’t show up and just sent her son Leo  to lead us to the place. He was so unhelpful to guiding us where to park our car. When we went into the apartment we were so surprised at how filthy it is despite the previous reviews that stated otherwise. It looked like as if it hasn’t been cleaned for months. There is dust on almost every interior including the silverware. We had to wash the bedsheets due to its unsantized state and wash every utensil/dish before we used it. One of the sheets changed its color completely because it was so dirty (now Veronique wants 50 euros for discoloring a nasty sheet that we did her favor to clean it). She continuously looks for other excuses for additional “damages” after we left. 

After we settled into the apartment my kids and I went out to the grocery store across the street to only come back to find Leo coming out of our apartment. He hesitated and claimed that he was only trying to fix the WiFi modems issue (which by the way we stayed our entire stay without WiFi due to the hosts lack of attention to what is guaranteed to be provided in the place). After this incident we didn’t feel safe to leave our important items in the apartment and felt right keep it in the car. Regarding WiFi availability there was none. I had to go out and buy internet for my phone and my two kids (total of $60). 
Every time we come into the apartment a horrible stench overcame which was disappointing after a long day out. Throughout our whole stay we never met the host."
7315172,58049995,2015-12-31,49866159,Janine,We had a fantastic stay in your apartment thanks Rudy and Benjamin. The apartment was more than accurately described as being exceptional; the communication with you was prompt and efficient; the location perfect - Printemps just far enough away while Jeu de Paume and the Grand Palais really close (when you're tired after seeing the exhibitions); Bar des Theatres a great find.... I could go on but I want to be able to get a booking for next time and not find you permanently full! Janine

26738117,401593334,2019-01-15,524301,Michael,Kevin’s apartment is a real apartment. Very well equipped with all necessities for cooking laundry and more. The neighborhood has fantastic restaurants. It is far enough away from tourist locations that it feels like a real neighborhood not just a place for sightseeing or shopping. Kevin was very responsive and checkin was a breeze. I’d be happy to stay here again.
3486020,355503964,2018-12-04,3899204,Greta,"Vincent's place is in very lovely and calm neighborhood close to lots of cozy restaurants. Flat itself is spacious and nicely arranged. It was also very easy to find. 

The only annoying thing was very uncomfortable bed but otherwise we enjoyed our stay."

15701977,514480728,2019-08-21,74051494,Cheryl,"Great place to stay that's close to the Louvre - walkable.  There's a supermarket that's a 3 min walk from the apartment; and 2 macaroons spot.   Check in process was extremely easy with the codes given to us from Stanley the day before.  We were able to get into the flat earlier to drop off our bags which we were very grateful for.  There's a washer/dryer in the flat - bring your own detergent!  

We saw reviews prior about the place only having one roll of toilet paper so we bought some of our own in advance.  You'll need it.  Place comes with other amenities like towels shower gel & shampoo; which other places we've stayed do not have.  The towels were clean and we weren't afraid to use them. The shower is huge; but I did wish there were some hooks for us to hang our wet towels afterwards.  

Beds were super comfy with black-out curtains; so you're not awaken by the morning sun.  

Great place to stay with great value!"
18647381,171399717,2017-07-17,129466611,Heather,Elizabeth was very helpful. Her place is lovely full of light and facing a garden. Practically it is near public transport and a grocery market and park. Quite a serene beautiful place! Loved our stay!

Von der Unterkunft sollte man nicht zu viel erwarten da es eine Personalwohnung ist und eine alte Schlafcouch als Bett dient. Wenn man die Wohnung nur zum schlafen nutzen möchte ist sie perfekt"
3607799,447211184,2019-05-03,22455908,Charles,This very small apartment is thoughtfully appointed with everything one needs to enjoy a few days in Paris.   It is quite amazing how well Max used every inch of the space to make it comfortable.  It is in a very quiet residential building.  We never saw or heard another soul during our stay.  Perfect!

16686723,402094336,2019-01-17,34957555,David,My wife and I had a descent stay at Charline’s place. The host was very nice and welcoming. If you just need a place to crash and don’t mind the bathroom being on a different floor this place is for you.  The shower is located at the hosts place so there are certain hours you’re able to use their shower. It’s all listed on the house rules.
19921016,234557055,2018-02-13,38067426,Jonathan,Amazing location! Trendy shops are right outside and yet the apartment is totally quiet and peaceful. It was perfect for our family of 4 (2 girls 6 & 9 years old). The beds were very comfortable and the apartment is stylishly decorated. We stayed 4 days and didn’t want to leave! It’s the perfect place for a long or short stay in Paris.
2709330,194285570,2017-09-16,58896373,Phil & Carolyn,Fantastic place location and host! Patrice was a generous host with information and bag carrying! His tips of the local area etiquette and where to find the best coffee really got our stay off to a flying start.  The location is perfect and just stepping out the front door from the sanctuary of the apartment you feel immersed in the French daily life.  Highly recommend!

Chambre confortable et propre avec vue sur le Centre Georges Pompidou qui malgré sa situation près de nombreux bars et restaurants reste plutôt tranquille la nuit. De plus le RER Chatelet-Les Halles est à quelques minutes à peine... 
Je recommande sans hésiter! Merci Alexandra."
17659557,320588007,2018-09-09,186122842,Art,Located on a classic Paris street with a great location. Walking distance to a number of Paris sites including the Louvre Conciergerie Seine River Notre-Dame Metro train and many restaurants and other Paris sites. Apartment has only 1 toilet.  Two showers that are tiny with not a lot of space to move around.
2530355,29964187,2015-04-15,25257411,Martyn,"When we arrived at the apartment we were met by the lovely Lilly who welcomed us and showed us around the apartment. It is a fantastic space with lots of room for the two of us to relax and enjoy the view! I had come to run the marathon and it was just ideal for me. The apartment is a short walk from Porte de Versailles where the Expo centre is and also a short walk from several Metro stations. We took the Metro from Dupleix to Charles De Gaulle Etoile several times and it was really quick and reliable. 
The apartment has some supermarkets nearby including one just down the street and a Monoprix not far away at the Beaugrenelle shopping centre. This along with the many bakeries close by and excellent cooking facilities in the apartment meant we were able to prepare meals for ourselves during our stay. But if you do want to eat out there are many bistros and restaurants in close proximity. And as for the clear view of the Eiffel Tower and its 9pm light show it is priceless. 
The neighbourhood seems a very resident-centric area which is nice. All of the locals are very pleasant and the area is clean and tidy.
I would highly recommend this apartment we would certainly stay there again. "
8246509,99207591,2016-09-04,63081716,Romina,El departamento es pequeño pero perfecto para una estadía corta con todo lo necesario.  Benoit es muy cordial y estuvo pendiente de que estuviese todo bien en nuestra estadía.  
16282851,145980134,2017-04-21,8373257,Samantha,John's flat is perfectly located near to the main tourist sights—and you MUST check out La Grande Epicerie de Paris & La Bon Marche across the street. More affordable markets are also on the same road =) We were comfortable as a family of 4; the couch bed has a super comfy padding that feels like a real bed and it couldn't be easier to assemble. It was very clean on arrival and we had all the amenities. There were some ants in the living room so we had to be careful not to leave food on the table or they'd find their way to it. Flat feels secure heating and internet work well (my husband works from home and had no issue). We had a wonderful stay and would recommend!
8601421,59296387,2016-01-09,33406734,Luca,My stay was magnificent. The apartment is perfect and so is the location. Melisande is an exceptional host: for her supports and her hints.

Le Canal St Martin  juste à côté vaut le détour. 
A 10 minutes maximum 3 boutiques Bio une crêperie sympa et... une boulangerie reconnue comme l'une des meilleures de Paris."

4023152,142410539,2017-04-08,31472570,Monique,My second stay at Antoine's perfect appartement. The neighbourhood is superb parc Luxembourg is across the street metro and several busses closeby. A very save place to stay what for me travelling by my self is important.   Antoine is extremely welcomming and he allowed me to stay longer because my train departed at the end of the afternoon. Thank you so much for that Antoine and for making my stay again perfect! Hope to come back soon!
1249964,544538352,2019-10-10,66944652,Erika,Mike's place is hands down one of the best places I have stayed at. Mike was more than accommodating to our every need and his place is incredibly well located. Absolutely recommended!

Julien is a fantastic host who replies really quickly when you contact him about something and helps you with anything you need. We really don't have anything to complain about! Had a fantastic stay and we were really taken care of :) 
34227043,540191441,2019-10-03,117712190,Tony,The house locates center of Paris. It is very convenience to go everywhere and have few minutes walking to the metro. The housekeeper showed on time but after he left he had responded only one time. The landlord is very nice and offered us helps. The only thing needs to improve is the cleaness of the house. It was not clean when we checked in and there were hairs found in the bath room sofa as well as bed. This is not good feeling. We had to do house cleaning ourselves to make the following days feel better.

24787035,285255167,2018-07-03,117520656,Jim,"Lucas was an excellent host and great help to make the most of staying in this excellent apartment and responds really quickly to any requests or questions with good suggestions on local restaurants and sightseeing. The apartment is in a great location for enjoying Montmartre and also getting into central Paris and the room was clean tidy and with very good facilities. The room is a little smaller than it appears on the photos but perfectly ok for 2 people as all is organized very well to maximize use of space. Nice view over Montmartre Cemetery from the windows of apartment and Lucas provided breakfast foods soft drinks and fruit when we arrived.... excellent. We were lucky to stay during a very hot week and Lucas even bought a floor fan to cool the apartment... a great host! 
Overall a really nice place to stay for 2 people and so many great places to eat and drink locally..... try Le Bossue for breakfast.... just fantastic! Many thanks Lucas and we’ll be back!"

The key is a little tricky but within the first day figured out how it works with ease. I would suggest this place for a couple mother-daughter or a couple with a child. It larger than most hotel rooms and we were able to have coffee in the morning and even cooked a couple dinners.

La localisation est parfaite : bouche de métro Pasteur très proche. Quartier vivant et sécurisant. Supermarché au pied de l'immeuble.
L'appartement est d'une propreté irréprochable : odeur de lessive serviette à disposition cuisine et salle de bain très fonctionnelles.
Une vue incroyable sur la Tour Eiffel et l'agréable surprise d'être dans un immeuble assez important mais très silencieux : les fenêtres donnent sur une cour intérieur et l'isolation est parfaite.
Merci Camille de nous avoir permis de vivre ce très beau séjour."

My stay in this apartment in Paris could have been better. I can not talk much about the hostess as she welcomed us personally. Contacts were made by email and phone. At check in a maid gave us some information and guidance. The apartment has a good location near the Louvre Museum and the decor is beautiful / modern however record some negative points: At check-in the apartment was not clean enough there was dirt in the dishwasher the refrigerator the bed and bath. To bathe no privacy because the tub is attached to the room without walls. The apartment is on the 5th. floor and the building has no elevator.

21907448,268590498,2018-05-25,97706734,Luke,Place was great in a great location. The only issue we had was with the 2nd toilet. After checking out the host tried to make us pay for damage to the 2nd toilet we declined and then they messaged saying it was in fact a problem with the water not being turned on. Make it clear on the listing exactly what is wrong with the second toilet/that it cannot be used to flush any paper. The four of us staying there ended up just using the one main toilet. Apart from that issue the apartment is beautiful and in a good location.

474725,40714628,2015-08-02,23451012,Shiona,"This is a lovely apartment in a good location - an easy walk from Gare de Nord 25 minutes walk/amble down to the Seine and pelnty of metro/bus stops around. Sarah responded quickly to emails provided a cot and suggested places for us to eat - Albion was very good. The apartment is spacious and well equipped and having the terrace in summer was great. We were a party of 5 adults and 3 children and there was enough living/dining space for us all although be aware that while the main bedroom is spacious the second double literally has room for a double bed and nothing else (the other two children's rooms are singles but one fitted a single bed and a cot the other has a single bed and another single bed that pulls out from underneath it). The road is quiet but there are shops and restaurants just a few minutes walk away so very convenient. 
There were a few issues after we left regarding a bin and a toy car -   they were quickly resolved. "
7041567,535357771,2019-09-24,187532897,Marcelo,El apartamento es muy hermoso y está en una ubicación inmejorable. Está muy bien equipado y tiene detalles que te hacen tener una estadia agradable y placetera. La única dificultad es el baño ue es muy pequeño y está separado de la zona de ducha y lavabo. Por lo demás es muy recomendable. No pudimos conocer a Elise aunque con lentitud siempre stuvo a nuestra disposición mediante wsp.

1098883,480233463,2019-07-02,29591573,Andrey,Отличный хозяин. Очень быстро отвечал и помогал по всем вопросам. Изумительный вид с балкона! Под окнами школа и дет сад поэтому долго спать в тишине с открытыми окнами не получится)) Очень удобно добираться до центра города - рядом метро и автобусы во все стороны. Торговый центр прямо в доме - очень удобно. Там же можно поставить машину на парковке.

O ap é pequeno mas ok para duas pessoas. O sofá cama é confortável. Não tivemos sorte com a limpeza do ap (fronhas usadas e qnd chegamos o ap estava sujo). O host poderia ser mais atencioso! Fora isso vale a pena ficar no ap!"
26870696,471268336,2019-06-17,84123236,Anjali,I love the location of this place. Amazingly situated as it’s surrounded by several metro stations like Bonne Nuvelle Chateau d’Eau Strasborg St-Denis. There are so many restaurants in this neighborhood that you wouldn’t have to worry about food options after a long touristy day. Marie is very accommodating and responsive too.
1549055,267577030,2018-05-22,171889705,Martha,The location is amazing! Literally a 7-10 minute walk to the Eiffle Tower and also to many bus stops where you can catch tour buses. Emmanuel also let us check -in early which was greatly appreciated after a long flight. Overall a good place for a short visit.

Così durante il mio soggiorno scendevo  alla fermata successiva: Marcadet Poissoniers che dista 7 minuti a piedi dall'appartamento e di sera è meglio evitare in termini di sicurezza.
Il proprietario non mi aveva avvisato dei lavori alla stazione Chateau Rouge anzi mi aveva scritto che forse era aperta!!!
L'appartamento è buono: ben arredato semi-nuovo zona sileziosa.
Pulizia scarsa: muffa nella doccia bagno poco pulito.

A perfect place to stay to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of tourist attractions. Gives you a glimpse into what it is like to really live in Paris.

the apartment is so beautiful and you can feel Camille's special touch in everything.
the location is perfect close to both touristic areas and also the local cool bars and restaurant.

8130026,409293717,2019-02-07,74363933,Maria Fernanda,"Everything was as described. The location is very central with everything important just few minutes walking.
Nevertheless we had a very bad experience: part of my family was leaving for Argentina on February the 7th at 3:30 in the morning. My husband took two suitcases to the hall of the building ( the door was closed of course) run upstairs for one minute and when he went down again one of the suitcases had disappeared. 
We run outside and saw nothing.
We found the police and told them and gave them my cell number and left for the airport to take my family.
Eventually the police call me and told me they found the suitcase.
I went to look for it made a deposition  and they gave it to me ( it had been opened and lots of things were missing).
MOST IMPORTANT THEY TOLD ME THAT THE BURGLARS LIVED AT 12 of the same road (rue st severin)!!!!! Just in the building beside!!! And that they would have known the code of the door!!!!
It really was a very stressful situation all of it: the moment they stole it  going to the police seeing the burglars all of it!!!! And I speak French!!!!! 
It was bad luck I guess!!!! Or the zone is unsecured...
Grate job the French police!!!!"

14054764,214018354,2017-11-24,6330693,Carol,This is a perfect airbnb for a single or couple. It is well outfitted & in a great location in Montmartre. Plenty of room; decorated in a warm & whimsical style & has everything you need. We had a small plumbing problem and Olga wanted to deal with right away; but since we were leaving next day we trust it will be totally corrected before anyone else stays there. Another trip to Montmartre we'd be more than happy to stay here again. Merci!

Metro is one minute walk from flat and great shipping area nearby. You can't beat this place for a great room for couple or two friends cooking at home to get by in Paris. Picard market  at end of cross road is where locals stock up for cheap but good food.don't miss out. If you've had freezer food in North America you'll be amazed with what you get in France! Jean Michel is a great host and very helpful. I'll be back someday!

We were also given a map where Vera marked all must-see places in Paris explained how public transport works and recommended what to do in her neighborhood (dinner supermarket. etc). The only thing we were a bit confused about: the only source of light is a lamp on a night desk no chandelier. But it`s not a big deal. 

Important thing is that thanks to Vera`s advices everything was super easy and we really enjoyed our stay!"

23639565,529020895,2019-09-14,193253342,Stine,"We had a really nice stay in Mèlissas apartment.
The apartment: Contains all you need for a pleasant stay. 
There is considerable noise from the nearby train tracks all through the night but wether or not that is a problem depends on whether you sleep lightly. Also the noise is considerably decreased if the doors to the balcony are kept close. It is however clearly stated in the description of the place so we were not surprised.   
Location: The apartment is in convenient distance to most major tourist attractions in Paris using public transportation.
Food: 10-15 min walk from the apartment the cozy area 'Bercy village' offers a range of different restaurants. Furthermore Mélissa also provides several suggestions in the information material she provides. 
The host: communication has been good and precise. We did not meet Mélissa or Mickael as they were on holiday but we were well informed beforehand and were received by Nadia who gave us all needed instructions.
Mélissa has made information material with everything you could wish to know for at stay in Paris and the nabours in the building were friendly.
All in all we had a good experience."

The room had everything we needed including a super comfortable bed a small refrigerator cooktop electric tea kettle and nespresso maker. The neighborhood is quiet yet very close to two Metro stops plenty of restaurants and shops. It was terrific to see the sites and then return to a quiet spot to rest knowing many options were just steps away. Particularly appreciated the local restaurant tips for those who have to be gluten-free!

6149651,248020640,2018-03-30,50527260,Monica,"Fraçoise and Jack were very kind and friendly with us. We enjoyed staying in Paris and having their place to get a peaceful rest after our long walks.  The detail of breakfast was amazing really healthy and delicious.  
The commute from downtown is easy and the variety of bars  restaurants bakeries and stores is very good. 
We arrived earlier than check in hour because our backpacks were so heavy and Françoise and Jack allowed us to drop off there until the correct moment. 

Thank you so much."

Olivia was really patient and kind even though we arrive a bit late. She gave us her top 3 best places to go at the area treat us with a bottle of wine and definitely we recommend her flat for a visit to Paris."
9369884,173949682,2017-07-24,126718415,Becky,"Perfect location! Just off the Main Street following the Arc Di Triomphe. 5 minute walk from Ternes station 5 minute walk from two grocery stores and 10 minute walk from the Arc Di Triomphe! Samir was very welcoming - his cousin was very informal and helpful in checking us in as we got there late at night it wasn't an issue at all. Tourist leaflets left inside the room which was perfect as they really helped us plan our day trips! Sofa bed was very comfortable and clean! Eventually we did the 6 flights of stairs without stopping! Kept us both very fit. 
Samir was a perfect host checked up on us to make sure everything was okay.
Would highly recommend this apartment - small but has everything you could need in it. Security was also very good with 2 big locked doors leading to an inside with a further door - 2 locks on the apartment door also. 
We both had a wonderful stay and would be very keen to return!
Thank you Samir."

5900117,197871532,2017-09-27,142745671,Jacq,Very conveniently located with lots of cafes and convenient stores just a stone throw away. The place was clean and simple modern and has all our basic amenities. The environment is safe too. During my stay there was 2 sleeping pillows which I personally found a little insufficient (but luckily I brought 2 of my own). But it may suffice if you don't need much. In the event you are craving Chinese food I would like to recommend Le Grenelle de Pekin nearby. It's by a HK chef and they do whip up a good hot meal! The lady boss is also very nice and accomodating. Patrice was also very humorous and helpful in his responses. I would totally come back to this place again if I come to Paris again!

35177203,525919158,2019-09-08,16311178,Sarah,Great location spacious for a Paris apartment but check in involved having to go to the agency and pick up the keys which was really inconvenient after a long day of traveling and with our luggage.
22118737,414965540,2019-02-21,195009102,Tomas,Excellent location close to the metro lines and quiet at night. In a local not very touristy neighborhood that had some great eats around. All the basics were met but nothing extra like shampoo. Noise from neighbors was loud sometimes but not enough to be very bothersome. Excellent communication.

房子非常有法国建筑特色浪漫有新意｡加之地理位置合适地铁站距离很近如果价格能低一点会是满分推荐的住宿地!但唯一感觉房内的鹿头标本和壁画作为女生有些小害怕可能是因为房子比较老的缘故｡但总的来说还是比较推荐的｡"

6998270,415271135,2019-02-22,14753515,Alexia,Very cozy and stylish place. Communication with Marie was made easy. The apartment is located very close to Bastille on walking distance.
63873,105323114,2016-10-01,16641384,Corey,Paula's home was everything we expected plus a little extra charm. we were greeted by a lovely woman on her behalf who made sure we were ok the entire time. We were a group of four and had more than enough space in the apartment. Such a central location with great cafes in the area. Didn't mind the exercise with the walk up either :)
5396,304659892,2018-08-10,1634006,Betsy,Everything at the apartment was in good working order.  Its ideal location makes walking to Left and Right Bank easy.  Proximity to! barges during Paris Plages along the Seine was wonderful!
109161,518283951,2019-08-26,95590730,Amanda,"Marie’s place is wonderful. The location is perfect - a couple of minutes from two metros and a short walk to the Seine. We stayed for two weeks and explored the Latin District thoroughly. 

The apartment has an easy to use washing machine and pully-system to dry your clothes so you can bring far less than you may think! The bed is extremely comfortable - even for larger folk such as my husband and I! There is plenty of space and a lovely atmosphere in the apartment. We cooked a couple of great meals there and made good use of the espresso machine (for ease bring some Nespresso pods with you. It’s the smaller style). 

Marie is very friendly and speaks excellent English. She welcomed us at the apartment and explained how everything worked. We saw her a couple more times when she dropped off some homemade treats. A very kind lady. 

Paris is a special place for me and my husband and Marie’s apartment has added to that immensely."
18999405,181213528,2017-08-12,86378924,Carine,"Très joli appartement bien décoré et aménagé. On s'y sent comme chez soi. Le spa n'était pas en état de marche mais cela ne nous a pas dérangé ... 
Clément a été très arrangeant sur les horaires d'arrivée et de départ.
Le seul défaut important est le manque de volet ou rideau occultant pour le couchage situé dans le salon. Le lever du soleil peut réveiller les hôtes.
Une télévision serait un plus bien qu'elle ne soit pas indispensable ;)
Avec la ligne de métro 14 situé très proche de l'appartement tout est facilement et rapidement accessible dans Paris."

Sam is perfect he was always in touch. All historical places were in a walking dictance. By the way the subway station and supermarket are just around the corner.

The room is very well decorated and feels very homely and comfortable to live in.  The terrace is perfect for couples to sit down and dine by themselves in the evenings.

However if you have a lot of luggage be aware that the stairs are very steep and narrow. I could get mine up but it was a bit of work.
25985795,430733529,2019-03-31,170254967,Lizet,I enjoyed staying at Josh the place looks just like on the pictures and the bed is very comfortable. The location is amazing I did not want to stay in a very touristic area but also wanted to be within walking distance to access things in particular the Eiffel Tower is very close. There is tons to do around there that you don't need to be even far away to enjoy the city.  I also like that Josh and his wife were very considerate of not making noise.  It was a great experience.

Anthony is a great hoster
From the time we booked he was giving us all the information.
He keep checking on us even after the check in to see everything okay.
For the subway for my appartement it was really close and not difficult at all to find it and security is really good nothing to worry about.
At night little bit noisy cause one window is next to the road.
Im really happy  
Thank u so much for everything 
It was a great pleasure to rent your apartment."

7480347,48523141,2015-09-27,39428636,Loma,I have only good things to say about my experience at Jeanne's flat.  Everything was beyond my expectations.  It was my first time using Airbnb and I was quite nervous but Jeanne & her home made me feel instantly at ease.  She sent me a detailed description of how to get from the airport to her house.  It was so nice and helpful It made me feel like I wasn't along in Paris and I could even bother her with non-house related questions:)  She was so nice and considerate.  She showed me my room and explained to me things about the apartment.  How to use the washing machine  how to make coffee :) She is so generous with her things.  She knew I liked to cook so she showed me her spices and oils etc.  She had also written out events happening in Paris during my stay and drew a map of grocery stores near by.   There is wireless internet that worked great!  She even bought me a croissant! Delish!  The house was outstanding.  So centrally located.  2 blocks from the pompidou center.  But It was also very quiet must be because it is so high up.  It was clean and tidy but also homely and had a great smell! The light is beautiful in her house.  She left for work soon after I arrived and then was heading back to the countryside where she spends most of her time.  So I only met her once.  But she emailed me to check to see that everything was going well.  There are two showers that were great.  I could even take a bath if I wanted.  I loved my mornings there most of all.  I opened the big window in the front room and I could hear the streets of Paris down below while enjoying my morning coffee.   The bed was very comfortable.  I rented the double bedroom. I hope to stay here again if I will visit paris and I recommend her place to anyone.

If you are looking for a cozy extremely well located and peaceful environment please don't look elsewhere! She is a very friendly and accommodating host communicates well in English and allows you to find a home away from home. The flat is located very close to the Goncourt Metro area and is a short walk to Canal St. Martin Republique square Oberkampf Hopital St. Louis and so on. There are loads of Boulangeries around supermarkets and eateries and transport connections. Well worth it!

2894529,57197408,2015-12-23,28807158,Carol,To answer the questions posed:  I was traveling with my daughter and son-in-law.  Upon our arrival we could not have been made to feel more welcome.  Although we did not meet Danielle her daughter met us at the apartment and made us feel right at home.  She also gave us her cell number if we needed anything during our stay.  The apartment itself was exactly as stated.  Loved the location...just a block off the busy streets but it could have been miles it was quiet and restful which was greatly appreciated after the hustle and bustle of the tourist destinations.  I honestly cannot think of anything further that Danielle and her daughter could do to make this accommodation any better.  I must add that the fabulous weather with sunshine and mild temperatures in December also helped to make it a perfect visit and for that I must thank Mother Nature.  Although this was our first trip to Paris personally I plan on returning in the very near future and I can only hope that Danielle's apartment is available.  
3393864,28561616,2015-03-26,7477202,Alyssa,This apartment is perfect for two people! My boyfriend and I had a fantastic time staying in the apartment and it is close to EVERYTHING.

12845423,531717482,2019-09-18,7833791,Pablo,Un desastre de alojamiento debido a que el dueño delega todo en una empresa turística cutre que no respeta la hora de entrada pero te exije salir sin ningún tiempo de cortesía para dejar incluso un rato una maleta. La ducha deja todo inundado no hay cosas básicas en la cocina de cortesía. Todo muy pretencioso pero poco práctico (muy parisino). No hay sitio para dejar nada e incluso hay maletas del anfitrión por medio. Lo único bueno es la situación del apartamento y que tiene ascensor.

6279391,271378307,2018-06-01,9433111,Anja,Wir waren für 5 Tage in Sokos Appartement und haben uns vom ersten Augenblick an wie zu Hause gefühlt. Alles ist sehr sauber und typisch französisch perfekt durchdacht auf kleinem Raum. Soko gab uns viele Tipps für Unternehmungen in der Umgebung. Wir würden jederzeit gerne wiederkommen.  
9297919,238858059,2018-02-27,39952247,Marco,L'appartamento che comprende un soggiorno due stanze da letto matrimoniali (alla francese) una piccola cucina e un bagno è molto confortevole e pur essendo arredato con piacevoli e simpatici mobili risulta molto moderno e accogliente. Il bagno è molto piacevole e ben arredato con una lavatrice e una doccia molto spaziosa. Quest'ultimo risultava un po' freddo perchè i giorni del nostro soggiorno erano fra i più freddì dell'anno. Piaceve tutto il contorno del cortile (si accede con due porte a combinazione e la porta d'ingresso a chiave) e delle scale strette ma caratteristiche. La posizione è già stata lodata nelle altre recensioni e confermo. Grazie Jen Magali per il bel soggiorno che ci hai offerto e che speriamo di poter rinnovare in futuro...
3715016,97976491,2016-08-29,15123401,Catherine,We searched endlessly for the perfect apartment in Paris. While there were other options in the area I can't recommend Guillaume's enough. Their friend Yasushi met us upon our arrival and was so nice being sure to explain everything and even carried one of our bags up the stairs. Guillaume even left us a bottle of wine (which my boyfriend used to propose with)! Guillaume was in constant contact with us to make sure we were having a great stay. This location was PERFECT. Mere steps away from tons of cafes (fun fact: we saw Macaulay Culkin walk by while we were eating at a cafe nearby the waiter said he comes in a lot) the metro (we used Filles du Calvaire) grocery stores and a market (you must get a sandwich from Chez Alain Maim Maim). The bed was so comfortable wifi perfect and the view was outstanding. It was absolutely amazing a real dream come true. If we come to Paris again Guillaume will be the first place we look to stay. 
15368228,252366222,2018-04-10,33891702,Stefanie,Das Appartment von Guillaume war einfach super. Schicker Stil und perfekt für 4 Personen. Sehr praktische Lage für Sightseeing in Paris. Auch die Kommunikation mit Guillaume war schnell und unkompliziert. Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder!!!

Il y a tout ce qu'il faut c'est joliment décoré et l'espace est très bien aménagé.
Le descriptif est loin de ce qu'il y a réellement c'est une fois sur place qu'on se rend compte qu'il y a tout pour que chacun ait son espace que c'est sur rez-de-chaussé premier et deuxième étage avec un wc et salle de bain à chaque étage.
C'est d'un calme surprenant pour Paris!
Et on peut profiter d'un jardin très agréable (si le temps le permet).
Un petit livret de bienvenue nous aide à appréhender le quartier qui est vraiment très bien lui aussi. Tous types de commerce (dont bio) à proximité.
Les voisins sont invisibles aucun dérangement.
Un grand plaisir partagé par tous ceux (on était 8) qui y ont séjourné.
Merci beaucoup de partager cette belle MAISON!

It has a small kitchen to if you’re looking to save money. There’s also a grocery store about a block down the street. Adam is a nice host. Make sure you’re clear on when you will be arriving to check in I believe there was some confusion for us. Bring a clothes line if you intend to use the washer. Otherwise it is a great place for your time in Paris. Would definitely stay here again.

Made our group feel very welcome. 
The apartment is very beautiful to bad there was only 1 room. However the area is very spacious. It is big enough for a group of 6. 
The only minus point is the sofa bed in the living room the bed is very thin and it makes noise. 

The Communication with Natalie and Raphael went great they are such a great host.

Thank you "

L' appartamentino è piccolo ma dotato di ogni comfort. Cucina basica ma completa divano letto molto comodo e facile da aprire e richiudere. Buona pulizia generale piccola televisione.

Район вокруг квартиры несмотря на то что  это 19-20 квартал является оазисом.  Были приятно удивлены. Много ресторанчиков  магазинчиков   вход в метро напротив выхода из дома. Квартира небольшая  ~35 м2   внутренний двор присутствует (очень красивый ). Душ в шкафу (кто был в Париже  тот поймет.  Квартира старая  в Москве мы это называем ' бабушкина квартира'.  За эти деньги впрочем весьма адекватно.

Lo studio si presenta lindo ed accogliente severo ma non triste!
Io e la mia amica (signore non più giovanissime) abbiamo apprezzato l'essenzialità della casa il posto dove riporre il nostro guardaroba l'efficienza degli utensili in cucina l'arredamento minimalista del bagno: insomma non manca proprio nulla!Anzi nelle nostre case oramai piene di cose futili ed inutili non viene rivalutato il necessario che c'è nello studio di Christophe."

He is friendly very helpful and accommodating. He welcomed us with some small sweets and provided plenty of useful information regarding places to see and affordable restaurants.
He is always available by phone to answer any queries or needs; he even let us use his washing machine and organised a limo for the return trip to the airport.

The apartment is just beautiful. Very clean and tastefully furnished. The kitchen is a big plus for anyone who wishes to save a bit of money but still enjoy the local food and wine.

We loved our stay at Alex's and we couldn't recommend it enough. We will definitely go back.
Thank you Alex."
595610,81187103,2016-06-21,47868318,Emma,Christine and Pascal were wonderful hosts. Very lovely and great communicator. Christine even helped us to the metro with all of our luggage and gave us a treat on arrival. Beautiful people. I accidentally took their info folder with me. Whoops! Sorry again. Posted back promptly. Remember you have to pay a cleaning fee when you leave otherwise clean apartment yourself. Would highly recommend staying here. 
1126838,300021997,2018-08-01,9822951,Chris,"Olivia was an amazing host. Her home is exactly as described. Bright sunny and ideally located for an authentic Paris stay. Ours was long (30 days) so it very much felt like home. Every day upon returning from exploring Paris we would climb the stairs open all the balconies and windows and just take in the amazing views in every direction while enjoying a glass of wine. I was traveling with my 16 year old so having the two bedrooms was perfect. There is also plenty of shared space with the sitting room dining room and kitchen. So on days when we spent more time in the flat it never felt too small. 

Getting from the flat to anywhere in Paris either walking or Metro was extremely convenient. We could easily stroll to Le Marais or Les Halles or Place de Republic or take a train anywhere as there were multiple Metro stations within a 5-10 min walk. 

We found the neighborhood to be lively and welcoming with plenty of options for eating out or shopping for a home cooked meal. When we return to Paris we will definitely stay at Olivia's flat if it is available. "

The toilet for the third floor is on the fourth floor which I didn't mind as much as the fact I couldn't fully stand in it. The location is not conducive to sight seeing. Their hospitality was severely lacking. Overall a horrible experience.

It was very close to all kinds of shops cafes and restaurants.  The place itself is very cozy as described but perfect for one or two people.  All the amenities were available and we were thankful for things like a coffee teapot and a television to watch the World Cup games.  We appreciated that both Coral and Darryl were very responsive to email text and phone and were ready for us even when we arrived earlier than check in.  The beautiful setting made our trip to Paris very enjoyable!

The location is fantastic and the apartment itself is quite charming with its slanted ceiling and rooftop views. The two beds were perfectly fine for us. The heaters worked great (our trip to Paris coincided with a cold spell in the city). We found the place to be clean and Nico was very helpful and easy to communicate with. The water temperature of the shower was the only thing we had some problems with: we had one hot shower and a handful of luke warm showers; that being said we didn't exactly know how to operate the water boiler and didn't care enough to call on Nico to help. 
Again thank you Nico! We would definitely stay here again. "

It's a rare treat to have such a large kitchen and dining table in Paris which I especially appreciated. The apartment is also very quiet (there was some construction noise from below but only during the day and never early or late so this didn't bother us). The flat is also in a great location--close to the metro the fantastic rue des Martyrs and other great shops and restaurants. Communication with Xavier was easy and he let us leave our bags after check out which we were super grateful for. I highly recommend Xavier's flat and will definitely stay here again in the future!

It is perfectly located in between the Oberkamf and Le Marais neighborhoods and is just a few minutes walk from the metro.  Le Marais has plenty of cafes shopping and a beautiful public garden and is just a ten minute walk away. In the opposite direction on Rue de Oberkamf there are plenty of bars and restaurants and we had a great night without even having to take public transportation.   For when you do want to explore the rest of the city you'll find that Marilou's apartment is close to the  major attractions in Paris.  We never spent more than 30 minutes on the train...

The apartment itself is very cozy and has all the amenities you need - Marilou herself was traveling during our stay but her friend Cathy was very helpful and made sure to show us around the flat and got back to us promptly via email if we had any questions.  Plus the store Marilou runs is located directly below the apartment and her son was working there in case we needed anything.

We highly recommend Marilou's apartment!"

19494374,528119920,2019-09-12,11017884,Sarah,This Airbnb is amazing perfect for one person or a couple. It looks exactly like the pictures very cute and cozy. Walking distance to cafes restaurants bars shopping and major attractions. Eleonora was an outstanding host she responded to my messages very quickly and provided me with extra amenities like a blanket for the park. I accidentally broke something in her house and she cleaned it all up for me quickly without hesitation. I would highly recommend staying here. My only regret is not booking it for longer!

11216851,533914140,2019-09-22,22458556,Ivo Marcos,Espaço muito bem localizado seguro e perto da principal rua da cidade! Anfitrião atencioso. Porém é um espaço adequado para 03 pessoas o quarto hóspede ficará mal acomodado no sofá cama que é bem desconfortável!
12164114,109220577,2016-10-20,82086972,Anja,"Die Unterkunft war wirklich genauso wie auf den Fotos abgebildet. Wir fanden das Bett sehr gemütlich und alles war sauber. Die Metrostation am Place de la Republik ist nicht weit entfernt. Das Viertel selbst war für uns nicht so interessant aber als Ausgangspunkt für weitere Unternehmungen ist die Lage gut. Fred war ein sehr netter und offener Gastgeber und überaus hilfsbereit!!! 
Solltet ihr mit dem Auto nach Paris fahren kann man das Auto für 10 € pro Tag im nahen Renaissance Hotel unterstellen. "
6443625,453236824,2019-05-15,54214654,Mona,"Vielen Dank Nathalie für den Aufenthalt in deinem Appartement. Nathalie war stets erreichbar und half bei Problemen sofort weiter. Leider ging bei uns das Wlan nicht wofür aber Nathalie nichts konnte. Sie bemühte sich gleich um Ersatz welcher jedoch in dem kurzen Zeitraum unseres Aufenthalts vom Telefonanbieter nicht ermöglicht werden konnte. Die Wohnung ist sehr klein vor allem das Badezimmer. Leider konnten wir den Herd nicht benutzen da es Probleme mit dem Strom und der Sicherung gab. Ansonsten kann ich die Unterkunft empfehlen da sie sich in einer top Lage befindet und die Gastgeber wirklich sehr nett und hilfsbereit ist. 
Man ist zu Fuß ungefähr eine Minute von Notre Dame weg. Es sind viele kleine Läden Bäckereien und Metrostationen in unmittelbarer Nähe der Wohnung. Ich würde die Unterkunft wieder buchen."
801583,276219764,2018-06-13,171341291,Marlise,Great location bus line at either end of street walking distance from many  museums restaurants  food shopping bakeries.  Apartment light clean and adequate for short stay.  Only complaint is the lights by bed  should be lower for reading.

8401819,156363279,2017-05-30,4127351,Rebecca,"We had a great stay at Stephane's apartment. It is in a very cool vibrant and fun area of Paris with lots of amazing bars and restaurants all within walking distance.  The apartment is also very close to a metro station which makes getting around easy.  The apartment is spacious and well equipped - especially the kitchen.  The sofa bed in the lounge is very big and comfortable.  Stephane's communication with us was faultless - he responded to everything very quickly and was always very helpful.    
The only slight drawback (as Stephane mentions in the description) is the noise - it is very loud.  We had to sleep with the windows open as it was so hot whilst we were in Paris and the apartment is in a very noisy area.  Take ear plugs and you'll be fine!   "
63881,275625785,2018-06-11,63520160,Елена,Самое замечательное в этой квартире - ее расположение: рядом метро автобусные остановки. Добраться в любое место не проблема. В шаговой доступности достопримечательности 5 4 округов а также сетевые маркеты и буланжерии. Не подойдёт тем кто любит спать в тишине и не любит взбираться на 6 этаж по винтовой лестнице. Приятного времяпрепровождения!
5444447,78702211,2016-06-08,53675700,Sarah,We absolutely loved staying at Adel's flat.  He greeted us when we arrived and made sure that we had everything we needed to feel comfortable.  The flat was laid out wonderfully the pull out sofa was very comfortable as was the bed.  The kitchen was equipped with everything we needed to cook our meals which helped save money but not eating takeaway for all our meals.  Around the corner is a street market which had fruits vegetables and meats.  Being able to stay at Adel's flat made our trip to Paris so relaxing and just like we were living in the city :)

30711765,362364573,2018-12-26,117226052,Iris,This house is super excellent!!! The location is pretty good and only 3 minutes walk to supermarket and metro station and by subway it only takes around 10-15 minutes to Luvre Effel Tower and other sites. The whole building is located in a very safe and quiet area. The room is very clean and decorated super nicely just as the pictures showed. The host Kike is super nice and patient and he provided detailed suggestions and a lot of help for our trip. My friends and I really enjoy our stay here and I will choose this house again when I go to Paris next time! Highly recommended!!!
12892570,160447166,2017-06-14,15062212,Pedro,The place was very comfy and its location was quite convenient. Both bed and linens were very good and we slept very well. The place is not too big but enough to sleep and have a small snack. After all you don;t want to stay and eat at home in a city like Paris. 
27830581,486159980,2019-07-12,146343918,Wanderson,O apartamento de Frederic é lindo espaçoso seguro. Têm todas as comodidades que um hóspede busca. Você se sente em casa. Frederic é super prestativo atencioso educado. O check in é simples e fácil. O espaço é próximo de transportes públicos supermercados padarias e todo tipo de conveniência. É um refúgio a noite depois que se aproveita muito a cidade. Ficamos extremamente satisfeitos e voltando a Paris esse é o local onde gostariamos de ficar.

650980,484686907,2019-07-09,170908468,Stacey,We enjoyed our stay in Marais. The area is very central and easy to travel from. Metro station on the next corner and lovely restaurants nearby. The apartment was as depicted in the photo’s. Then bed was not as comfortable as expected however very livable. The shower is incredibly tiny though only big enough for one person. We had a pleasant stay and Sophie was incredibly helpful and quick to respond.

1357982,148536755,2017-05-01,67770413,Maggie,Great place! Has everything you need if you plan on sightseeing for most of the day. Great area as well as being close to a metro is really all you need. A bit of communication errors at check in and then miscommunication about cleaning but I would still recommend this place to anyone visiting Paris!

33853191,449735043,2019-05-07,114970973,MacCoy,Great value for money. Very close to the metro #2 line which is very handy. Just down the street there is a beautiful market street with 4-5 Cafes. Please note this apartment is on the 8th floor (9th floor for my American friends)  There is no elevator so you must carry all your luggage upstairs and when you return home each day. There is also a gap in the door where someone could look through and see you sleeping (creepy!) I just hung my coat in front of the door to solve this issue. The building is VERY quiet and peaceful. If you're a solo male traveler would recommend this place.
9369884,81746951,2016-06-24,6052283,Lucille Et Antoine,Studio très bien placé dans Paris. Le métro est tout prêt l'arc de Triomphe l'agréable bois de Boulogne et son jardin d'acclimatation. Le douche est très agréable !

The apartment is beautiful you can spend a lot of time just looking at the books all over as well as the beautiful art on the walls.
The location couldn't be better. Just in the middle of everything walking distance to main sites the Seine Museums... and the best just go downstairs for cheeses and wine. It has elevator   and the WiFi worked very well. we will go back for sure. thanks Isabelle and Herve"

We had all we needed for a comfortable stay.

2725795,288099409,2018-07-09,116269046,Jun,Christine's apartment was flawless. There was ample space for 4 people and very spacious. All amenities were provided and we couldn't have asked for more. Moreover  it was conveniently located next to a metro station and a  bus stop directly to the Eiffel Tower! To top it off the view from the balcony was amazing (albeit there are six floors of stairs). I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a cosy place in Paris.  
22063324,217212484,2017-12-08,148374282,Lingtao,Its small but very cozy. The host is a very kind man and we had a very mice talk. I strongly recommend it!

9726461,462410490,2019-06-02,9055511,Ryan,"Remy’s place was well suited for all my needs in my recent trip to Paris. 
The subway (line 12) is <5 minutes walk and will take you straight to the center of Paris or allow you to easily transfer to reach all of Paris’ popular destinations. 
There are plenty of good restaurants bakeries grocery stores etc just outside his building. 
In the evenings I would take a 10 minute stroll to Montemarte to sit on the steps in front of Sacre-Coeur and sip on wine or beer with both the locals and tourists while watching a local artist play music or other performance. 
Overall it was a great place to unwind and relax in Paris."

It's only 13 minutes by bus to Gare du Nord and by tube you can travel very quickly throughout the town.
Our hosts are very nice people. Pierrie showed us around in the neighbourhood and explained us the most important things which was very helpful. 
The room is small but good for stay of a few days. A good bed.

23446827,255656747,2018-04-21,24118801,Peder,Location is the best. Awesome view of the Eifel tower and Sacre ceour. Perfect little balcony. Very close to metro. No traffic noise. Apartement is genuine and occupied by owner at non-airbnb-times. Responsive host. Safe neighborhood. Great cafe boulangerie fromagerie and grocery store within 100 metres. Could not wish for a more perfect place. Honestly. I would go back to Gwenns place anytime and every time. Merci boucoup.
3655903,156579512,2017-05-31,3799076,Jennifer,We loved the feel of Fred's apartment. It was just as pictured -- a french country feel in an urban oasis. We especially loved the green balconies  pretty views and fun neighborhood. We had difficulty with check in and check out so I would advise that you discuss those details with host in advance. Additionally we were traveling with a 1 year old and it worked out just fine but we would like to emphasize that this apartment is not childproofed and it does not purport to be. We thought it worth mentioning that the bedroom is an open loft which is a danger for a new walker something that should be noted in properties description.

11331287,302156579,2018-08-05,129018455,Katja,Die Wohnung von Myriam ist klein und typisch Französisch. Durch einen engen Flur kommt man in den Wohn- und Schlafraum. Die Wohnung bietet trotz ihrer Größe genug Platz für 4 Personen. Die meiste Zeit verbringt man sowieso in der Stadt selbst. Die Metrostationrn sind fußläufig innerhalb von 5 Minuten zu erreichen. Es gibt in gleicher Entfernung einen Supermakt (Monoprix) und einen Bäcker um die Ecke sowie einen McDonald's. In der Wohung selber ist alles vorhanden was man für einen Aufenthalt braucht. Handtücher Bettwäsche und Küchenutensilien sind auch da. Es gibt nichts zu meckern. Wir waren sehr zu Frieden und würden jeder Zeit wieder zu Myriam fahren. Das einzige was vielleicht ein kleines Manko ist ist dass die Schlafcouch etwas quietscht und die anderen weckt wenn man nachts einmal Aufstehen muss. Aber für ein paar Nächte ist es aushaltbar! 
34596026,474523545,2019-06-23,56620649,Dominique,Très sympa et réactif Antonin fait aussi tout pour s'adapter aux contraintes voyageurs. Studio petit ancien mais propre et fonctionnel pour une personne.

Good hosts and always trying to solve our problems."

L'emplacement du studio est très bien situé supermarchés à 2 pas 2 stations de métro à quelques minutes à pieds. Si vous prenez le temps de vous promener dans le quartier vous découvrirez plein de bonnes adresses pour faire vos courses et manger de bonnes choses. Le studio est bien fait et semble plus grand que ce que nous avions imaginé. Nous reviendrons très certainement. Merci!
25822943,456743136,2019-05-22,252186344,Karolina,The place is located close to a metro station which makes it easily accessible. It's very cosy and tidy equipped with all necessary things like plates pots hair dryer etc. There is a slight issue with the humidity of the apartment and wall are indeed very thin. Overall a nice place for a short-term stay.

35780712,499241133,2019-07-31,33438746,Vincenzo,The location of this apartment is amazing and the space itself is great. Can’t beat that. However the bathroom needs some serious cleaning done to remove black mold from the walls. I would contact Jordan to make sure that this has been done before staying here.
19032207,257763792,2018-04-27,117134891,Andres,El piso era tal cual las fotos mostradas la ubicación era perfecta ya que teníamos dos líneas de metro a unas cuadras.  Todo funcionaba perfectamente el único inconveniente fue que teníamos mal el número de la persona que nos tenía que dar la llave y por eso se nos complicó un poco el ingreso al piso. El resto todo perfecto y es un lugar cómodo para dos personas.

25505934,465070920,2019-06-07,4154496,Melissa,"Hortense is a great host. Her communication and instructions were spot on and not difficult to follow. My booking was very last minute as my previous host had cancelled at the last minute. Hortense responded really quickly to confirm my booking. 

The apartment is in a fabulous neighbourhood. Central to everything but as it is in a passage it is very quiet. It is also very bright sunny and airy. 
Metro supermarket & great cafes are very close. The restaurant/wine bar right at the front door is wonderful. If you plan to eat in the shop around the corner makes the most amazing fresh pasta. 

The bed and pillows are very comfortable and the apartment is well equipped with everything you could need for a comfortable stay. I would stay here again. 
Many thanks Hortense!"

Ero a Parigi per turismo insieme a mia moglie e mia figlia di 16 anni.
Siamo arrivati con l'auto e abbiamo portato le biciclette per poter visitare in un modo diverso Parigi. 
L'appartamento si trova in ottima posizione vicino alla fermata della metropolitana per la torre Eiffel. Ci sono nelle vicinanze negozi per fare la spesa. E' vicino alla Senna ed è facile accedere al lungo Senna per delle belle passeggiate. 
Jerome è stato gentilissimo. 
Ci ha permesso di fare il Check In alle ore 9 il giorno di arrivo e il check-out il pomeriggio quando volevamo.
Abbiamo trovato al nostro arrivo della frutta e delle brioche ad attenderci.
Avevamo le biciclette per poter visitare Parigi e ci ha permesso di poterle parcheggiare in un vano condominiale chiuso a chiave. 
Ci ha fatto un grande favore.
L'appartamento si trova al secondo piano c'è un giardino condominiale chiuso con dei cancelli ed è custodito in modo ottimo da un portiere.
E' come si vede nelle fotografie una grande stanza dove c'è un tavolo un divano letto un materasso-futami che funziona da secondo letto sempre matrimoniale. Mentre il divano letto è molto comodo il materasso-futami sul pavimento è un pò scomodo. C'è una bella televisione e il wifi funziona benissimo.
C'è un piccolo cucinotto dove poter cucinare e un bagno dove la cosa più bella è l'acqua sempre caldissima per poter fare la doccia. C'è anche un terrazzino che non abbiamo usato per niente in quanto nei giorni in cui ci siamo stati noi il tempo è stato abbastanza brutto.
L'appartamento è come dice jerome pulito ma vecchio e non è una clinica svizzera.
Per un massimo di 4 persone è ottimo."
4531870,229730900,2018-01-25,9748287,Pauline,J'ai apprécié la gentillesse et la flexibilité de Soazic. L'appartement est agréable avec une jolie vue et très bien situé !  L hyper centre est accessible en 30 minutes de métro... et le quartier le 11ème arrondissement est très sympa
2049794,538704823,2019-09-30,28450958,John,Great location. Thoughtful touches in decor.
16687693,230405350,2018-01-28,14826349,Hirad,Paul’s place is an excellent studio in the heart of Paris. It is small but it is very tastefully decorated. We were very happy to stay here and it made a huge difference to our trip. I highly recommend this place for 1-3 people.
1997918,268515281,2018-05-25,96417976,Eduardo Alcide,Dpto. Acogedor y muy bien ubicado. Recomendable
16268793,267959027,2018-05-23,62478169,Caty,Excellent location and competitive pricing for such a wonderful location for food shopping sightseeing and metro/underground transport. Also quick walk to Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Lorenzo was also extremely quick to respond to any and all questions which made my mom feel at ease on her first trip to Europe and so is much appreciated for his attentiveness. If I go to Paris again this is where I I’ll stay!
20953162,253855769,2018-04-15,133552923,Aimie,L'appartement est agréable et bien situé. Louis est très arrangeant dans les horaires d'arrivée et de départ.
33227298,540273055,2019-10-03,293929139,Hyonhee,Good location for value and Miel was lovely. But a bit of hygiene issues. Bedding and pillows weren’t kept so clean especially the sofa bed. We tried to convert it into a bed only to put it back immediately as it was too dirty beneath the sofa and didn’t even want to touch the cushions... and it could be a bit cold at night even with our own blankets. Re: amenities the description was pretty accurate but to a minimal level. Better to bring your own stuff because shampoo was running out and soap was too try and that’s basically all you can get.
9486445,76355911,2016-05-26,22817094,Mark,"Staying with Hélène was definitely the highlight of our trip.  

 The location is excellent and they couldn't have been more welcoming. I'm actually afraid that if I tell everyone just how good it was to stay here that I will never be able to stay there again because it will be booked solid but Hélène and family were so nice that the truth must be told. It's only a few minutes from both regular metro and RER so you can get there easily from CDG airport without paying a fortune.  

 And the view Is. Simply. Amazing.

  There is a restaurant around the corner that is one of the oldest in Paris (est. 1512!) and that has the most amazing food I have ever eaten.

 My daughter and I are both already looking forward to staying there again as soon as we can make it back to Paris!  Can't recommend highly enough!"

We didn't met Clotilde but she organised everything for our arrival and our stay."
31376914,539400119,2019-10-01,19033940,Robin,We stayed at Éloïc’s place for one month in September 2019. He is an amazing host and the place is cosy. There are lots of good restaurants and cafés in the surroundings. Also other nice areas in Paris (Montmartre Roche Canal St. Martin) are in 20 minutes walking distance. The apartment is very quiet even though it’s located in a lively neighborhood. Also it’s right next to the Barbès – Rochechouart metro station which basically enables you easy access to the whole city. We would definitely would come back here. Cheers!

Gabrielle nous a très bien accueillies très gentille et disponible elle nous a tout expliqué et très rapidement répondu les quelques fois où nous l'avons sollicitée par sms.

22382338,469150770,2019-06-14,242231642,Anna,Für einen kurzen Aufenthalt ist das Apartment echt okay. Es ist nur fünf Minuten von zwei Metrostationen entfernt allerdings sollte man sich nachts nicht zu lange alleine auf den Straßen herumtreiben. Es ist kleiner als die Bilder einem vermitteln aber zu zweit kommt man gut klar. Das Bett ist etwas durchgelegen und wer mehr Handtücher als nur eines pro Person möchte sollte dies anfragen. Alles in allem ist das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis für die zentrale Lage echt angemessen.
23084325,453255692,2019-05-15,243890134,Andrea,Great place to stay! It is in a great location in Montmartre and not far from the metro! The workers are friendly and will help you find where you need to go!
31323880,449311522,2019-05-06,257118646,Teresa,The description is accurate that it is suitable for families and the location is excellent if you want to use public transport as parking your car is a nightmare and costly. We had to park half a mile from the appartment.  The host supplied plenty of toiletries. The appartment and bed sheets were clean although duvet covers are needed and more pillows and blankets. We were surprised at how tiny the space is with the toilets and even closing the door on one of them was very difficult. We also had an issue with hot water for showers in the evening
27482459,338003646,2018-10-18,2851336,Maria,Will recommend. It’s a great location clean and Calorine is super friendly and her restaurant recommendation was great.

10672530,186018775,2017-08-23,23163043,Josef,WE absolutely enjoyed staying in Felix' place and we also can highly recommend staying there. Felix gave us a lot of inspirations about where to go and when we had a question he immediately responded. Merci
21360916,284233285,2018-07-01,32092029,Elizabeth,Perfect location for discovering Paris.  It was quiet at night and had a lovely patio. Marielle left very helpful directions.  It was easy to get to the metro from the apartment.  The bed was comfortable and the apartment had everything we needed.
11791883,256075963,2018-04-22,4068634,Heather,This place was perfect! Located in a safe excellent area! It was quiet at night (which means great sleep) and very clean. It’s definitely small but adorable and perfect for what I needed! I’d recommend it to anyone :)
10786057,222947610,2017-12-31,52593514,Omolade,Claire's apartment was a very nice and comfortable stay for our family of six and is well-located not too far from Abbesses and Montmartre. I appreciated Claire's responsiveness and attention to detail for many aspects of our stay including sleeping arrangements and travel itinerary.
27333414,319380317,2018-09-06,5476506,Julie,Very nice flat. Elegant and bright. Great location in an upscale neighborhood of paris. All the parisian charm with hardwood floor and moldings.

5444447,54707163,2015-11-23,15280071,Alan,Adel was very kind person. He explained us all thing which were interested for us. Also we could leave our laggage till evening. The neighberhood is very quiet  with cages and stores. The metro just 3 min by walk. 
309092,47063126,2015-09-15,20392640,Çağdaş,The apartment is very good condition and the location is perfect. Recommended to stay. Also Jean is a gentlemen guy that he left a bottle of champagne in the apartment . 
4328848,91505528,2016-08-05,77984615,Aaron,Laura was a great host - the apartment was in an incredible location surrounded by great places to eat and drink.

32204591,439480358,2019-04-19,243430053,Gianluca,Buenos servicios sanitarios y aseo. A pesar de ser compactas las habitaciones cumplen su función aunque pueden ser un poco calurosas sobre todo si no tienen aire acondicionado.
9089644,54784517,2015-11-23,22113337,Seung-Soo,"Un séjour fantastique! La localisation de l'appartement me convenait parfaitement car il se trouve près de la gare Montparnasse! En plus c'est vraiment 10mètres de la sortie 1 de la station Plaisance! L'appartement est tout propre et le quartier est aussi très vivant! Aucun soucis pour les courses ou le repas! La hôte est vraiment acceuillante. La cuisine et la salle de bain sont très bien équipées. Rien à critiquer! Je vous recommande sans hésiter!

That was fantastic experience! The location of the apartment was perfect for me b/c i needed to stay near the Montparnasse station. It's literally 10 meters from the subway station. The apartment was really clean and its town was also really dynamic. No worries at all for shopping or going out for dinner. The host is really kind as well! The kitchen and the toilet big and convinient. Nothing to complaint. I recommend here seriously"
6985770,163647910,2017-06-25,19517579,Alice,J'ai passé une petite semaine dans l'appartement de Karine lors d'un déplacement professionnel. L'appartement est lumineux et très agréable à vivre avec une cuisine équipée et une salle de bain super fonctionnel. L'appart est situé à 5mn de Républiques et des pleins d'endroits clés à Paris.

The apartment is very tiny but at the same time there was all necessary for preparing my meals and I  had my coffee in mornings.
The location is great very close to Montmartre and many shops around."
10110523,243262744,2018-03-15,40194983,Kevin,Perfect safe location in a busy part of town - yet the top floor (with a LIFT!)  courtyard-facing direction ensures a very quiet stay for the city. The space was exactly as pictured - sparkling clean and modern with a very comfortable bed. Well there was one difference - there was different art on the walls as one of the hosts is a talented painter. Our questions were answered immediately and they were quick to help us extend our stay when family plans changed after we'd already booked a few days. They also proactively offered to clean or to refresh linens/ towels (all provided) etc. during our 5 day stay. The bedroom is small because the bed is as large as possible - a trade I'll take every time - but it doesn't feel claustrophobic at all. It opens via two large french-door windows to a lovely balcony that makes the space feel much larger. Zero complaints and only good things to say about Fredo & Dan's place. Hope it's available next time we're in Paris!
878910,68432562,2016-04-04,57790300,Aya,"Thank you for let stay us for the weekend! located is great and room is clean. We had good time to stay there.

2449004,13178929,2014-05-21,4208945,Joe,We spent 4 really great nights in Matthieu's beautiful apartment. Matthieu and Marjorie were great hosts very friendly offered good advice about the local area and were very flexible with check-in/out times. The apartment is spotlessly clean and amazingly quiet and peaceful for such a central location (Belleville metro is right outside the door). The location itself is perfect in one of the most vibrant and interesting parts of the city. You are surrounded by a great selection of restaurants bars galleries street markets and some lovely parks or the canal are within easy walking distance. We would definitely recommend a stay here.

Next time I return to Paris I will for sure stay with Joseph again!

11213,53337266,2015-11-08,9804506,Josefine,Mathieu's apartment was ideal for our group of friends traveling together. Nicely located spacious and with a lot of details and things to   look at.

In this apartment you feel as though you're living in paris not just a tourist. I loved the culture of the area and all the close amenities. My boyfriend and I stayed here two weeks and it was nice to come home to some peace after the hustle and bustle of the center city. Thank you Uriel!

4198408,176985587,2017-08-01,60768964,James,Montmartre is my favorite area in Paris and Quentin's place is located perfectly in Montmartre.  It is close to shops restaurants and bars but the street itself is quiet.  The living room was a good size and comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped.  We found butter and water in their frigo and olive oil and such stuff on a self.  Quentin's directions for entry into the building along with the door code was easy to follow. We did have difficulty finding the key to the door but once finding it all was good.  So be sure you understand the directions to the flat's door key.  The flat was advertised as having a/c which it doesn't.  That was part of our search criteria.  Fortunately the weather was cool for the first week in August. If not requiring a/c  I recommend the flat for a couple or a family of three.  It would accommodate three adults comfortably. 
24587390,325008612,2018-09-18,143383932,Nina,"What a great flat ! We had a wonderful time in Paris thanks to Justine’s stylish appartement. Well-equipped cosy well-located next to restaurants bars supermarkets etc. and a charming terrasse for drinking a vin rouge at the end of the day. Nothing left you could ask for. There‘s no need for chichi- it‘s just an authentic place where you can feel home (and even a bit like real Parisians).

We would (and will) definetly come back.
Highly recommanded for couples to discover the city and the parisian way of life."
15560796,125176495,2017-01-04,935958,Wachiraya,"The apartment is clean comfortable and has a well decoration. Only few steps away from Pigalle Station which connect you to most of the main attractions. There are many restaurants and supermarkets around the place. 

In short I had a very satisfied stay but please note that the apartment is surrounded with sex shops. "
18310031,155111219,2017-05-27,17603720,Stephanie,"Die Unterkunft war wirklich sehr schön und geschmackvoll eingerichtet.  Es war sauber und man hatte alles was man brauchte. Da ich mich am Tag vor der Reise am Fuß verletzt hatte waren die vielen Stufen (ca.95) etwas anstrengend.
Die Wohnung ist eine Dachgeschosswohnung und wir waren dort als es ca 27 Grad am Tag war. Durch die vielen Fenster war aber eine Querbelüftung möglich weshalb es trotzdem angenehm und gut auszuhalten war. Die Gegend ist recht lebhaft wovon wir - bei geöffnetem Fenster- mehr mitbekamen.
In der Parallelstraße und in einer angrenzenden Straße fühlten wir uns nicht wirklich wohl weshalb wir diese eher mieden. Wir würden trotzdem jederzeit wieder diese Wohnung wählen weil wir uns wirklich wohl gefühlt haben."

4728410,32243021,2015-05-16,29377704,Tania,The flat was exactly as described comfortable spacious and clean. The apartment was easy to find and easy to get back to after a long day exploring Paris. The grocery store bakery cafes are all nearby and if after a long day you don't feel like eating out there are restaurants that offer takeaway options.Our family of 5 (2 adults and 3 children) fitted comfortably and we would definitely return. The host had prepared a very helpful welcome letter for us and was very flexible with checkout times. Thank you

Il est entre plusieurs métros mais assez éloigné au final. Il y a malheureusement un nid d'oiseaux juste au dessus de la chambre ce qui peut réveiller...

Pour l'organisation. 'Carolyn' propose beaucoup de logement donc il y a d'autre interlocuteurs et la communication pas top du à la traduction des messages."
24437658,294513653,2018-07-22,154934156,Jonas,Nette Gastgeber die Koommunikationsfreudig sind und gerne bei der Gestalltung von Ausflügen helfen da sie sich gut in Paris auskennen und alle Fragen beantworten können. Sehr flexibel mit Check- Inn/Out Zeiten. Die Unterkunft befindet sich in einer ruhigen und sicheren Gegend am Rande von Paris. Sehr zu empfehlen und gerne wieder!
13339029,474506360,2019-06-23,40349276,Valérie Et Famille,Chambre très calme et quartier très agréable avec le marché et le canal tout proche.
5812466,54144636,2015-11-16,4166753,Ian,"Aglaé's forethought was obvious the moment we walked in the door. Paris maps and guides of course; a diagram of the neighborhood showing the best source for fresh croissants the nearest street markets the cool cafés and friendly restaurants; but much more. Fresh supplies in the fridge and pantry. A shelf of dvd's for many different tastes. Comfortable and tasteful furnishings. Light-blocking drapes in the bedroom. And then there's the view from the living room and the balcony — rooftops and sky as far as you can see with patches of green to mark the Bois de Vincennes and the Père Lachaise cemetery.
One more instance of Aglaé's concern for her guests. We were in Paris during the recent terror attacks. There were reports that the airports were being shut down in response. Aglaé got in touch to find out how we were and to say that if events made it impossible for us to leave as planned she would make it her business to find us a place to stay. Fortunately we didn't need that help but what a comforting feeling to know it was available."
4315991,25094875,2015-01-06,22790115,Olivia,Christophe is great host warm welcome when we arrived paris. The apartment was excellent comfortable and good size for 2 couples. Excellent location 2 mins to metro cafe and grocery shops are just around the corner.
4960017,538702285,2019-09-30,23270542,Stephen,A very lovely apartment in an awesome neighborhood in Paris.  We had a wonderful stay and it was nice to be located in 'real' Paris as opposed to tourist Paris.
5725480,249898620,2018-04-03,147940226,娜,Noémie is a very kind. The apartment is very warm and close to the subway station and the supermarket. It is very convenient.
7431627,117305558,2016-12-06,17128134,Stacey,This is a great apartment in the heart of the 11th arrondissement. Close to plenty of restaurants. It was clean and cozy. Do note that the apartment is up 6 flights of stairs. The first floor is up one flight of stairs so even though the apartment is labeled as being on the 5th floor it is actually six flights up. The bathroom is also outside the apartment. But all in all we enjoyed our stay and public transportation was easily accessible. 
27425717,527091242,2019-09-10,13910323,James,It’s a great location with excellent light. Could be cleaner. Perfect for two adults with children. It’s a stretch to say four adults would be cozy. Really a great place to stay with access to transportation.

908363,351925249,2018-11-24,190782391,Michael,Looked at a number of apts to stay at in Paris. This apartment caught my eye and I went with it. The location is perfect as described in other reviews. The apt has lovely character and old Europe charm. 20 foot ceilings and doors. Old iron railing on terrace. We had a lovely stay and would stay there again in a heart beat. Thanks for all.
10226957,67685402,2016-03-30,62893907,Anna,I had a wonderful few nights at Thomas' apartment. He was away so unfortunately I didn't get to meet him but his beautiful friend Maxime was there and gave us lots of tips. There is a great market only 3 minutes away and the metro is also right there. The apartment was beautiful and exactly like that in the pictures a wonderful mix of eclectic decor. There was a full kitchen and bathroom and it was like being at home. I loved all the indoor plants and didn't want to leave! The neighbourhood is friendly and myself and my friend always felt safe. I really hope I can come back!! 
17186194,304224474,2018-08-09,25274762,Catherine,A very clean and stylish place to stay. Very central yet quite. Would definitely reccomend. 
16744299,132517156,2017-02-18,106641481,Logement,What a hidden gem the apartment is impeccable the pool nicely warmed for the cold weather the king sized bed bath tub and coffee machine make you never wanna leave this place. But that's not the best part the best is the fact the apartment is inside a kickass eclectic boutique hotel with an amazing Peruvian restaurant a hidden Mezcal bar with some of the best cocktails in town and is perfectly located in the heart of the Marais. I could talk of the amazing views from the rooftop private patio or the convenience of an amazing breakfast downstairs with bio Peruvian coffee but I rather tell you that I met a group of American fashion models during the happy hour who were excited to know I had an apartment with a pool just upstairs.

13731325,468754664,2019-06-13,232661582,Armando,The apartment is conveniently located with easy access to the metro. The apartment was clean and cozy. The one issue we had which put a huge damper on our trip was the leak in the bathroom from a water tank which caused the bathroom floor to flood. We were given inaccurate information as to when the problem would be fixed. Instead we were given a bucket to place in the bathroom and a mop in case the bucket overflowed while we were out. On the second day of our stay we were awakened by someone knocking on the door at 8 am it took a while for us to figure out he was the plumber since he didn’t speak English and we don’t speak French. The host told us she would refund one night for the inconvenience as of now we have not been refunded she has not replied to our messages and we are waiting to her back from Airbnb support.
19332200,291648743,2018-07-16,146380424,Ashley,This stay was the best I've ever had in Paris. I truly love the spacious living area and the bathroom is modern and very clean. The entire apartment was SPOTLESS & I'm very big on details It was truly amazing. The hostess was exceptional perfect! The amenities were sooooo useful. PLEASE STAY HERE! The location is perfection just be careful around the park across the street during late hours. I will return to Paris soon and plan on staying here again! I loved it! Can't say anything better!

Small kitchen if you are planning to cook but it is sufficient for us to make breakfast (we usually eat out or order take-outs). He is very friendly and responsive to messages.

1210688,484675114,2019-07-09,33251994,Alyssa,Jerome’s home was exactly what we had hoped for on our first trip to Paris together! To start he was always quick to respond to any questions we had both before and during our stay. Extremely helpful and accommodating host! The unit itself was perfect for the two of us. Down a small quiet street it had everything we needed to feel right at home and was located in a fantastic area. Very close to several affordable 4+ star restaurants and patisseries as well as an excellent grocery store 30 seconds away.  We enjoyed roaming about the 11th and sipping on beverages at the cafe at the end of the block! Jerome’s home is a MUST stay while in Paris as I am sure you will not find a better place especially for the value. I would stay here again and again and very much look forward to our next stay at Jerome’s!
8065771,200075685,2017-10-04,8503556,Soren,This is a really great place to stay. It's located close to the metro and is really convenient for getting around. Fred is really communicative and the views in the apartment are great. One warning: the Wi-Fi signal was not that great so we had to make due with our cell ones. But overall a great place to stay!

19586066,353039083,2018-11-26,83713343,Rosalie,Great place to stay at in Paris. Delphine is a very friendly host who will make you feel at home and will give you all the information you need about the area which she knows very well. The feel of the place is very unique and bohemian. I felt at ease immediately. The location is great as an ex-Parisian I discovered a new area with lots to offer. Was a real pleasure and would definitely recommend!

6816874,145835630,2017-04-20,56476685,Janet,Camille was a very lovely host. Welcoming letting me store my bags before completely checking in so I could explore without that hassle. The place is very centric and it's a 20something minute walk to Louvre. Also close to public transit so you can go anywhere else. There are a lot of stairs so it could be difficult if one has a big suitcase but it was perfect for me; a single traveler just a few days in Paris. 
6724756,140886031,2017-04-01,49358818,Joe,A wonder ful stay in Paris.  Kathleen and Erik were very kind and helpful.  Beautiful rooftop views and living at a very affordable cost.  A delight!!!

There are 2 metro stops in opposite directions and about the same walking distance. Many cute cafes and restaurants surrounding. This is a shared apartment so we stayed with Pascale in a room of her home whilst her son daughter and herself were staying there also however we had excellent privacy. 
Apartment is also 5 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. "
25708665,447250267,2019-05-03,12343012,Rosmarijn,This lovely stylish  apartment in Montmartre is perfectly located with the metro close by and many many fantastic restaurants around the corner. The apartment is small but has everything you need. The bedrooms have no doors and you have to go up quite steep (but very trendy) stairs (not suitable for elderly persons/children)  to reach the bedroom upstairs. Beds are comfortable and place is very clean. The shower is small (if you are really tall or overweight you might not fit in the shower) but works fine. Neigborhood is safe and has many restaurants shops and ofcourse the sacre-coeur. Will definitely  stay here again!

There is a separate kitchen and bathroom and the main area is quite spacious with a table couch armchair and bed. From the apartment you have a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower and city of Paris. The apartment is very close to many small shops and restaurants. The Belleville metro station is only ~100m away with the Metro 2 and 11 lines which can get you into the centre very quickly. 

Nicola was friendly and fast with communication. I definitely recommend staying at this apartment."

9725985,319050900,2018-09-05,102159664,Kendra,Nicolas' home is very accurate to the listing. His representative was waiting for us when we arrived and the directions he provided to enter the building was spot on. Nicolas' home is in the center of an ideal location. The metro is a short 1-2 minute walk around the corner there's a yummy bakery directly across the street restaurants on either end of the block and a short 15 -20 min walk to the Eiffel Tower. I was surprised to find power strips for guest to charge their items without a converter in the living and bedroom. Nicolas was very receptive to my outreach prior to the trip and during my time in his house. Overall Nicolas' house is great and I will definitely stay again when I return to Paris.

It is right next to the metro station so it’s very safe and easy to get to wherever you need to be in Paris. The room is very clean and comfortable and you have your own bathroom which was well maintained. Jojo was not around but her husband and sister in law were there and are very kind and hospitable! There are also babies in the home so if you are someone bothered by a baby crying in the middle of the night don’t stay here. All in all a fantastic stay merci beaucoup!

Mieszkanie było zgodne z opisem czyste jasne funkcjonalne - w sam raz dla pary na kilkudniowy wypad. Kamienica w której się znajdowało była schludna i klimatyczna. Spokojna ale żywa za dnia okolica - dużo kawiarenek piekarni punktów usługowych. Bardzo blisko do metra.

17623014,180043866,2017-08-09,1207343,John & Helena,Fantastic stay. Nadim communicated everything so well before arrival and it was a pleasure to meet him when we got to the apartment. The apartment was very clean and had everything you would need for a stay in Paris.  The area is very cool. Small streets full of cafes very Parisian buildings and full life without being noisy. I have no hesitation to recommend Nadim's place to stay if you are coming to Paris.
3687425,66406326,2016-03-22,17469723,Jenny,Lovely little flat ideal for a couple! It is modern and extremely clean and the bed is extremely comfortable after a day of exploring the city on foot. The location is perfect we could walk to all the main tourist sites and there were great shops and restaurants around the apartment for breakfast and in the evenings. Imane was very helpful at all times and always in contact and even though we didn’t get to meet the check in was so easy! The building work did wake us up on the week day morning (luckily we also stayed on a Sunday when the builders weren’t working) however it didn’t spoilt our stay. Overall a wonderful apartment and I would definitely return!

Merci Pascal!"

The place is small but comfortable and well organized and contained everything we needed for our week in Paris. The location is wonderful; close to many attractions like Notre Dame and the Louvre and steps away from the metro. The streets are lined with shops and cafes making it a convenient place to unwind after a day of walking through Paris. This place was perfect and I would recommend it to anyone!"
19049553,293505602,2018-07-20,1265148,Alix,"I stayed at Pierre’s apartment for 4 nights. The apartment is very spacious and welcoming for 2 adults and 2 young children. Amenities provided made our stay a breeze. We didn’t meet with Pierre personally but he was always very responsive for any questions we had during our stay. The apartment is located in a very convenient and lively neighborhood close to everything you may want to see in Paris. 
NB: the apartment is located on the 4th floor (5th floor for the US) and there is no elevator which is pretty common in Paris so pack accordingly "
24687295,498010334,2019-07-29,20054175,Dorin,The place is nice and in a good location. It could be improved but overall it's above standards.
5678736,58113933,2016-01-01,30519210,Luke,My boyfriend and I stayed at Axel's lovely studio for 2 nights and had a fantastic time exploring the city.  The location is great a very vibrant neighbourhood with lots of lovely local bakeries and shops and it's a beautiful walk along the river into the centre of Paris.  Getting to the apartment was a bit stressful as it's down a tiny alleyway and the directions Axel gave were a bit confused communication was also difficult as we didn't have internet outside of the apartment so his iMessages weren't coming through; when we did get hold of Axel he told us to pick the keys up from a local bistro and the owner then directed us to the street.  Parking was also a bit troublesome as it's very expensive on the street and in the parks luckily however we did manage to find a free space about 20 minutes away.  Other than that though as soon as we got there and settled in everything was lovely the bed had a strange material underneath the sheet which was slightly uncomfortable and noisy to sleep on; for the price though it was a fantastic stay and I would definitely recommend we would love to return another time.  Thanks Axel!
5595735,77362182,2016-05-31,32992016,Livia,My family and I had a lovely time. Lan helpfully contacted us beforehand and made arrangements that made our visit as smooth as possible. As described the flat is very central and right near the Centre Pompidou.

2047760,402661748,2019-01-19,45828121,Stephen,This location and layout is great for a group of up to 5 (we were 4). Honestly the only reason I am bringing the score down is because checkout was indicated as noon and at 1030 someone was knocking on the door to come in and began yelling at the remaining guest in French because he had not left yet. It was very unprofessional and also was just wrong based on the fact that the listing has a noon checkout time listed.  otherwise the place is great and the location / view is hard to beat.
12564212,174749026,2017-07-27,115865750,Adrienne,I stayed at Marie's apartment with my husband in one room and my friend in the other room for a conference at the Palais de Congres.  The proximity to transit made it a short ride on the Metro and allowed us to stay in the Marais which is one of my favourite areas in Paris to stay in.  Marie's apartment is lovely and well situated with all the amenities with some nice small touches (e.g. a bottle of wine a helpful guidebook).  It is quite central in the Marais and overlooks a busy area but the windows are well insulated and noise was not an (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Marie was easy and her colleague Cherline was helpful with check in and questions during the stay.  A lovely apartment that I would gladly recommend to couples or families interested in staying in that area.  I would definitely like to stay here again the next time I am in Paris.  
12059918,137415847,2017-03-15,10418070,Ti,Large clean open space with a great little balcony to spend the mornings out on.

It’s a lively neighborhood with grocery stores bakeries and cafes right outside the door.  It’s a quick walk to the  Republique Metro stop which is a major connection point.  It was easy to get around.
Washer dryer dishwasher water and ice in the fridge door and a microwave were all welcome and unexpectedly luxurious amenities.  The beds were very comfortable.  
Michael was a gracious and responsive host answering all our questions promptly.  We would definitely stay here again."

8641459,539865342,2019-10-02,148461392,Adam,I had an excellent time staying with Alexandra. Excellent location only about 20-30 mins by metro to the Louvre/Notre Dame with several nice bars and restaurants nearby. I did not spend much time in the apartment as I was out exploring the city but the space was very clean and well-decorated with a very comfortable bed to boot. Great spot for a solo traveler like me.
348037,238847637,2018-02-27,10467780,Mariska,Three of my friends and I had a lovely long weekend at Jason’s apt. The location is very charming with lots of great restaurants and bars within a 5 minute walk. The apt was charming and clean. I highly recommend!

The check in process was all very smooth and she allowed us to check out late as we had an early evening Eurostar home.  All in all a great stay - we only wish we'd had more time here.  Oh - and there is a great micro brewery up the road - called Brasserie la Goutte d'or.

房东Anne是位特别热情友善的房东交通出行方面给了我很多很有用的建议非常非常感谢她｡我也特别开心预定了她家的房源让我的巴黎之行变得十分的完美｡Anne的英文很好所以如果你不会法语的话用英文和她交流是完全不会有问题的｡
强烈推荐她家的房源给我国的小伙伴们无论你是一个人自由行也好还是夏季打折季前往巴黎采购也好这个地理位置都是绝佳的因为距离百货公司很近前往其他景点也十分便利巴士､地铁､RER B都有要前往各个著名景点都特别的方便快捷｡"

The location is perfect. While you are central to most everything this is a quiet street so you don’t feel so crowded. 

The appliances were top notch. We cooked in several days and had everything we needed for breakfast and dinner. The bed is comfortable and there is a ton of storage space. 

The Rue Grange has everything you need for groceries/wine/baked goods/produce and Notre Dame is steps away. 

Aurelian was a great host. His tips for the apartment and the neighborhood were very helpful in getting us settled. 

And it has a great bathtub!"

On a plaisir à s'y reposer entre deux visites de musées ou longues balades dans Paris. Très central à 5 minutes à pied des Halles et de toutes les lignes de métro donc parfait pour sillonner Paris. En séjour avec trois enfants dont deux ados on a passé 4 jours fantastiques. A notre prochain passage à Paris nous serions ravis d'y retourner c'est le plus agréable appartement que nous ayons loué à prix équivalent et l'accueil le plus personnalisé et chaleureux que nous ayons reçu. Merci à Jean-Marc et à Pierre qui s'est chargé de notre accueil et de notre confort en son absence.

The location in the heart of Montmartre was exactly what my family of four adults was looking for. Yes there are a lot of hills and stairs but there is a lift in the building for those who can’t face six flights of stairs! I’ve already recommended this apartment to my (Website hidden by Airbnb) was absolutely perfect for us. Also I don’t think the photos on Airbnb accurately reflect how spacious it is. Wonderful!

She was great at communicating and I felt safe and confident getting to her apartment and about arriving after a long flight. The apartment was just as pictured—bright comfortable and with its stunning view! It was really added so much to my stay to wake up to that view. I loved every minute of it. The location was great and I loved that there was a washer and an elevator. These things make traveling so much easier and more comfortable. Thanks again Francesca!

In the apartment there is a room with 2 separate beds a separated area with a (smaller) double bed. Also there are 2 bathrooms and 1 toilette. The area where the apartment is located is really great. Close to the metro Sacre Coeur restaurants little shops. It was the perfect location for our trip."

Questo piccolo gioiellino a Parigi merita davvero 5 stelle su tutti i punti: accogliente intimo e riservato  è perfetto per le coppie.
Io e il mio ragazzo Lorenzo siamo stati davvero benissimo: divano letto comodissimo pulizia ineccepibile e cucina ben equipaggiata doccia grande e bellissima.
Gli spazi sono ridotti ma Anne Laure lo specifica nella descrizione e inoltre dopo una serata ci si abitua tranquillamente a gestirli ed è proprio la caratteristica dell'appartamento.
Anne Laure e suo marito sono stati efficentissimi e gentilissimi: non appena abbiamo avuto un problema si sono precipitati subito per aiutarci.
Ci tornerei 1000 volte!! 
Grazie per aver contribuito a rendere il nostro soggiorno a Parigi ancora più piacevole e romantico! :)"

Candice was very responsive and so helpful and gave us so many good tips to take the most out of our stay. The bakery and 2 grocery-stores are very near also Metro stations are not far from the home. So if you are not so much into walking then the metro is a good choice to get to the center. 
It would be nice to have an extra blanket to use and to have a small carpet for the wc as the floor is cold in wc. 
But would def. stay there again as overall we loved to stay at Candice’s place! :)"

11203901,88258918,2016-07-23,53179739,Suzette,Sara was a great hostess.  She was very accommodating with our schedule.  Her apartment was very clean and comfortable and in a great location.  Very close to the metro and a convenience store.  It is the perfect place in Paris for a couple or small group.  Thank you so much for such a great experience!
56662,328077922,2018-09-25,190853458,Victor,"Beautiful view of the  Eiffel and its vicinity indeed as Sophie described it. The apartment is only a short drive from Gare du Nord. So it won't cost much by taxi to get there by train. There are bus stops by the main entrance of the building so again getting around by public transport is convenient.

Sophie has an exquisite taste for art so it has been a pleasure sitting amongst her collections just looking.

Our lady host was very generous to provide her guests with lots of local information which was extremely helpful as I don't quite speak French and asking for direction was a bit of a challenge.

The apartment was trully a home away from home. My parents whom I planned the trip specially for absolutely adored the lovely place that Sophie offered. Hope to return someday!"
4614212,230506630,2018-01-28,74561636,Oliver,The place was good but a bit small/cluttered. The neighbors were sometimes really loud and the studio smelt of smoke which was a bit annoying. Otherwise a good place to stay in Paris everything is easily accessible.
8932010,245230084,2018-03-21,42503245,Mark,"I spent 5 nights there in March.  There were some good things and some bad so I will list them both below.  I was a little disappointed overall but aside from the lack of hot water in the evening (cold showers before dinner) there was not anything overly wrong with the place it just didn't suit me.  I wanted to book an airbnb to get the feel of ""living"" in paris as best I could.  However this unit is a short term rental and managed by a company and has been renovated as such.  Nobody lives there and it's obvious that it's not what it's intended for because although things are new and finished nicely (why my girlfriend chose it) nothing is really thought out.  To me it kind of lacked character but I should have asked a few more questions about the unit so I'm mostly to blame for that.  I personally wouldn't stay there again but if you go in knowing what to expect then you may have a different experience.

Good:
The location is great cool cafes/bars/bakeries/restaurants nearby.

Metro was fairly close.

Recently renovated and most everything (bed fridge etc...) is nice/new. 

Bad:
No hot water in the evening/night.  This was the major complaint I had Nazeem  tried to sort it out over text but it didn't work.  I believe he was going to get an electrician to look so perhaps this will be sorted for the next people.

There is no closet no coat hooks nowhere in the shower to put soaps/shampoo etc..  

Although there are chairs there is no table (not a functional one as the one provide is only a few inches high)"

Julien was easy to reach even before our arrival to provide us the keys before the checking time to leave our luggage. The room is separated from the rest of the flat so we have privacy.

Tons of options for food as well as shopping and esay walk to buses and metro.  The appt is well stocked  with everything you need to stay in and cook if you wish and it comfortably sleeps 4 and even 5 if you use the pullout coach.
5148337,303762214,2018-08-08,43019385,Nicholas,"The Flat is  centrally located with easy access to the centre of town. It is on 2 floors. The kitchen / living room is on the lower floor and the bedrooms are on the second floor. The room is comfortable and clean. There is separate bathroom/WC (not ensuite). The hosts are polite and accommodating. 
The only drawback is that the building is on a busy street and therefore if the window is open there is a lot of noise. With the window closed the room can get very hot on a summer’s day (even though there is a portable fan). "

L'appartamento è a due passi dalla fermata della linea 12  Abesses e nella zona più carina di Montmartre  il supermercato Carrefur è vicino. L'unico difetto dell'appartamento è che è fronte strada e non è consigliabile aprire le finestre risulta per questo molto rumoroso anche di notte.
certamente consigliamo di scegliere questo piccolo appartamento per trascorrere brevi soggiorni a Parigi

5601114,485680283,2019-07-11,104396931,Noelle,Wonderful warm hosts and superb breakfasts in a sunlit room - what more could you ask for? Xavier and Alicia are very kind and gracious gave us great suggestions for local restaurants to try and helped us navigate the Paris metro system. We had a lovely time and would definitely recommend their beautiful home (and the location in St. Germain de Pres can't be beat - it's really central to all the major sites). Hope to come back again some day!

28845689,426506321,2019-03-21,39408201,Ken,"Dorothee's place was absolutely wonderful! One of the best places I've ever had the pleasure to stay in during my five years on Airbnb. Fabulously chic centrally located and definitely larger than most in Paris. Even better than that were her soft touches. 

She responded to us quickly accommodated our delay due to the traffic and coordinated a late check in for us despite the last minute notice. Even though she wasn't able to personally greet us we were welcomed with awesome snacks and a bottle of wine alongside fresh bottles of beer and plenty of tea and coffee to choose from. Her instructions and recommendations were superb and there were plenty of books to read and discover more on French culture and the city of Paris. One of our favourites was ""How to be Parisian wherever you are"". =) worth reading for anyone interested in witty humour and a real good time. 

For checkout her boyfriend Jules who oversaw things was just as lovely if not even more so. So genuine and so so nice he patiently waited for us to finish packing while he checked through the place helped us carry our bags down the stairs (which is really not difficult to climb at all) and even requested a taxi for us when we asked about how best to get to the airport. What's even more heartwarming was that he was willing to pay for our taxi charges when we discovered that he had to pay for the taxi upfront upon booking on the app. Insisting to pay him back he mistakenly under charged us and did not even request for the balance. Truly a gent in all senses of the word. 

For a true contemporary parisian experience at an authentic French abode with real owners who genuinely care about you and the presentation of their home look no further and just book her place if you find it available! I guarantee you will not regret it."
21777431,256004616,2018-04-22,139783846,Grzegorz,I can recommend Alexane's apartment without any hesitation. First of all it is located in a peaceful area yet only a stone's throw to a street with a range of shops (fromageries groceries etc.) and to a small square hosting one of those unbeaten Parisian brasseries teeming with visitors from the early morning to late at night. Two metro stations are also at a short distance. The apartment itself is just the way it's been presented in the photo: tiny yet not cramped well-arranged with everything right at hand and including a super-comfy bed on a mezzanine. It's perfectly suited for single travellers or couples plus bearing in mind that Paris offers you so many attractions you won't probably be spending too much time at home. Beware of the ladder leading you to the mezzanine - it requires some agility to get there:) Finally Alexane is an excellent hostess who had arranged everything beforehand and kept us informed even though she was on the other side of the globe at the time of our visit. No problems with communication clear rules laid down in advance via email and some necessary tips for survival in Paris made our stay at Alexane's apartment uneventful owing to which we could experience some truly wonderful time in this city of all cities.
11203736,245710602,2018-03-23,41094602,Nadine,"Very good location and host very reponsive. 
But some parts of the appartment should be better cleaned from one guest to the other to make sure that stains are removed form the floor (ex in the small kitchen).
Small room very noisy from neighbours’ tv and street.  main room is quite."

Le logement semble propre lumineux et spacieux. En réalité l’appartement est très encombré et sale. La douche est remplie de moisissures. Les draps sont sales et le clic clac est dans un état lamentable.
Nous avons fui cet appartement pendant notre séjour parisien nous avons tout fait pour y rester le moins possible car nous n’y étions vraiment pas bien.
Il est vétuste et sale."

1777138,28876849,2015-03-31,27532665,Anna,Appartamentino stupendo con una vista magnifica. Non manca niente: è confortevole luminoso arredato con gusto e semplicità. La vicinanza alla metro la sua location centralissima lo rendono uno dei posticini da annotare e da riprenotare in futuro. L'accoglienza di Marie è perfetta. Non si potrebbe chiedere di più. Mille volte grazie.
8097866,66887868,2016-03-25,5702558,Maria,Хозяин был очень гостеприимен. Несмотря на то что он не говорил по-английски а мы - по-французски мы смогли с ним объясниться он показал нам квартиру в которой было все необходимое. Квартира расположена очень близко к метро. На метро до Трокадеро минут 15 с одной пересадкой. Мы остались довольны всем рекомендуем останавливаться у Алена. Квартира полностью соответсвует фотографиям размещенным на сайте.

14442028,286045863,2018-07-05,174197150,Oliver,We had a very nice time in Paris staying at Romans place everything is exactly how described. Friendly housemate clean and private room and a clean shared bathroom. Right next to train station so you can get around Paris easily. The area is pretty dodgy at night around the station though
21388026,459309143,2019-05-27,197478023,Yuriy,"My wife and I stayed at Oliver’s place for 4 days and had a great time. The apartment was clean and the location is great. A metro station is right across the street and there are many great restaurants and bakeries in the neighborhood. We loved our stay! Also the Sacré-Cœur Basilica -  a popular tourist destination - is within walking distance.

FYI: The bathroom (especially the shower cabin) is relatively small but that is very characteristic of the appartments in Paris."

Mais petite surprise en arrivant il y a bien une télévision mais sans câble donc impossible d'avoir la télé ! Mon hôte m'a indiqué qu'il allait faire le nécessaire mais ensuite plus aucun signe de vie malgré les relances. Et puis pas de papier toilette en arrivant... Et attention il n'y a pas de wifi ! Bref des détails qui n'ont pas rendu le séjour hyper agréable. Vraiment dommage.

5917003,57520381,2015-12-27,42246015,R J,"This was our first time to use Airbnb and our stay in Jason's 2-bedroom apartment became a part of our family's first Christmas in Paris. Jason promptly replied to our inquiries. His emails & airbnb reviews conveyed his trustworthiness. 
The apartment was about 50 minutes by Uber from CDG during the Monday rush. There were multiple doorways with security codes and an elevator to his floor. Jason met us upon our arrival and gave us a quick tour and went through his very comprehensive welcome guide. I appreciated the fact that his guide also included detailed instructions on how to operate the washer-dryer combo TV and sound system remotes. 
He had complimentary snacks wine juice eggs and bread. He had a couple of poinsettias on display to add a touch of Christmas to his place. The apartment was as described and was surprisingly quiet despite being surrounded by restaurants and cafes. We found it convenient that there was a wide variety of international cuisine on the same street and around the block and a grocery a few steps away from his apartment building. His kitchen was stocked with cooking essentials so it was a big plus for our family to start our days with a hot breakfast. We've stayed in two-bedroom hotel suites with kitchenettes and a common living area but this time having a washer-dryer combo en suite was very convenient.
Jason also helped us locate a nearby provider of travel wi-fi which was a big plus for us. He answered all our inquiries about visiting Paris.
The apartment's location was perfect. We walked to the Notre Dame cathedral the tourist center and the Louvre.
Despite our early morning departure Jason was there for our checkout and that was seamless as well. 
Overall we were very satisfied with our first experience with Airbnb and we know it was because Jason was the perfect host."

Daniele offered generous advice maps and notes and we enjoyed her company during check in. Daniele’s location was ideal for the activities we had planned. The apartment offered plenty of space was clean and tidy had everything we needed and had a great view of the city. We enjoyed our morning coffee at Cafe Dunois and the grocery store was just around the corner. But most of all Daniele’s hospitality and good nature were most memorable about our stay. Merci Daniele.

4963795,42662881,2015-08-15,30837125,Alex,I stayed in this apartment for two months and had a wonderful time. It is in a perfect location for sightseeing and is well-stocked with everything you would need for a short or longer stay. Several grocery stores nice restaurants and bars are right in the area. Nearby Metro stop and velib bikes make getting around the city extremely easy. Yves was an attentive responsive and gracious host. 
13797199,435658748,2019-04-11,19162019,Annie,Although small the accommodation was very well-planned out  with an amazing bed great shower and kitchen. We felt very safe and the location is surprisingly quiet especially at night. There are plenty of friendly places to eat and drink plus a couple of supermarkets nearby. Louis-Marc speaks fluent English and was friendly and helpful. We found the location really useful and we’d definitely use this accommodation again. Thanks for letting us rent your place!
26741465,310199775,2018-08-19,1941760,Lara,"Serge’s apartment is even better than expected from the photos it has amazing natural light you can open up all the doors and being opposite the park is just delightful.  The view is green and lush.  
Location was perfect.
Loved his decor the place is quirky and was perfect for us (2 friends) for a weekend but if you’re hoping for luxury the double bed is small and the sofa bed is a single one.  
The bathroom is basic too.
All reflected in the very fair price though!
Serge was also super accommodating and quick to respond to all messages on arrival and allowed us to check out late  on the Sunday 
I would absolutely recommend staying there.

4269775,45933081,2015-09-07,34219811,Shelbi,Gwen was an awesome host. Was available when we had questions or concerns. The flat was cute and tiny. I second other reviews about bed from ceiling distance. I hit my head a few times but for what you pay and the location I highly recommend. Also no bathroom privacy .... Which was fine for me and my friend we are close but if you're bringing a new lover to Paris be warned most of the little flats don't have privacy. Great experience with this place! 
2331688,164940045,2017-06-29,129746182,Melissa,This suite is perfect for a stay in Paris. It is located in the heart of Montmartre around the corner from the famous Au Lapin Agile. The view is beautiful and the suite is large enough for two people to stay in comfortably. My husband and I were visiting Paris for the first time and we absolutely loved staying here for the week. The suite is very clean the bed is comfortable and there is a nice cross breeze from the two large windows. Keep in mind there is no lift and seven flights of stairs so try to pack light. But the climb is well worth the view of the city! We hope to stay here again in the future.

19045491,228125321,2018-01-18,103941798,Olivia,100% recommend this lovely and cosy apartment. As long as you can handle the stairs and moving your suitcases up and down (which can be a struggle) the incredible view and comfortable clean apartment are worth the climb. Ludovic is very hospitable and makes you feel at home right away easy to contact and we never felt uneasy while there.

13499154,268914214,2018-05-26,175277975,Erica,My husband and I had a nice time staying in Fiona’s apartment. At first we were a little confused if we were in the right place because the pictures aren’t up to date but it was a minor issue. (Some things are just arranged differently and  have a little more ware then when the photos were taken but again very minor issue) Fiona had a thourough check in and made it quite easy to get settled. She had all the ammenties to cook meals for ourselves (little market right down the street also)  I would suggest bringing a wine opener if your like us and wanted a glass of wine with dinner. We werent able to find one but could have just missed it. She had great suggestions for food and drinks also. I was a fan of how the toilet and the shower were in two different rooms so my husband and I could get ready without running into each other. The elevator was the cutest thing ever and so enjoyed using it! (I’m very petite so folks bigger then I am might not have as much fun because you do have to stand sideways to fit.) It was in a really good area and we felt like we were close to everything and very safe!  It was a very nice experience!
7709877,227169249,2018-01-14,6002288,Dmitri,"Agnes' place is exactly as she describes. Agnes is a delightful warm host. Her place is clean and cozy. Hundreds of neatly stacked books line the shelves that hug her spiral staircase--a bibliophile's dream.
The building she lives in is quite special too. I was taken by it as I approached and was so pleased when I realized that was where I would be staying. It is The City of Eiders by architect Mario Heymann if you are curious. 
She is very close to the 7 line of the Metro so getting anywhere in Paris from hers is easy. 
If it was available next time I was in Paris I wouldn't hesitate to book it again."

She was prompt (actually arrived before us) and extremely friendly and was willing to help with any issues about travel or where to go in Paris. She has a fantastic apartment that is clean and accommodating. I never needed to contact her during our 8 night stay but I knew that Rina would answer the phone at the drop of a hat if need be. Very thankful and will definitely be staying back here in the future. 
The apartment itself is amazing. It's small but a short stay will be fine. Im a large guy 6 foot 4 and 100+kg but I was able to sleep in the upstairs bed just fine and the room is very warm. The location is the real sweet spot with the exit for the St Placide Metro stop literally 6 steps from the front door. Great cafes nearby in the superb St Germain area.

Highly recommend. "
28355084,429893659,2019-03-29,79397536,Christiana,Staying at Jacques’s was one of the best decisions I made in planning our trip to Paris. The location - quite literally at the foot of Sacré-Coeur - was outstanding and allowed for a really unique visit. You really are staying in authentic Paris at this place. The flat itself was very lovely & modern - perfect for pairs or even a small group as there’s a pull out couch. Entry was very safe even though it’s on a busy street and there are many fabulous restaurants right nearby. One small thing to keep in mind is that there’s no laundry facilities at this flat. However I highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a less touristy place to stay while in Paris.

3180419,52306729,2015-10-28,28178702,Stephanie,This apartment was lovely very nicely decorated. The host was a lovely lady who kept in contact the whole time n met me with a little note which was very cute. The apartment was in a great location easy links to the tube one tube from the Gare du Nord too. Close to markets bars and cafes. The only issue I would mention for some people would be 4 flights of very old steps I think it added to the cuteness of the apartment but some people would struggle with the amount of steps. This was my first air bnb experience and I really enjoyed it. Thanks

It is very cosy- typical french- and everything was clean. even though the kitchen is not very big we had everything we needed and- oh my god- THE VIEW!!! Unbelievable. You can sit there at the table all day and just watch :) The grocery- store in the building is very practical and there are just a few steps to Sacre Coeur and the Moulin de la Galette. 
I really hope to come back one day!!!"

27134966,319466018,2018-09-06,197066486,Adam,I could not recommend Vakils apartment enough for stay in Paris. It was clean modern and stylish with everything a guest could need and more! It is situated near two metro stops both 5/10 minutes away from the apartment which made it very easy to get to tourist spots in 20/25 minutes. Vakil was a superb host who was very helpful easy to communicate quickly with and made us feel very comfortable during our stay.

She is a super nice lady and has welcomed me very warmly in her apartment and even showed me the area around by a quick walk. The apartment is super sweet and cozy in the heart of Paris. Samra has set up the apartment with an eye to the detail with the perfect useful equipment and essentials. I would anytime try to get this place again when I go to Paris m. I truly recommend it! :) 
Kind regards XX"
2441971,177224279,2017-08-02,131226128,David,Great location just a block from the metro and very homey comfortable place.  The complex has a very high level of security and an adequate fitness center.
29198887,494858695,2019-07-25,271696423,Joanne,If you're looking to experience a bit of Paris that is off the typical tourist path this neighborhood is wonderful.  There are amazing highly ranked restaurants within the area including a really small and wonderful place called Mokonuts just around the corner.  It is walkable to the Oberkampf area which is super fun and dynamic to just visit.  Two different metro lines are very closeby and using the metro gets you all over the rest of Paris very easily.  We found the bus lines from in front of the flat easy to navigate and being able to come back to a spacious place after a long day out was wonderful respite.  Especially key during the hot summer was air conditioning and the ability to do laundry in the flat itself.  Stanley provided great instructions for how to get in and out of the flat and we navigated all of it with no problem.  Several other reviewers have commented on the narrowness of the stairs leading up to the bedrooms above and with a large suitcase it was a little bit tricky but having the bedrooms above both with an ensuite is worth it for separating from different people in your group at the end of the day.  Thanks Stanley!
462863,14213306,2014-06-14,9984769,Jérôme,Merci pour ton accueil et ta sympathie. C'est un plaisir de revenir à chaque fois. A très bientôt.
23068980,420919997,2019-03-08,27788639,Angela,Location is perfect! It’s a small but cozy space which has everything you really need. If traveling with a little one it is a bit tight but manageable. The stairs can be daunting after a long day of walking but not bad. Perfect spot for a couple traveling.
10086573,70426661,2016-04-17,57141034,Daniele,"Appartamento nuovo e ben rifinito accogliente e pulito. Vicino a Metro e supermarket. Piano terra camere prive di finestre e strette. Una delle due è priva di armadio e appoggi.
Manca il servizio cortesia in bagno e parecchi oggetti utili in cucina come: coltello per il pane tegame grande tagliere asciugapiatti scolapiatti ciotola per verdure olio sale forbici (l'appartamento è venduto per 6 ospiti).
Manca anche un attaccapanni.
Grande difficoltà a contattare l'host fino al giorno precedente ho dovuto chiamare airbnb per sollecitare le informazioni di accesso. L'host ha provveduto inviando un messaggio (Hidden by Airbnb) . Non lo abbiamo mai incontrato e lui non si è mai fatto sentire durante tutta la nostra permanenza e nemmeno il giorno della nostra partenza.
Consigliato per soggiorni brevi soprattutto se si è in più di 3-4 persone."
23519132,470298445,2019-06-16,57397540,Lene,"This is not prestigious it’ just OK. 
Location is fine the rental is overall clean with a cosy quiet bedroom and spacious light rooms but it is lacking care and soul. 
Expect stains from previous water damage on the walls and ceiling in the living room and kitchen missing or broken lamps sofa with stained cushions. 
Staff is friendly but it does not compensate the lack of transparency the company management choses to have regarding the state of the appartement. This rental is not worth the rate that they are asking."

Les descriptions des logements sont identiques à la réalité et Romy vous fait sentir les bienvenus et les comprend. Absolument dans d’autres possibilités de voyage à Paris cette option d’hébergement sera la première de mes choix.  
J'ai tout simplement tout aimé: l'emplacement l'ambiance la propreté et surtout l'hôte charmant.  

Je suis vraiment satisfait de tout ce que Romy offre aux invités donc je recommande vivement de réserver cet endroit.  L'entrée est individuelle et a tous les équipements dans la chambre y compris la salle de bain.  C'était juste parfait!  

Remarque: faites attention aux sacs trop lourds car il y a des escaliers."
11923031,70179137,2016-04-16,2305421,Martial,Un appartement très propre bien agencé décoré avec goût et idéalement situé dans le 15ème arrondissement. Il est de surcroît super-équipé et vous ne manquerez absolument de rien tant sur le confort que sur la cuisine ou le multimédia. Cyrille et son amie ont été remarquables concernant la qualité de leur accueil et le contact au cours du séjour. Pour tous ces points je leur mets un gros 10/10 et je reviendrai avec grand plaisir !!!

Only negative is the floor bracket in the entrance to the bathroom. It's come loose and repeatedly falls off it's perch. Be careful. Could easily cut a foot. "

Note that stairs down to bedroom are very steep so would not recommend for people with balance issues was no problem for us.  Good shower small but workable kitchen wonderful outside patio for morning coffee afternoon wine!  Thanks Franz!
22077196,230813315,2018-01-29,134880792,Salvatore,"La stanzetta andava più che bene peccato che fosse ubicata in una mansarda e per arrivarci abbiamo fatto un po' di fatica nonostante io sia magro in quanto per raggiungerla bisogna salire su una scala da muratore a 4 mani e passare da uno spazio abbastanza stretto. Il bagno piccolino tutto sommato poteva andare bene ma non era pulitissimo.
Nonostante tutto la consiglio e ci ritornerei perché Nils è stato gentilissimo una persona veramente squisita e disponibile. Grazie di tutto !"

34582268,496312451,2019-07-27,38039225,Sarah,This place was not air conditioned and we were there during a 107°F heat wave! The shower did not drain well. The location is fantastic!!! We loved getting to know the bakery just 2 doors down and the pizza place 1 block away was also amazing. The place was pretty quiet and located close enough to a home store that we got fans to beat the heat.
926587,47454400,2015-09-19,8266730,Janice,We loved our time in Brune's apartment. The location was ideal - easy to get to all we wanted to see in Paris without being super-touristy. The Marais is great. We used the Velib bike rental station across the street a few times. Easy to use Metro and bus too. The apartment was spacious and well equipped. The bedrooms are situated away from the busy street. I could hear the upstairs neighbors a bit (I am a light sleeper) but I think that is just apartment living. Be ready with the 500 euro (or dollars are ok) deposit. Some basic food items were available - coffee tea oil vinegar.  Wifi worked fine. It was nice to have a washer and dryer. All in all it was a terrific place. I would go back. 
232293,19777423,2014-09-18,19268666,Franziska,Wir haben drei Nächte in Fabrices Apartment übernachtet und waren rundum zufrieden. Zwar gab es anfangs leichte Kommunikationsschwierigkeiten sobald ich Kontakt per Handy aufnahm bekam ich jedoch sofort eine Antwort und die Nummer von Anne-Marie Fabrices Tante die sich vor Ort um das Apartment kümmert. Sie empfing uns sehr freundlich zeigte uns das Apartment ganz genau hatte viele hilfreiche Tips zu öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln Sehenswürdigkeiten Restaurants usw. Das Apartment befindet sich in einem sehr hübschen und sicheren Stadtviertel und die Metro ist direkt vor der Tür. Das Haus ist ein wunderschöner Altbau und das Apartment klein aber gepflegt mir einer tollen Aussicht über die Dächer von Paris. Alles in Allem ist die Wohnung absolut zu empfehlen. Vielen Dank für die Gastfreundschaft!

Arnaud is a great host he wants to make sure that we have everything we need.

The location is great super close to the Metro and also close to supermarket and some nice diner.

Thank you Arnaud for making our stay comfortable! Anyone who goes to Paris and want experience something artsy and hip should stay at Arnaud. "

18133631,246428131,2018-03-25,65261803,Lisa,Francis was a wonderful host.  He sat down with us and reviewed a map of the city to ensure we had our bearings.  He also let us know about the open-air market at the bottom of the street (FABULOUS!!!) and made some great restaurant recommendation.  The location is second to none!!! It is close to Notre Dame and Saint Chapelle plus there are loads of wonderful shops and restaurants just down the street -- including a boulangerie charcuterie fromagerie and fruit/vegetable shop.  The apartment is roomy and comfortable and clean which made it a great space to come to at the end of a long day of exploring Paris!  :-)

4215853,22280943,2014-11-02,20428668,Owen,Geoffroy was great to deal with from the start. He answered all my questions very quickly. I asked about his lack of reviews but he assured me that he had not rented out his apartment before. I was over watching rugby at stade jean-bouin (stade francais) with my dad and the location couldn't have been better. It would also be excellent for le parc des princes (Paris St Germain) and Roland Garros. The apartment itself was spacious stylish and was even better than in the photos. The views from the balcony are great and it was nice to spend some time outside on maybe the last hot day of the year. The apartment was extremely tidy and too easy to spend time there! The concierge / porter was on hand to give us the key so I could arrange a time to arrive that suited me. Really easy to arrange all round. I'm happy to give his first review and I couldn't  recommend more.

It is light-filled and beautifully designed in a bustling and trendy neighborhood. Walking distance to tons of great restaurants and shops (we ran out of time before we could even eat at all the places on our list!) - definitely look forward to returning in the future!
343648,79178349,2016-06-11,32993654,Beth,Leading up to the trip Virginie was incredibly helpful and easy to reach. She was out of town when we arrived so she could not meet us. She sent her friend in her place and made sure we had all of the contact information needed. Her friend was very welcoming very easy to reach and incredibly helpful during our entire stay in Paris. The room was exactly as it looks in pictures and was in a wonderful location. We would definitely stay here again!

4028574,91193055,2016-08-04,66606211,Richard,We had a wonderful stay in Clara's apartment.   The flat is very cosy but our family of two adults and two teenagers managed quite well and the kitchen had all the amenities we needed.   The apartment sits at the end of a lovely passageway far from the street so it's very quiet.  The location cannot be topped in a neighborhood full of interesting restaurants shops and sites.  We especially enjoyed the small food market just a two minute walk from the flat which was immensely helpful whenever we needed to buy something on the spur of the moment.  We would definitely recommend Clara's flat to anyone visiting Paris.
3529923,28001822,2015-03-16,26520449,Kristina,My friends and I stayed in this apartment for two night. It was extremely clean and exactly like the pictures provided. Charles was helpful and flexible with check in/out times! We had a wonderful stay in Paris!

There was window  blind missing and not fixed for our stay which was inconvenient given the heat at that time in Paris and that we were using the lounge as a second bedroom.

29608173,496991095,2019-07-28,90072283,Tulasi,We had a great stay at the apartment. We loved the location and the space was good. It would be nice to have directions for the stove dishwasher and washer/dryer in English. Also a guide book in the apartment would be nice to know about some of the sights and also the highlights of the Rue Cler neighborhood.

Yes there does appear to be a delay in your responses. We enjoyed your apartment and left keys on counter at 11:30. Didn’t get your response until 2:28. We think you have done a wonderful job decorating and using all of the space. Your location is superb!  

Some suggestions for improvements you should consider:

1. Provide a cork screw. This is Paris after all. 
2. Provide some more drinking glasses. 
3. Provide instructions regarding usage of tv. 
4. Replace towels. They are showing signs of wear and have distinct smell about them. 

We have travelled to many Air BNBs in US and Europe and own two apartments on Maui Hawaii which we rent to visitors on both these platforms so we have some basis for our comments. 

Thanks. 
Allan"

9590138,212305044,2017-11-17,33563205,Christophe,Un appartement très bien décoré accessible à proximité des transports en commun et à deux pas des Champs Elysées. La vue est très dégagée du fait d’être au 7eme étage (avec ascenseur). Je recommande vivement !

L’appartement est très bien situé (5m de plusieurs stations de métros) très propre et lumineux. Parfait pour quelques jours à deux dans Paris!"
14147642,182771388,2017-08-15,133544855,Julia,Anna's apartment was wonderfully calm and can easily be reached via métro. It was nice to have a place to rest after a long day of walking through Paris. Her introduction was very friendly and communication worked perfectly.
26433091,338384530,2018-10-19,22411322,Ieva,It's a very cozy apartment. The location was amazing!!! :)))
28516108,438318044,2019-04-16,194973345,Luba,The place was easy to assess  the host write email with clear information how to get inside the building and the apartment.  Please is clean but anyway you don't spend a lot of time inside of apartment. I choose this place because it's really nice view to the Seine River and on the side of the window you're really can see Eiffel Tower . Will recommend this place.
770556,49967157,2015-10-08,11763974,Ruth,Deborah was very easy to work with. Always answered my questions. She was kind enough to arrange transfers for us from the airport and then again to the train station. We arrived early so she let us store our bags in her garage. She lives in the complex so it's very easy. Be prepared to haul your bags up some stairs to the complex and a little ways to the apartment. There are two bedrooms on the main floor one in the basement and one upstairs so if you are in one of the last two bedrooms you will be lugging your bags up and down some stairs. Not an issue for us but it may be for some. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable and in a nice quiet neighborhood. The complex is very safe and secure. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend staying at Deborah's apartment.
6793931,48004652,2015-09-22,17077004,Cosima,The flat is located in a wonderful lovely neighbourhood everything you need (restaurants bakeries métro stops supermarket etc.) is nearby. The flat is small and very cosy well equipped and very clean. Even if we didn't met Candice she was a good host responded always immediately and was very friendly and helpful with lots of good advises. We would come back there and can recommend the place!
1055372,19665517,2014-09-16,12846181,Kim,We were greeted by Roxana who helped us get aquainted with the apartment and all of its features.  She was very sweet and helpful to us.

Response for the queries from the owner is good but reachable only via text. During emergency impossible to call them over phone even if we do so maintenance person is not much aware of the house details."

5047163,471780547,2019-06-18,41103447,Slava,"Sorry but I can not recommend this place. Wish I could leave a positive review but it was not a pleasant stay. First thing you will notice is a putrid smell of mold or sewer which is covered by a constant spray of glade resulting in a disgusting overall smell. The place is MUCH smaller than in pictures. Entry is through a busy street next to an Asian restaurant. There is a constant noise thorough the night due to people partying. Internet only worked one day and on one device. 

Only positive is the proximity to city center and all the landmarks."
6252911,219830124,2017-12-19,10352618,Svetlana,"Небольшая студия со всем необходимым. Откидная кровать трансформирующаяся в диван- удобная.
Кухня со всеми приборами.
Самый центр Парижа 7 район из окна вид на башню.Вокруг есть все абсолютно- и магазины и кафе и башня и метро.
4 этаж лифт есть. Маленький балкончик со столиком летом наверное будет еще лучше."
4341185,302857042,2018-08-06,59437624,Matt,"Fantastic location. Also extremely quiet and spacious. As a regular visitor to Paris I will definitely stay there again.

The apartment was comfortable spacious and clean.  The bedroom was big enough for a crib (since we travelled with our baby) with room to spare.  The kitchen had all facilities to cook.

Julien-Pierre was very welcoming and communication before and during our stay was very easy.

I would recommend this apartment to my friends visiting Paris.

Merci Julien-Pierre."

It is nice and cozy (even for a cold November night) has all the amenities that you really need and it was close by different metro stations and mini-markets. Also Julien was extremely helpful and nice regarding all out different questions or requests.

7297223,292182990,2018-07-17,15001089,Mio,A gem hidden on a private street in Paris. It's the perfect place if you want a special experience for a Paris visit. The apartment is clean and stylish well equipped and the terrace makes it even more special. It located in a quite and private area close to the Butte Chaumont parc and the cool upcoming area in Belleville. Albane was a great host and stayed connected to see if we had any needs or advice. Looking forward to coming back soon!
19154824,507900056,2019-08-12,3554616,Seth,Harout was a great host.  Having a FULLY stocked fridge was a great surprise and an extra special touch.  This apartment had everything.  There is a lot of furniture in the apartment so it is a little tight with little ones and all their stuff.  You'll need to find your inner a Marie Kondo and stay organized! The apartment is a great location with easy access to great restaurants and the metro.
746611,340530388,2018-10-24,23302165,Hele,Worth its title--charming apartment! Great location in a very nice (and rather expensive) neighbourhood.
1038815,102170849,2016-09-17,82070482,Beng Hong,"Richard is a fantastic host. He made the necessary arrangement to find us through his assistant Julie We were held back due to late plane arrival and got a bit dis-orientated at the Metro. She went around looking for us. That was a big help.

The place is exactly as shown in the photographs. Will definitely consider staying there again in the future and would also recommend my travel buddies about this place."
8895659,277376877,2018-06-16,185532379,Juan José,"La casa es muy cómoda y espaciosa la cocina ofrece la oportunidad de ahorrar en un desayuno o una cena ya que funciona de maravilla y tiene lavavajillas con lo cual no trabajas de mas la ubicación es buena porque tienes un metro muy cercano y eso facilita los traslados al centro de París en poco tiempo el piso esta muy limpio y es muy muy tranquilo por la noche lo que viene muy bien para descansar después de un largo día de turismo.
Es apropiado para familias con niños.

En cuanto a Stéphane es un gran anfitrión amable y comprensivo con algunos cambios en la hora de entrega agradecemos infinitamente el trato hacia nuestra familia en especial nuestro hijo Diego agradece mucho que le dejase jugar con algunos juguetes de la casa : )
Estamos seguros que cualquier persona que se hospede en su casa se sentirá igual de satisfecho que nosotros.

Es la primera vez que alquilamos en Airbnb y estamos contentos con el resultado."
21087435,422838343,2019-03-12,56353848,Elizabeth,Yasmine’s apartment was wonderful! She and her daughter Marie were so welcoming and there were so many thoughtful touches from delicious daily breakfasts to all the beauty products and amenities I might need. They even invited me to join them for wine and snacks one evening before dinner.  I felt so at home there. The apartment is also in a perfect location and beautiful neighborhood. I highly recommend Yasmine’s place for anyone traveling to Paris!
19975532,464231457,2019-06-05,11712777,Olga,"Все безупречно! Квартира расположена не просто удобно а ооочень удобно! Через дорогу вход в метро на станцию Reaumur-Sebastopol сразу на 2 линии - 3 и 4. В соседнем здании супермаркет Monoprix в котором есть все: продукты (на -1 этаже) одежда косметика товары для дома и т.д. Неподалеку улица Montorgueil на которой есть и супермаркет и сырные лавки и бары с кафешками и ресторан с улитками и вообще чего там только нет )) В принципе до всех центральных достпримечательностей можно ходить пешком без всякого метро.
Квартира оборудована всем необходимым удобно готовить. Кастрюли и сковородки ищите в шкафчике под раковиной вилки-ложки - в ящичке под лестницей.
Мансарда двухуровневая постель наверху будьте осторожны лесенка довольно крутая. Да не забывайте уходя закрывать окошко над постелью чтобы дождиком все не замочило.
Есть фен и даже всякие гели и шампуни в ванной комнате.
Звукоизоляция отличная как будто соседей вовсе нет. Хотя они точно есть окна были открыты.
Единственное что можно с натяжкой назвать недостатком - отсутствие кондиционера. Но в старинных домах в центре это скорее норма.
Во время нашего проживания не работал лифт. Нас встречал друг хозяина Кристоф донес чемодан наверх все показал-рассказал был все время на связи спасибо ему большое!
Самого Поля во время нашего прибывания в Париже не было но письменное общение оставило самые приятные впечатления ))
В общем однозначно рекомендую!"

17859378,335178902,2018-10-11,39884303,Yong,Perfect stay so comfy and welcoming interior. Safe private parking lot next to the flat was an extra plus in Paris. 2 weeks stay was just wonderful thanks to this pleasant flat. Sylivie and the guardian couple were so friendly. The bakery just across the street (opening at 7:30) allowed to have a delicious parisienne breakfast every day. Open market on Sunday is worth visiting. Perfect moment to grab some fresh local foods for brunch or quick lunch. I strongly recommend this place.

6671355,155665590,2017-05-28,8320405,Adam,Nice quiet room clean and a comfy bed in a safe block in Paris near republique. Christophe is a really nice guy and made me feel welcome. Highly recommended!

11563663,322429556,2018-09-13,61371993,Alexander,An apartment is in the city center 10 min walk from Notre Dame de Paris. Location is just perfect. Apartment is small but there is everything that you would need there. We spent 5 nights and had no complaints. The bed is good enough for a couple. There is a bath tube and relatively big bathroom (taking into consideration the overall apartment size). It was quiet no noise from neighbors and no noise from the street. The view is good as well. The only drawback is that the apartment is under roof and there is no elevator you will have to walk all the way up. Was not a problem for us at all. Overall it was a great experience and Lisa did all she could to make our stay pleasant. So we can recommend this apartment
22381828,455152907,2019-05-19,63346002,Sesha,Had a pleasant stay at Philippe's place. Nicely located about 25 minutes by transit from the hustle and bustle of city. Very quite and safe neighborhood with access to cafe bar and convenience store within 5 minutes by walk. Apartment had pretty much everything you need for a short stay. Philippe communicated promptly and helped with my late check-in. Gladly recommend this place.

The communication with Guillaume was perfect! Even if we didn't meet at all he gave me the best advices and I had the feeling that I know him already for years. 
Just perfect! I'll come again! :)"

11529623,114152628,2016-11-16,7238905,Wayne,Pierre had a family matter so we didn't get to meet him. We could follow the directions to the place as well as pick up the keys and he sent the codes for the gate and lift. We were surprised that there was no cupboard space provided for our clothes as the cupboards were  locked???. The apartment was very nice and had a balcony overlooking the street. Pity the hairdryer was not available. We enjoyed the apartment 
221754,203990260,2017-10-16,2537754,Margaux,"Valérie's apartment is a haven of style and calm in the middle of hectic loud and beautifully chaotic Paris.

Her place is a delightful hidden nest with a style that manages to be both so Paris and so New York very stylish yet cosy and genuine. 

Lovely location to explore the heart of Paris's diversity Stalingrad station (on metro line 2) being at the intersection of several iconic neighbourhoods and reaching some of the most lively places in the city. 

As a host Valérie nails down communication and the breakfast cookies and organic tea were a nice touch."
8789127,205095228,2017-10-21,24737198,Lisa,Appartement conforme aux photos fonctionnel et très propre. Fabien est un hôte très arrangeant. Je recommande vivement.

Located in a nice street with good restaurants within a few streets and supermarket bakers and day time cafe. We found the local restaurants reasonably priced and friendly service. A great trip with a perfect apartment with amazing views to return home to at the end of the day! Highly recommend this apartment for a break in Paris. 
23179840,474356023,2019-06-23,267382438,Fabien,Un appartement très propre et confortable un hôte aussi bien réactif qu'il est sympathique : au final nous avons un combo gagnant et un très bon séjour merci encore :)
3492606,57020133,2015-12-21,46851881,Helen,Our host was most welcoming having left everything in place for us. The apartment was exactly as described with additional home comforts. We were delighted. The area was excellent and very central. 
15211728,120553840,2016-12-11,5462859,Jeremy,Great location and host Arnoud was very acconodating with our request for earlier check in. Cosy room and clean well kept space. Recommended if you want to stay a bit outside the centre of town - very easy access to all the main areas by bike or subway. Perfect for our 1 night stay 
2476875,260025327,2018-05-03,2471248,Ellie,This is my second time staying in Montmartre. The apartment is conveniently located but not entirely up to expectation. Chairs are dirty the kitchen is about 1 m2 and there was lots of ants on the counter on our first day. Kitchenware is not sufficient the stove did not work and there's no water cooker. About 1 week before check-in I received a letter of instruction from the host where there were lots of detailed clarifications like soap/shampoo/tea/coffee not included there will be 40 eur extra fee for check-in or check-out outside the regular time slots basically there would be extra charges for every little favor which is normally free in airbnb apt. This is the first time I had a host so strict like that hope Franck would do some modification of the instruction letter in the future too much appendix or possible extra costs for things that should have been included or flexible gives a very uncomfortable and stressing vibe.

As the first safe box user I tried twice to get and return the key.  Will recommend to stay here. We will still choose this place if we visit Paris  again."
4340240,46278458,2015-09-09,12343230,Veronica,"Bra information fanns i lägenheten och Julie visade hur allt fungerade och var det fanns matbutiker. 
Lägenheten ligger väldigt nära tunnelbanan och det finns en trevlig carrefour några minuter bort där man kan handla det mesta.
Sängen var mycket bra och trots att duschen är väldigt liten så fungerade den utan problem!"
2873792,46320428,2015-09-09,42212677,Edward,Thibaut was very accommodating and helped make my stay in Paris a pleasant one. He also provided excellent tips and suggestions for places to visit in Paris.

Very clean and private apartment located near the Arc. Lots of cafes nearby. If you are into shopping LV Hermes etc are a few blocks away. If we are in Paris again we’ll
stay here again."
26793451,340802251,2018-10-25,111703721,Selvi,Ik had het veel beter verwacht op het aanrecht lag er gewoon nog broodkruimels. Er werd niet aangekondigt dat het op de zesde verdieping is zonder lift. En ja na een hele dag lopen is dat best wel vermoeiend. Kwam je thuis na zo een dag rook het helemaal naar sigaretten binnen. Woning was te koud. Linnengoed was niet gewassen bed in slaapkamer is super klein. Niet aan te raden dus!
2892435,24522534,2014-12-30,16353517,Praseetha,"The view is spectacular! Not only do you get a full on Eiffel Tower view out the living room patio you also get the length of Champs-Elysees from the Lourve to the Arc-de-Triomphe. And we also loved that the Metro was just a 5 min walk away. If you're looking for more local flavor than what is offered by the restaurants on Champs-Elysees then the little alley where the apartment is situated has many little brasseries with great tasting food. There's even a boulangerie dangerously close to the apartment which has divine croissants. The supermarket Monoprix is a 10 min walk down Champs Elysees. 

John was a wonderful host although we didn't have the pleasure of meeting him in person. 

The one thing that let us down was that the Wifi was not working during our stay and that made things a little hard. John did try to salvage the situation as mush as possible but with it being the holiday season I suppose it was hard to get the immediate help needed.

P.S - while we stayed the lift wasn't working throughout our stay so we had to use the staircase. It isn't insurmountable and honestly the view just made it worthwhile for us. Also we figured we were getting in our daily share of cardio in to have an extra croissant and coffee everyday  :)"
9969158,208202398,2017-10-31,42387452,Dan,The place was an excellent location. Super secure. You are right by the Metro and are able to travel all over Paris. Very cute street with shops bakery's and restaurants all within walking distance.  Very close to Notre Dame and St. Chappell.  The place was very clean and had everything you needed for your stay.  If ever back in Paris I will stay at this property. Thank you again for the great communication and hospitality.

All types of convenience shops incl. restauration within 250 yards.  

Very responsive host who stepped in immediately to have a small repair made during my stay."
504964,2496682,2012-10-03,2204579,Molly,"Our stay with Segire was perfect - both she and the cottage are unbelievably charming. Segire is a great host she made us feel at ease immediately and was very informative with great recommendations for bars restaurants creperies bakeries etc. in the neighborhood. 

The cottage was recently renovated in a very clean and modern manner - there is a lot of attention to detail and it has everything that you need. It is comfortable and cute and feels Scandinavian Japanese and French at the same time. It is part of a very cool compound of buildings I believe it was a former paper manufacturing plant. Every aspect of the building the entry door walkway doorbells landscaping and buildings themselves are beautiful and impeccably maintained - the whole thing feels like an oasis. 

The neighborhood is also awesome - our favorite in Paris. Tons of activity around the canal great restaurants and bars a cool design bookstore great shopping and an amazing bakery. Our whole experience was great I would highly recommend this place!"
15894233,430886808,2019-03-31,46032,Bilal,Paul is a wonderful host! His house is spotless and his communication style is great. We stayed in a large group (8 people) at his apartment and he was gracious in accommodating us. The apartment has a small but fully functional kitchen and enough space to sleep 6 adults (or in our case 5 adults and 3 children) comfortably. The only downside is that the apartment is right near a bar and the area gets sketchy at night.
1561152,148749183,2017-05-01,40252631,Astrid,Tres bel appartement et tres bon accueil. A recommander ;-)
17163973,195066027,2017-09-18,150627579,Leslie,"Delightful apartment situated  at the foot of Sacre Coeur (view obstructed by tree) with easy access from Eurostar/Gare du Nord via several Metro stations.   Large living area with excellently supplied kitchen (includes dishwasher and laundry).  If you like to cook bring along a favorite knife or two. The beds were very comfortable  including the sofa bed. At times there can be noise from tourists on the streets or from the late night shops so be sure to include earplugs in your kit. 

Neighborhood has grocery stores restaurants tourist shops and a fair number of ""friendship bracelet"" scammers tormenting passerbys - nothing to fear just be aware.  Walk to nearby Buttes Montmartre for additional variety of shops and less tourists.

Hint: Abbesses is under contruction so use Anvers in 2017.  Magdalena provided great directions to the apartment.   She also makes current tourist info upon arrival including Metro and bus maps."

La situation géographique est vraiment parfaite et le quartier très animé.
(Pour autant on ne souffre pas du bruit l'appartement étant au 5ème étage et donnant sur une servitude privée d'un côté et sur une cour de l'autre).
A peine sorti de l'appartement vous avez un accès direct sur la station St-Lazare.
Les commerces sont à quelques dizaines de mètres il est ainsi facile de faire un plein de course ou d'acheter du pain.
L'appartement est très agréable et bien chauffé (idéal en novembre...)
Le coin cuisine tout à fait adapté et bien équipé.
Pas de soucis sur les chambres ni la salle de bain bref nous renouvellerons probablement l'expérience une prochaine fois !"

2096243,213658095,2017-11-22,104776699,Ethan,It is a pleasant experience staying at Philippe and Serge's place. The apartment is neat and tidy stylish and morden. The bed is quite comfortable. The location is close to the transportation just at the center of Nation. The host is hospitable and helpful. Overall it was a good stay and pleasure to know the lovely couple.
942566,486832571,2019-07-13,116486441,Ilya,Absolutely amazing!! The great knowledge of ice cream industry meant you could feel the history and Angelina was really friendly and passionate and pours his heart and soul into the tour. Plus we got so much ice cream always a good outcome! Angelina was awesome and super knowledgeable and passionate about her work and the ice cream experience. She shared some secret tips about making ice cream amongst other things and also shared with us some great receipt chocolate cake and the different types of ice cream. You'll eat till full and walk out the door with many presents. Top experience and great fun. I would recommend this trip to anyone coming to Moscow.

We didn’t end up spending tons of time in the apartment but really enjoyed our stay. Tony was also very responsive and helpful. I would definitely look into staying here again if I’m ever back in Paris.

Apartment was very clean bed and sofa were very comfortable and Linda was very helpful even contacting us with updates on the strike. Would definitely stay again. 

Only thing that could tale away from it for some people is its on the 3rd floor and the steps are narrow and steep but any able bodied person would be well able to do it."
11862189,128253910,2017-01-23,85640833,Erica,Ottima posizione in uno dei quartieri più belli di Parigi: Le Marais.  L'appartamento di Claudia è a due passi dalle principali attrazioni come Notre Dame  Bastille  Centre  Pompidou  Canal St. Martin etc.  Grazie alla posizione strategica potrete evitare di prendere la metro e godervi la bellezza delle strade di Parigi. Claudia è stata molto disponibile  sia nel check in che nel prenotarci un taxi per il ritorno in aeroporto. È stato un piacere poter conversare con lei in italiano! A disposizione degli ospiti ci sono tè e caffé per colazioni veloci. Asciugamani phon e sapone inclusi. Divano letto abbastanza comodo e stanza super silenziosa indipendente dal resto della casa. È stato un week end molto bello e la comodità di essere nel centro di Parigi è impagabile!  :) Lo consiglio!

5860831,48176456,2015-09-24,10745726,Simon,We had a great time at Amandine's flat for 4 days in Paris - it's just round the corner from the Metro and down a private street so quiet and peaceful. Amandine was the perfect host with easy pleasant and clear instructions left for us to collect the keys. I would definitely stay at her place again - not a negative but be aware there are some narrow spiral steps up to the studio so don't bring big burly suitcases!

18644634,262290728,2018-05-08,131374633,Rita,The place is perfect place for people who like nightlife! It is not for families with small children!!!

The place was very comfortable for 8 of us with the 3 private bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.

The  unit is  roomy  with  two  bedrooms  a  living  room  and  a kitchen/dining  room."
8286800,205563328,2017-10-22,14606873,Laura,Fabio and his partner were outstanding hosts! They were very communicative flexible and kind. Their apartment is in an amazing location within walking distance of the Latin Quarter and Notre Dame although their neighborhood is so fun and trendy that you don't have to walk far to find a good restaurant or bar. I would definitely stay here again. Their tips for getting us to Orly and CDG were also super helpful. Merci Fabio! A la prochaine!
15007636,438227760,2019-04-16,218882808,Giuseppina,Sophia è stata davvero molto gentile disponibile e cortese. La casa è molto comoda come posizione metro vicina e dal pieno centro non particolarmente distante.
10495435,90771645,2016-08-02,81640911,Peter,The host was neutral. It was a cold experience.  He DID help us by (1) allowing us to check in early but it was a strange and unfriendly experience because he kept rushing us out and not even allow us to use the restroom.   (2) He also helped us to carry our luggage down.    Overall Paris is not like it used to be (friendly clean and luxury).  It's now opposite of that.  Thus Effiel Tower is a scary place to visit.  Beer caps trashes vendors (both legal and illegal) and most famous of all: con-artists are everywhere.   Worst there are no public restrooms and restaurants won't allow visitors/tourists to use their bathroom.  In short the location is NOT an ideal location for tourist because the only thing that you can do at this location is to see the Effiel Tower (ET) and that is it.  There are not much place to eat or shop... Paris has many things to see beside ET.  It seems this location attracts lot of young professionals.  Thus it's very noisy (not from the street but the neighbors).  The person above us had a party on Friday and Saturday's night.  To be safe next time I will use professional like staying at a decent hotel.  With the money that you paid you can get a decent 3-4 stars hotel and hopefully a little bit better and friendly service.   Then again France and its people are not like it use to be ...  After 4th time visit France I vow that I shall never return.

2066831,107021434,2016-10-09,46000909,Ali,"Clio's listing was a fantastic space to stay in during my business trip to Paris. Clio allowed me to drop my bags early as I arrived before check-in time gave clear instructions about the home and gave me a whole packet of things to do in the neighborhood and various guides to Paris. 

The listing itself is exactly as pictured very clean and spacious for two people although I stayed alone. Clio was so kind to provide coffee tea juice and a variety of snacks and breakfast items. The neighborhood is very charming and scenic right next to Canal St. Martin and a variety of bakeries cafes and shops providing an experience away from the heavy tourism areas. You can hear some traffic at night but that wasn't an issue with getting to sleep. 

Overall a terrific stay and I would definitely book Clio's listing again!"

32179179,480679581,2019-07-03,82315004,Amaya,"The place is confortable and nice. The bedroom downstairs would need some attendance for the himidity and moisty smell.
The small inner courtyard for the building is very quiet. There was a free ""help yourself sharing bookshelf"" at the entrance with some nice books we borrowed while in Paris :)
The Chapelle neighborghood is suburban like noisy and chaotic but the very close-by bus stop and metro stop make the rest of Paris quite easily accessible.
If you come by car (as we did) parking is a real problem - or a real expense!"

Assolutamente consigliato!"
1653158,34304255,2015-06-07,31744031,Michael,The apartment was clean and neat in a pleasant neighborhood with lots of local shops and small restaurants. It was very easy to reach with public transportation and subsequently to get anywhere in the city. We arrived quite late and were therefore unable to personally meet Jean-Baptiste but he arranged everything so that it was very easy for us to get the key. He was extremely helpful and friendly about all of our questions and requests. It was a very good value for the price. We would definitely recommend Jean-Baptiste as a host would enjoy to stay there again on our next visit to Paris.
4791640,224007938,2018-01-02,45071830,Gilly,"Jean-Michel and Roland were fantastic hosts and their apartment is stunning. Myself and a friend stayed there for two nights over new year and found their home to be extremely comfortable and well-equipped. The views over Paris from the apartment and balcony are stunning and the apartment itself is beautiful and very spacious by Paris standards. The kitchen was well-equipped and allowed us to cook which was ideal and the living room area was perfect to relax in. The bed was one of the comfiest I'd ever slept in and considering the central location was very quiet at night. 

Jean-Michel and Roland had produced a very detailed and informative booklet about the apartment and the surrounding areas which was really useful and very considerate of them. They were extremely communicative and helpful and although we didn't meet we felt that they were there if we needed them. 

The location was perfect - a few steps from Abbesses metro and a couple of minutes from Pigalle with so many restaurants and shops literally on the doorstep. I can't recommend this apartment enough it's hosts highly enough! Exceptionnel!"

Breakfast in the fridge was an extra and lovely touch! Self-check-in and check out was well instructed.

15736455,232152338,2018-02-04,57223053,Mélanie,Appartement idéalement situé pour ceux qui souhaitent découvrir les principaux sites touristiques de Paris. Dans ce cas la plupart des trajets peuvent se faire à pieds ou à partir des stations de métro aux alentours proches. L'appartement situé au 5e étage (ascenseur jusqu'au 4e)  donne sur une cour intérieur très calme aucune nuisance sonore. Il est situé dans un immeuble très cossu dans un quartier fort agréable dont les restaurants permettent d'apprécier la cuisine japonaise. Son équipement à minima est suffisant pour un séjour court la boxe internet fait oublier l’absence de TV. Notre accueil a été pris en compte par Philippine qui nous attendait conformément à notre demande excellent.
6241912,275616084,2018-06-11,100892509,Anton,Great place in a nice neighborhood! Hélène was very kind communicative and welcoming during our stay. We had a very flexible check-in and check-out which was great. Me and my girlfriend had a lovely stay at Hélènes place and would highly recommend this apartment in Paris. 
3739554,236408561,2018-02-19,6038897,Kate,We loved staying at Vincent's during our time in Paris. His place provided quick access to the best places in the city and had a great local neighborhood feel. Vincent was a fabulous host quick to respond to questions and flexible in our timing. We look forward to our return trip!

7397,265143330,2018-05-16,44040223,Jennifer,Franck’s place is in an excellent location near the metro and everything you could possibly need. While it is near Hotel de Ville it is amazing how you don’t hear all of the noise and bustle of the city while staying in the apartment. Franck was a great host who always keeps in touch and replies promptly if you need anything or have questions. The apartment was superb and even the pull out sofa bed was quite comfortable. We used Franck’s personal driver to get to the airport when we left (was professional and prompt) making our trip much better than dealing with the metro and the current transportation strikes in the city. I would highly recommene staying at Franck’s place.
5613148,99593036,2016-09-05,5676285,Elena,Мне очень понравилась данная студия и я с удовольствием посоветовала бы её моим друзьям. В ней есть все что может понадобится: компактная кухня с посудой и техникой гостиная (с раскладным диваном) и ванная комната. Квартира чистая и уютная вокруг много кафешек и магазинов. Седрик всегда быстро отвечал на мои вопросы и предлагал свою помощь. У меня остались только приятные воспоминания об этой квартире и её хозяине.

Ana is not a superhost for no reason. She is friendly responsive to your request and she treats you like a friend not just a guest.

Thanks Ana for everything. :) "
5190849,125365201,2017-01-05,12729383,Snezana,It's was really cosy and special place. Bernard and his representative Mark were really nice. The apartment is on the 4th floor and the view to one of the courtyards was really nice.

3261736,101933541,2016-09-16,56021723,Nick,This was a great place to stay. It was within walking distance of the Lourve and Notre Dame. The Paris public transport makes it easy to get around as well. A lot of shops are around the area especially if you're into fashion. A lot of good cafes can be found around the corner. The apartment was small but we did not need a lot of room. Remember the keys have to be sideways to remove them. Spent a good 10 minutes trying to figure it out!

The flat is located in a calm residential area within walking distance of the bustling Bastille and in the vicinity of a Metro station. Many thanks to Marc for a thoroughly pleasant stay. 
11156442,320076543,2018-09-08,99894949,Dave,A really charming flat in an excellent location.
154292,501375,2011-09-04,843418,Mel,Mattis was thankfully able to accommodate us on very short notice. He arrived on time to meet with us was easy to communicate with and the place was quite spacious for Paris standards. The only downfalls were that it is not walking distance from the Centre of Paris (although easily accessible by Metro) and the shower and toilet are combined in a room (toilet gets wet when you take a shower). But overall good value for Paris.
1500956,463467351,2019-06-03,526983,Prue,Absolutely beautiful light filled apartment in a gorgeous area of Paris. Easy check in and communication. Would stay again.

The area is very safe and near to some nice parks. The hosts were wonderful and happy to answer any questions we had (they spoke English which was appreciated!). I would stay here again and recommend to others.

7644029,197878866,2017-09-27,40702323,Jr,Claire was amazing! She allowed a very early checkin and after our flight got delayed 2 hours she still waited at the apartment for us to arrive so we could put our luggage down before exploring the city. Subway was a few minutes away which then took you about 20 mins to get to the city's main attractions. The apartment is perfect for couples. Equipt with bathroom shower washer and kitchen.   We enjoyed our stay here and recommend.

8606374,244956529,2018-03-20,172391910,Cvety,Nicolas's place is amazing - very stylish cozy and so close to the Eiffel Tower. A very nice area to live in or spend your Paris vacation in - there's some really nice cafes and bakeries nearby very close to metro/train. The room in Nicolas's flat had an amazing view at night towards the top of the Eiffel Tower and the sound system installation in the room is definitely a big plus for any music lovers. Overall this place is a hidden gem!
530288,16544153,2014-07-29,2869361,Scott,The apartment was nice - as described in the listing. We appreciated the security - there is a keycode for the main front door and another one for a secondary inner door in addition to the apartment key. Nicolas' instructions were clear/easy to follow. The apartment is in a great location - about a 10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower and on a subway/RER line. Lots of good restaurants and a close by supermarket as well. The only problem we had was with noise. The apartment faces a busy street and they was lots of construction work right outside our window. This should be much better after the work is done (signs said after August).
1621081,447185652,2019-05-03,8574804,Marilyn,Close to the Metro and RER (5-10mins) very convenient to travel around Paris. It is of really good value for the location and comfort despite the 6 flights of stairs. Would stay again
13904782,331613878,2018-10-03,14271976,Shermelle,Thanks for making our visit to Paris more wonderful because of your kindness and attentiveness to all our needs and concerns. We'll definitely stay here again on our next visit to Paris. A 5-star host!!!

Une vue dégagée un mobilier sur-mesure une vraie sdb (ce n'est pas toujours le cas à Paris) et une belle surface de vie... impossible d'être déçu par cet endroit.  
Merci pour ce WE."
6442711,250253264,2018-04-04,84456038,Eric,Sophie is quick to respond to questions and her simple beautiful (and very clean) apartment was a a pleasure to spend a week in. There were lovely touches including a welcome gift of candy. The living room gets lots of light which I appreciated very much--it was a very pleasant and relaxing place to hang out in and do a little work (my stay was a combined business and pleasure trip). The bedroom is  small but with plenty of room to put clothes in the dresser and a cabinet if you are staying long enough to unpack. (There's also a closet in the living room with plenty of hangers.)  The bed is firm; it's one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced (I wished I could take it home). The neighborhood is lovely with a small supermarket just down the block and bakeries cheese shops and butcher shops are a very short walk as is a Metro station and numerous cafés and restaurants. On Sunday morning there was an amazing farmer's market as well. The building is quite secure with a double-locked foyer which guests easily access with a key fob. There's a small elevator that is quite reliable so no worries about stairs. Highly recommended!
201257,11855481,2014-04-17,5463785,Bjørn,"This Parisian style flat met our expectations. The flat were as described and has a unique atmosphere. 5 floors up there were no noise from the street outside.
The flat is located in a nice area outside the centre of Paris but with the nearest tube only minutes away and with bus service directly to the heart of Paris just outside the apartment this was no problem.
The host met us in the apartment and after a tour round the apartment she took us round the block to show us the tube station the bus stop where to buy groceries and where to eat. All in all this was a good experience and we would love to come back to this apartment the next time we're in Paris. Highly recommended!

1300306,251640990,2018-04-08,98491696,Jack,The place is tidy compact and has everything you could need. For its location we were happy with the price we paid considering that we did not plan to spend a lot of time in the apartment. As other reviewers have said the place is small but it didn’t impact our stay as everything has a place and everything you could want is there. The location is near Norte Dame (about 5mins) and about 5 mins from a bunch of different metro stations. There are restaurants patisseries and a good nightlife nearby with the University close to here — although this apartment is out of the way so it is quiet at night too. We had a very enjoyable stay.

Es un típico apartamento parisino en su diseño y construcción lo que permite sentir mejor lo que es el estilo de vida en esa ciudad.
Genevieve fue muy amable y ella y su equipo estuvieron atentos a solucionar un pequeño inconveniente que hubo con una tubería de la lavadora por lo cual este se solucionó sin problema.
La estadía fue muy agradable y a pesar del calor del verano el apartamento es muy fresco gracias a que fluyen buenas corrientes de aire cuando se abren las ventanas. "

The layout is rather eccentric - never before have I stayed in a place where I had to walk through the bathroom to enter the bedroom and the toilet is a long circuitous walk away in the middle of the night ! -  but it’s full of interest and amenities including a gourmet kitchen and big windows that bring in the morning light. An oasis of calm in the midst of the busy city. Highly recommended!
17134085,249960229,2018-04-03,164424774,Brendan,Nadia was super-friendly and always replied super-quickly to any questions I had. She was incredibly accommodating for the entirety of my stay and her place being in the 16e is something rare to find indeed! The apartment was perfect for what I needed and I'd definitely recommend her to anyone. Thanks again Nadia!

1053609,362817349,2018-12-27,5456631,Miriam,Elisabeth's beautiful apartment in the 16e arrondisement was a gorgeous place to rest relax and explore Paris from.  Our family thoroughly enjoyed the neighborhood too which had all the conveniences within a block or two.  We walked to the Eiffel Tower and took the very convenient/frequent bus to all the sites along the Seine.  I recommend Elisabeth's apartment wholeheartedly.

Literie très confortable. A noter: plomberie un peu vétuste nécessitant un peu de patience et de souplesse.

7392235,240811861,2018-03-06,55347447,Jessica,Great spot in a fun and hip neighborhood. The apartment has everything you need and is great for someone who will be suing the place as   a “home base” as they spend most of their day out exploring. Fralma was a great and responsive host!
22594333,352379355,2018-11-25,12223823,Luiz Henrique,Veronique's apartment is wonderful with everything we need to stay in place. The apartment is located close to subway stations markets shops and restaurants. She is also a great hostess. For sure if I return to Paris I will stay there again.
6184394,103704298,2016-09-23,11081036,Juli,Clement's apartment was perfect. The location was great within walking distance to many fun things and stumbling distance to the metro. It is much larger than the pictures suggest as well. Clement met us at the train and provided small toiletries and a welcome bottle of wine which were wonderful added touches. I would recommend anyone stay here on a trip to Paris. 
778555,258577938,2018-04-29,14240118,Nicolas,Decent flat with a cosy atmosphere and all amenities. Indira's sister was very reactive and helped us with everything at check-out. Great for our long weekend stay. Well connected.
3246643,504080871,2019-08-07,155234136,Daria,Прекрасное расположение пешая доступность ко всем достопримечательностям Парижа до острова Сите 5 минут. Чистая квартира во второй комнате был помощник Пьера но мы с ним почти не виделись. Маленькая кухня  со всем необходимым можно готовить- плита микроволновка холодильник вся посуда и тд. Шумно под окнами но если их закрыть- тишина. Отличное впечатление от поездки!
24771427,358641959,2018-12-15,43896229,Jennifer,Great location! Tons of cafes and shops just 2 minutes walk. Small but efficient use of space and wonderfully decorated. Marie and Louis were very helpful and responsive.
1698210,8541637,2013-11-04,9315573,Vassilis,"We had a fantastic stay at Hermine's place a small but cute Parisian style apartment. Hermine was waiting for us  there to give us the keys even though we arrived late afternoon. Her place had everything that we need and looked just like in the photos her minimal taste in decoration is great. It's on the 4th floor of an old (as in typically old romantic Parisian style like in the movies) building situated in a very very  convenient place (near the metro st. Bolivar with supermarket and boulangerie across the street).  The neighborhood is quiet and safe near the park and the hipster canal definitely a great and hip area away from the tourist buzz (if you want to go sightseeing just take the metro and you'll be in the centre in no time). We literally fell in love with the the surrounding areas (villette and canal st matrin) the neighborhood and the apartment. 
We definitely recommend Hermine and her apartment!!"
11310067,215384467,2017-11-29,16351626,Mary,In the heart of busy noisy Montmartre you enter this courtyard and the studio inside is completely quiet and peaceful. It is very small but the amenities and overall design are phenomenal. We would definitely stay here again. Loved the kitchen and the bathroom and especially the washer/dryer combo. Gorgeous decor and very thoughtful touches. We will be back!
14092508,157027131,2017-06-02,7054873,Dahlia,Très jolie appart très bien situé au cœur de quartier branché de Montmartre et proche des métros. Bon contact avec Nicho. J'y reviendrai volontiers pour une nouvelle escapade à Paris

1959687,168283784,2017-07-09,91413218,Rachel,Very cute and French feeling apartment. Decorated very nicely. The best part is the location- can't be beat! While not family friendly it's perfect for a couple or any young person wanting to be in the most happening part of Paris. Lots of great food bars and nightlife. One drawback- fifth floor walk up so lots of stairs!
5148337,185651162,2017-08-22,121998453,Keith,We enjoyed our 4 night stay with Jean-Michel & Benedicte. We were delighted with the spacious room & private bathroom - all very clean. The location was great (about 50 metres to the Metro) & had a nice view out the window.  Shops & eating places just around the corner. The room was quiet even though it is central Paris.  We appreciated the flexible check-in.  Communication & directions were clear.

Mouna was the warmest and most hospitable host when she received me at check-in and was also always available when I needed a bit of help. The space is sparkling clean stylish has lovely windows and views and is a very nice inviting space. Would very much love to stay again if I could. Also just a few minutes' walk from several restaurants boulangeries supermarkets and the Porte de Pantin metro stop.

2041844,20037521,2014-09-22,20738237,Janet,Diego's studio was gorgeous very comfortable and very clean. Internet connection was good and strong. Even though this apartment is on the 1st floor expect some stairs to get in and out of the building. Paris is an amazing and walkable city and this location does make it easy to just walk to so many museums and other attractive neighborhoods. I think I only used 4 metro tickets in the 2 days I was there. And my train ticket to the airport was about 10 Euros (different ticket than metro ticket). Thanks Diego!
557246,451863627,2019-05-12,87043851,Kathy,Helene's family home is wonderful - very comfortable with great space. The local area is lots of fun with many cafes restaurants and so easy to get the metro or train to all parts of Paris. Helene was very quick to respond to any questions and  brilliant at recommending places to eat - three of which we much enjoyed - thank you

30422733,484001825,2019-07-08,220506391,Alexandre,Sarah and Stephanie were really nice to us even though they did not speak much English. (Hidden by Airbnb) translator helped us a lot. They treated us very well and offered us their bags if we stayed in Paris for another day. Only thing I did not like was having air conditioning in the ad I get paid for it and getting there had not. Otherwise all right.
6326942,91541462,2016-08-05,2321039,Crystal Lynn,The place is in an excellent location and a good value for the locale and the privacy. It's a tiny place but pretty typical and again a good value. It has a very good shower! Sonia was not available for check-in but provided a nice woman to help me and that was great. Sonia responds promptly to messages. I was dissatisfied with the cleanliness of the place but eventually Sonia decided to refund my cleaning fee which was fair since I had to clean some stuff myself.

14477824,199625388,2017-10-02,146079113,Lily,"Amazing location.  You really can see Notre Dame from the apartment.  Just a short walk to the metro and hundreds of restaurants.  I couldn't ask for a better location.

The apartment was nice.  The bedroom is a bit small so the bed is surrounded by 3 walls which makes getting in/out of bed a little awkward if there are two of you.  Other than that the apartment was perfect.  We forgot there was a lift because it was hidden behind a door so we spent the first 2 days hiking up and down 3 floors.  Once we found the lift we used it but it is so tiny 2 ppl can barely squeeze in.

I would definitely stay here again if visiting Paris."

This apartment is in a great location in the heart of the Marais convenient to sights restaurants etc.  It has everything one needs and is in a quiet street.

Chauffage individuel électrique qui permet vraiment de régler la température souhaitée pour ne jamais avoir froid. Toujours le désagrément des pigeons tant que ce problème n'est pas résolu et si vous êtes sensible au bruit de craquement matinal apporter des boules des quies. En ce qui me concerne des rideaux occultants pour les petites fenêtre auraient été les bienvenus mais ce n'est pas un problème bloquant on peut se débrouiller.

He answered all our questions quickly gave guidance to nice restaurants nearby and offered to look after our luggage after check-out. We will definitely come back and recommend the apartment to all we know
1002506,8976829,2013-11-30,6933665,Alicia,"This flat was indeed all the title said charming and perfect for all Paris lovers. The photo Marianne has displayed is taken directly from the window! I thought it couldn't possibly be that beautiful but it was even more than expected! Marianne met us with the keys and gave us a tour of the place. Even had a beautiful bottle of wine chilled for us and fresh croissants.
The flat was central to all attractions we were interested in. Every morning we'd go to the local patisserie and grab some delightful treats and coffee as we headed out for adventure. We'd walk past the Louvre like it was a normal activity and either take the metro to our final destination or walk and enjoy the crisp fall air. It was a fairytale vacation and we are absolutely coming back!
I firmly and honestly believe we wouldn't have enjoyed our stay near as much if we had stayed somewhere else. This flat and Marianne's kindness really made Paris feel like home for the week!"

L'animation parisienne de la rue peu perturber le sommeil de certains ou alors vous rappeler que vous êtes tranquillement en vacances à la capitale. La chambre est propre on s'y sent bien.

The apartment had everything we needed for our short trip to Paris and we really appreciated being able to cook and make coffee too! The metro was really close by to get to the  main attractions but the area its within also has really nice bakeries and places to drink and dine nearby. Carlyn was super responsive and friendly!

P.S. good to notice the top room is fall ceiling so you cant stand straight you have to bend and go to bed and come the same way."
3130108,15706863,2014-07-14,17160939,Maria,"Plus
The apartment is centrally located close to the Metro and RER station Les Halles. It is small for a family but works if you dont have to be indoors to much. The street is very quiet and we had no disturbance from the pub situated in the same house.

Minus
The apartment has no ventilation so it becomes very humid and bad air after showering and also after a nights sleep.

And we were a bit chocked when we arrived as the man opening the apartment for us wanted cash payment and a lot more money than we had agreed upon on site. As we had already paid the apartment in advance this was a bit confusing however it was settled after some telephone calls."

18458621,334034910,2018-10-08,190500578,Kimberly,"Location location location!  This was my first time using airbnb and JC was quick to respond to any query. 

He allowed an early check-in and his flat is situated in the heart of everything. 

The canals are to the left République and Le Marais to the right. Everything is a beautiful walk away. 

The apartment is light bright cozy and comfortable. I loved the Nespresso machine the comfortable queen size bed and updated shower. 

It's laid out nicely. I used the laundry rack to organize my clothes for the six days I was there. 

My last night I was there a French friend told me I was right around the corner from a fabulous restaurant and wine bar. We had a delicious meal. 

I was comfortable and as a single traveler felt safe. I slept great. The apartment is so quiet yet you're in the heart of Paris. 

I was thrilled with the flat and its location."
5211027,330903806,2018-10-01,164118639,Carmel,I would definitely recommend for people who want to be close to attractions like the Eiffel Tower etc as was easily walkable. If you want to be in the hustle and bustle I wouldn’t recommend. Very clean nice hosts nice little quirky room and very reasonable price.
1587440,286906824,2018-07-07,119504769,Antony,My mom and I had such an amazing time at this spacious Airbnb. The room was beautiful and had two large windows that helped keep us cool in the middle of July. It is a nice quiet neighborhood thats not in the center of all the tourist hub bub but still very close to all the major attractions (barely a 5 minute walk to Notre dame and st. Michel). Next time I come to Paris I will be staying here.
23695595,271819478,2018-06-02,1302023,Marco,L'appartamento di Cécile è confortevole dotato di tutti i servizi ed arredato con molto gusto. Noi siamo stati in due con un bambino ed è stato perfetto. Si trova nel cuore di Montmartre il quartiere è molto vivace ed è veramente piacevole uscire e fare due passi o fare la spesa. Cècile è stata molto gentile e disponibile per il check-in e check-out nonostante il nostro ritardo all'arrivo.
2959155,215683385,2017-12-01,156879487,Agnaldo,Sobre o espaço tudo certo. Apenas tomem cuidado com os horários de check in e check out. Para este imóvel nao há informacao explicita dos horários. Fui surpreendido com isso na hora de sair. Havia planejado sair com a família as 18h e fui forçado a sair as 12h em virtude de nao ter o horário de saída explicito na reserva. Já num segundo apartamento que havia alugado para depois desse esses horários de entrada e saída ficaram explícitos. Assim deveria ser pra todos para nao ficar dúvida. Se nao fosse o acolhimento de um amigo de Paris teria ficado na rua com a família algumas horas com toda a bagagem até poder faer o check in no outro apartamento.
34332924,447805699,2019-05-04,130890419,Sabrina,We are glad to have stayed at Alexandra's flat. It is a quiet place clean and very convenient with a bakery at the start of the street many restaurants  and supermarkets  nearby. The 2 metro lines are 5 minutes walk from the flat and they take us directly to the Champs Elysees and the Notre Dame in 10 minutes. We will definitely come back again. Alexandra is easy to deal with and is flexible with the hours.
23545434,332442566,2018-10-05,62450232,Meghan,François' place is in a great location and has everything you need to be comfortable while visiting Paris. There is a very well-stocked kitchen with multiple options for making coffee the bed is quite comfortable and the decor is very cool. This might not be the place for you if you are a neat freak as it's a historic building and therefore kinda dusty. I really enjoyed the space however as it felt very authentic and homey. I definitely recommend it!
37955111,553475265,2019-10-24,62227263,Xenia,Everything was perfect. The location is amazing a lot of restaurants and boulangeries near. In walk distance to Sacre- Coeur. Pauline was really nice. An amazing place to stay during your trip to Paris

Le fermate della metro sono a pochi passi da casa. La casa è arredata con originalità e cura dei dettagli.

29323625,446806190,2019-05-02,234807909,Vittorio,Our stay at Geraldine's flat was amazing. It's located 3 minutes away from metro/shops has a great view and the piano is a lovely touch. Cleanliness was spot on all around the house and there was even some food left for us. Kitchen was also fully equipped with everything needed for cooking at home. Neighbourhood is excellent also. Overall a great place to stay especially for families and really feels like you are at home. Thanks again Geraldine!
20281005,278483331,2018-06-18,104302769,Felicia,Marine is a very thoughtful host. She provided clear detailed and timely information and arranged for us to drop our luggage at the apartment before check-in time.  We had a nice lunch nearby and came back to a sparkling clean and spacious flat. It's a great space for a family stay. The arrangement of the rooms allows for more privacy than expected in a Paris apartment - a plus! The rooms all have generous windows with some overlooking a lovely courtyard. Nice and quiet at night. Kitchen is well-equipped and we prepared a number of delicious meals there with fresh food from nearby markets. The location is excellent with many restaurants and shops within a 5 minute walk. Metro stop is also a short walk away and there's a bus stop just around the corner. This was a special trip for us made all the more enjoyable by our host Marine her cleaning staff and the comfortable apartment and neighborhood. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!!!

2784104,548289859,2019-10-17,25964100,Aiza,"Location wise - Superb near the train stations and restaurants/ grocery. However the unit is located in the 2nd flr (0 as ground flr) so ensure you don't have big and heavy luggages..

Bathroom - shower area is a bit small you can only change clothes outside.

Cooking Area - there's no Range hood thus if you fry something or with smoke it will be smelly for the whole room.

There's a washing machine  but no english instructions how to use it. 

But overall its a good unit if you want to be near the Eiffel Tower and central Paris.. the Host is super responsive as well and considerate.  :)"
7496007,525184561,2019-09-07,128354159,Jihae,"숙소의 위치가 아주 좋습니다. 세명의 가족이 지내기에 충분합니다. 호스트의 친절로 인해 파리가 더 좋아졌습니다. 호스트는 매우 친절하며 게스트를 배려합니다. 그러나 좁고 많은 계단은 노인이나 어린이들에게 적합하지 않습니다. 무거운 짐을 가지고 있다면 고려해 보세요. 이것을 제외하고 숙소는 마음에 들었습니다.

The accommodation is very well located. It's enough for a family of three. Paris is better because of the kindness of the host. The host is very kind and cares about the guest. However many narrow stairs are not suitable for the elderly or children. If you have a heavy burden consider it. Besides this the accommodation was very good."

There is an excellent view of the Cathedral and the neighborhood is quiet with all the amenities you could desire.  There is a wine store and small supermarket within the block.  Many cafes in the area offer a variety of options.  The beds are very comfortable and the garden inside the building in wonderful.

84988,21354500,2014-10-15,18099289,Slawomir,Marjolaine was a very nice and really helpful host. Her apartment's location is perfect: in a very attractive neighbourhood only a few steps from Pere Lachaise and a metro station away. Lots of nice restaurants and bars nearby as well as a supermarket and a bakery. It's also very easy to get there from train stations (Gare de Lyon Gare de l'Est) using the metro. The flat was even more lovely than the pictures. Very clean sunny spacious and cozy. I would not hesitate to book Marjolaine's flat again. 
10844981,125849656,2017-01-07,42910487,Rachel,"Vu and Kim were very welcoming hosts and kindly gave us a bottle of wine and water for our stay. The apartment itself is well-located in the city and was well-equipped with appliances kitchen utensils etc. Great shower although we found that the water heater (at 70 liters) required taking shorter showers for full heat.

Be prepared to be cozy with your guests though as the space is on the small side. As a warning for tall people the ceiling seems to be about 3-4 feet above the bed."

Very close to the metro and easy to get to the center of the city. The description of the accommodation was very accurate except for the fact that there is no laundromat bellow the building. I had a very wonderful stay and would definitely recommend staying in Meena's apartment.

Central location more spacious than it looks in photos kitchen area with everything you need very clean extra towels and blankets strong water pressure windows to let in a nice breeze secure entrance. We felt like it was our home for a week. Eric is a very thoughtful kind host. He spent time explaining everything to us when we arrived. Check out was easy. We would stay there again the next time we visit Paris.

24745583,195894385,2017-09-21,145856630,Lindsey,Generally a good place to stay at a reasonable cost but I was misled into thinking it was walking distance to most attractions. There are public transit you can take but for me I just wished it was more central but overall decent stay. Quick and efficient customer service.

We enjoyed the fully-equipped kitchen and general cleanliness of the place. 

One word of caution is that there are no curtains/blinds so the morning is very bright. This would make it challenging for people who sleep in without eye shades.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and Stephen who welcomed us was very nice. Would stay there again!"

The floor was sticky there was gum on the wall also mucus (yes like dry mucus) and blood in one room and a lot of dust. The location is good but it was not worth it. Also the shower flooded the second day and there was a lot of other people's hair. Even Thierry was very kind we didnt like the experience. As we are paying a big amount of money for the ""cleaning"" we just ask for that a clean apartment."

28457980,465103348,2019-06-07,55196677,Katie,The stay was fine however the location is not where it shows on Airbnb. It shows it is right off the Champs Élysées however it is 5km away. This was very disappointing. The room is very small and the bathroom is tiny - hard to have a shower but if you aren’t spending much time in the room it is fine.

15097313,338730918,2018-10-20,43607564,Sue,Amazing Apartment Centrally Located!!   You will not be disappointed with Joe’s apartment.   Located close to the Champs Élysées  we were able to walk to many of the Paris attractions (Eiffel Tower Arc de Triumph and even the Louvre).  There is a grocery store around the corner and a great wine shop within a 10 minute walk.  There are many lovely restaurants nearby.  The apartment was very clean and well equipped with all the amenities you will need (Joe even makes sure there is ground coffee in his pantry for his guests).   You will have to walk up one flight of stairs but they were easily managed.  The locking and unlocking of the apartment door was easy......and the main door to the apartment complex was accessed by a key fob.  We had no issues.    Joe met us upon arrival and took the time to show us around and make sure we were comfortable and had all that we needed.  There is a shelf with many tourist pamphlets which facilitated our planning quite nicely.  The next day after arrival Joe checked in to see if we needed anything and also checked in on the day of our departure.   I highly recommend this apartment as you will not be disappointed.....  Thanks again Joe!!!

The kitchen is small but has a washer and dishwasher and plenty of dishware.  We loved the apartment although there was painting of the main steps and construction in another apartment that led to some noise and fumes.
16996094,261216627,2018-05-06,101622101,Carlos Alberto,El departamento es exactamente como se ve en las fotos. Es 3er piso por escalera. Todo nuevo muy completo e impecable. Zona comercial con muchos bares y restoranes. Muy cerca del Metro con acceso facil a todos los puntos de interes. Una excelente opcion estar en Paris y mas considerando el precio. Claro que como es realmente pequeño es mejor no ser claustrofóbico. La alarma de incendio es muy sensible si cocinas o haces tostadas pero se soluciona pronto abanicandole cerca.
9401886,58740004,2016-01-04,36977552,Pauline,La communication avec Thierry a été difficile. Nous avions réservé la veille pour le le demain mais une fois validé aucune nouvelle jusqu'au jour même 16h. De plus nous voyagions avec un enfant de 3 ans et demi et la configuration est un peu dangereuse avec un enfant avec un accès à la chambre qui se fait par une trappe. Il aurait été sympa d'au moins nous prévenir. La propreté de l'appartement était moyenne. En dehors de ça l'appartement est correct. Bien situé à 3 min du métro et des commerces. La literie de bonne qualité nous avons bien dormi.

Patricia and Nathalie were great hosts who were so attentive and kind. The home is close to the metro and has a great bar/restaurant directly across the street that I loved. It’s cozy and very spacious! Bed was so comfortable. She left a booklet that had any information we needed to know! Check in was very easy as well. It was very clean and had all amenities we needed. Not to mention how great all the decor was too! Thank you so much for letting me stay at your amazing home!
4084794,152187365,2017-05-15,15596640,Samina,We stayed two nigths in the nice and very small but sufficient flat which seems to be Alexandre's own appartment. He was really nice and helpful our check-in and check-out was just as easy as possible. The flat is perfectly located close to Gare du Nord Sacré-Cœur and Montmartre.

25516176,366066409,2019-01-02,93937663,Sophie,"Marvin's place is conveniently located close to many shops and public transportation options. The environment is calm and the bed comfortable so we were able to sleep very well. 

In terms of communication and assistance Marvin is very reactive and available to help it was very easy to interact with him and get our occasional questions or requests addressed. 

In terms of value for price Marvin's place is definitely a great option."

10585822,537935243,2019-09-29,257481444,남희,뷰가 좋은 숙소! 뷰가 너무 좋아서 힐링됩니다! 지하철도 가깝고 에펠탑도 20분내로 걸어 다닐수있어서 위치도 좋았어요. 주인이 집에 잘 계시지 않아서 눈치보지 않고 편하게 쉬었습니다. 청결은 호텔스럽게 깨끗하거나 청소를 해주는건 아니지만 짧은 기간이라 괜찮았습니다. 좋았어요!

17875085,331613405,2018-10-03,21065725,Deb,"Vincent's Airbnb is very well located with more than 1  metro station  close at hand as well as  lively local streets with everything we needed (many shops patisserie cafes grocery stores & banks.) The neighbourhood was safe. Vincent is an excellent host meeting us at the apartment showing us its features offering suggestions & walked with us to show us the patisserie grocery store etc. He responded quickly when we had questions & was very accommodating with check in & out.  The apartment was very very clean comfortable bed great shower & had everything we needed.  We self catered breakfast & sometimes supper & had  everything we needed  to do so.  
The apartment is described well on the Airbnb (Website hidden by Airbnb) is not large but was very comfortable for us  while we were there for 5 days.  There is not a lot of natural light & there is no view.  That is the only reason we did not give it the Excellent stamp. In every other way it is a super place to stay!  Highly recommended!"

23090336,260828607,2018-05-05,157892307,G H,The area is great! It has lots of charming bars restaurants and parks.  It’s also so convenient for Central Paris and for Gallieni where you can catch coaches to other regional towns. The flat itself though small is well presented and in a quiet street. It’s close to a number of metro stations trams and bus stops including one that goes direct to CDG Airport.

10261821,527559055,2019-09-11,59113178,Kate,"Geraldine place was just off main st of Montmartre  around the corner is the metro restaurants bars and shopping. Whilst a little noisy on Sat night it was a small price to pay for the great location. 

Montmartre was a great place to stay down the other end of the main road (a 5 min walk) the hotel has a rooftop bar with a great view of Paris.

Her apartment was compact but lovely. The staircase whilst narrow and steep was not an issue. I would definitely stay here again."

La ubicación es genial está a menos de 5 minutos caminado del metro cerca de restaurantes bares y cafés. El departamento es cómodo hasta para 4 personas y está equipado con instrumentos de cocina blancos y lavadora. Es un lugar ideal para pasar una estancia maravillosa en París.  
2765864,14172351,2014-06-13,12017748,Yves,La promesse d'un séjour original était au rendez-vous. Nous avons passé deux nuits très agréables au centre de Paris. Hervé est un hôte fort sympathique souriant et accueillant. Diner sur le pont en regardant les bateaux mouche glisser sur l'eau enchanté pas les lumières du soleil couchant jouant sur les flots et les façades des immeubles est une expérience inoubliables.
13838639,244180956,2018-03-18,2166383,Claudio,"This cosy and wonderfully quiet studio flat is in a very convenient location to visit major tourist attractions like the Eifel Tower and Trocadero - everything in walking distance and also close to various Metro stations.

24982252,534780810,2019-09-23,35700435,Katie,"Jean's place is a lovely apartment well designed and in a fabulous location within Paris (particularly if you want to enjoy the nightlife). There is an elevator up to the floor which is very useful with large bags!
However we want to highlight a few things:
-we were told that a lot of drawers and cupboards in the kitchen and bedrooms were off limits and even the kitchen oven. There were notes throughout the apartment telling us not to use things. We didn't feel entirely welcome.
-we were charged a cleaning fee (no problem with this) but were told to wipe down the shower after each use clean the kitchen thoroughly before checkout and most of the apartment was off limits for eating food anyway
-only a small amount of essential items were stocked e.g. toilet paper cooking oil hand soap and dishwashing liquid"

1321993,19075124,2014-09-06,938788,Magdalena,"Anne was there when we arrived. She gave us the key and answered all our questions. The apartment was as described and shown in the picture. 
Throughout our stay she was very helpful when we had questions and responded right away. 

I was surprised and loved how quiet the apartment was though there are lots of neighbors and we had the windows open because it was warm. The apartment is spacious with 600 sf and has the old Parisian charm.  There is a dishwasher and wash machine. 

We had great breakfasts with fresh croissants and petits pains from the bakery every morning. Anne has the same espresso machine we have at home though she uses biodegradable capsules. Remove the capsule right away. If not - like we did first- it swells up and gets stuck. 

It was a 5 minutes walk to Place de la Republique. We mostly took the Metro. We shopped at the nearby grocery and vegetable shops. 

We had a great week in Paris and enjoyed staying at Anne's apartment. "

The location is also very nice at about a 10 minutes walk from the Gare de Lyon in a quiet street with greenery close to restaurants cafes supermarkets and the access to the Metro Line 1.  There is an elevator in the building and the host was waiting for me when I arrived which made getting the apartment very easy. Thanks Paolo!
1255513,11582302,2014-04-08,11666912,Gretchen,We had a fabulous stay in Claude's apartment. Claude is a wonderful host who makes sure you are looked after!

He had also provided us with food for breakfast fresh fruit milk & I can't forget the Nespresso machine (with plenty of pods...but no George Clooney

On some nights with the windows open it was a little noisy but you are in a lively area with restaurants and bars. The noise never prevented us from sleeping. Having a washer was super handy allowing us to pack light. When the internet went out Giorgio sent Georges over to help fix the problem and he did. Georges also checked us in and showed us around the house. Check in was easy and at the time we had arranged. It is a wonderful comfortable home.

6657948,539418695,2019-10-01,212868192,Joris,The location is perfect. Take in consideration this is not a room for long stays and is located in a corridor with students (one that fantastically plays the banjo at 3-4AM) again this is something you'll need to consider when booking here. The room is small but ok for short term stays. There was no Toilet paper and towels as mentioned in the advertisement this was a shame for I didn't bring any because they should be there. Area around room is nice metro nearby as the supermarket. I do recommend this room if you are in need of a short stay and need something central. Olivier is a nice person.
36110521,538775289,2019-09-30,197192860,Sarah,Micheal’s studio was very centrally located in the Centre of Paris just 2 minutes walk from the Louvre. The apartment was close to lots of local shops restaurants and everything you could want. The check in process was easy and whilst the apartment was small for 3 people it was what was advertised and the location easily made up for it. Food nearby is delicious and the location was just exceptional and saved lots of $$$ on cab fares. Will definitely stay there again when next in Paris.
11984821,134082820,2017-02-26,109544722,Sherry,"Alexandre's apartment is simply beautiful spacious and located in a very central location. It also overlooks a small and pretty park. I can't say enough good things about Alexandre and his apartment. We were four adults and two children and there was more than enough space for each of us to have privacy if wanted. The kitchen provided us with all necessary supplies we needed to cook especially since we had young children and could feed them in the morning make a lunch as well as the ability to make dinner if we did not go out. Wifi tv and music is available and lots of books if one reads French. 
As stated previously the apartment is centrally located one Metro line across the street and another a couple of blocks away. Restaurants and a Monoprix(small grocery store) are also nearby. Alexandre was a very gracious host answered any questions when contacted and I feel went beyond what I expected when he helped by providing a taxi for our departure VERY early in the morning. I really do not know if we would have been able to find one at that hour without his help. I highly recommend this host and his apartment and hope to come back in the near future. You will not be disappointed.

20278124,407484398,2019-02-02,57370001,Sophie,Nous réservons très souvent des logements AirBnB à Paris lors des hospitalisations de notre fille. C'est la première fois que je suis confrontée à un logement dans cet état. Très déçue nous traversions une épreuve pénible et n'avions pas le temps de chercher une autre solution de logement. Entre les draps tachés des couverts ou casseroles sales rangés dans les armoires beaucoup de cheveux dans la douche ce logement m'a écœurée.

There’s a grocery store right across the street for those nights you feel like staying in. Pascal was an awesome host and his place was clean and spacious. There’s even a laptop in the room for you to use. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to a Paris!

16852946,290877647,2018-07-15,163496651,Nicole,Stylish apartment in a great location - very close to metro stations shopping and many restaurants.  The apartment was the perfect size for our party of six and quite clean and attractive. The communication with the host was quick and helpful and when we had an issue with the hot water they responded promptly.  The building is beautiful with a lift for luggage but be warned the neighbors/landlord do not tolerate noise of any sort in the hallway and will definitively let you know.  
6252911,197271525,2017-09-25,38399988,Claire & Logan,We stayed in Beatrice's apartment for 3 nights in September. It was a wonderful location the apartment was very clean although small. The bed was comfortable and the balcony was very nice in the evening. It is located within walking of 2 Patisseries and a grocery store so we were able to get breakfast and also snacks for the evening. The communication with Laure was great as our flight was delayed but she made arrangements for us to get the key and it was very easy.  We were able to also walk to the Metro (5 minutes) and get everywhere we needed.  Thank you for a great beginning to our European vacation!

Just a few steps away from the Metro station Commerce from where you can get to all the important sightseeing points in Paris. Rue Du Commerce offers lots of shops and food so you won`t miss anything you need to enjoy our stay. Thank you Julia for your kind and friendly attention to our needs.

Me senti à vontade mesmo sabendo que estava no apartamento de alguém estranho. Tudo estava limpo e organizado e funcionou perfeitamente. Gostei de ter a confiança da anfitriã em todos os sentidos. Desde a entrega das chaves até a devolução já que não tive nenhum contato físico apenas pelas mensagens.

The apartment actually felt familiar from viewing the photos and was a good place to stay in a great part of Paris. 
Metro stations in short walking distance  as are many places to eat. Try Nomos just along the street if you want something a bit special. Jeff's apartment is small but perfectly formed! Jeff booked my taxi to get me away to my train which was extra help to complete a memorable stay.

1169377,282101133,2018-06-26,3699624,Lily,A very interesting home to stay in decorated with lots of intriguing art.  I especially liked a piece in the kitchen.  In addition to the art a large collection of music records and books entertain adults while the toys entertain children.  My three year old loved it.  I had an issue with the door lock but the host was very understanding and we agreed on a good resolution.  Would recommend strongly!

6986069,82105053,2016-06-26,48720559,John,The listing was exactly as advertised. Wonderful location spacious rooms for all 11 of us including an infant crib. Solange was very accommodating and welcoming when we got there - gave a tour of the apartment and had towels etc. all layed out for us. There is a lot of street noise (mopeds car doors closing etc) but that's just city living. We also had the windows open pretty much the whole trip. There is no real casual seating area aside from a few kitchen chairs and what I can only describe as large bean bag type chairs. It was fine tho as we didn't spend much time in the flat. Only 1 toilet for 10 people so be aware of that. Merci Solange et Thomas!

All arrangements were perfectly managed and the room is extremely comfortable and welcoming with a great bed and beautiful views out over the Paris rooftops. The neighbourhood is reasonably central a bit funky and fun to explore - Canal St. Martin and this part of the Right Bank are new areas for me in Paris.  
I would return next week if I could... Experience could not have been better."

34561608,487615904,2019-07-14,49212813,Jérémie,"L'appartement et la chambre était conforme à la description propre et lumineux. La chambre donne sur la cour intérieure et est extrêmement calme. Nous y avons passé la nuit du 13 Juillet et malgré le bal des pompiers dans une rue adjacente nous avons pu dormir la fenêtre ouverte. En fermant la fenêtre on n'entend vraiment plus aucun bruit.
C'est un endroit parfait et idéalement placé pour passer un court séjour mais je n'y viendrait probablement pas pour une longue durée. L'escalier pour monter à la chambre est étroit et ce doit être compliqué d'y monter une grosse valise.
En tout cas nous y avons passé une bonne nuit."

4579770,27831413,2015-03-13,19657536,Nilson,"I had almost no contact with Diego and Maggie - they're sometimes quite hard to communicate with - but worry not they will respond and provide you with all the info you need. My direct contact there was with Mark who was very very nice and helpful!

About the appartment per se it's exactly as described: the internet is fast (you can watch netflix movies without interruptions its kitchen has everything you need it's clean confortable has a good and neaty bathroom is nicely heated (very important the city was a bit cold during our visit)... oh and there were also bonus: sugar tea sachets an espresso machine and a few coffee capsules. A very nice touch!

It's located on a very interesting area filled with all the decadence and bohemy you could expect around the Moulin Rouge: various ""massage"" parlors pubs lounges and places to eat. 15 blocks away from the subway in a very active area at night so you can arrive late without fear. There's a nice supermarket close by to get your supplies and you just need to wander a few blocks to get into the heath of Montmartre. 

If you're in doubt of where to stay in Paris this is the place. 
I thank the hosts for a nice stay!"
911746,51113762,2015-10-18,36500152,Carmen,Nathalie se ha comportado muy bien con nosotros. El apartamento era ideal para los 6 miembros que éramos. Las camas eran muy cómodas. La parada del metro a unos 3 minutos de casa pero nosotros hemos hecho mucho a pie. En la zona había mucho ambiente pero en la casa no se escuchaba nada. La próxima vez que vayamos a Paris vamos de nuevo allí. Muchas gracias

The gardienne the lady is very very friendly. Everyone will love her. Although she can not speak English there will be no problem to communicate with her. And one restaurant behind the house is really nice. If I will go to Paris a second time I will no doubt choose Ben again!

Le Marais is beautiful and this apartment is perfectly located a short walk to sights like Notre Dame and even shorter walk to shopping and food (like rue des rosiers). The Entrance delivers you into an elegant and quiet courtyard indeed the apartment has a countryside feel. Stanley was available and attentive to requests through text and email. This was a the right place for us and our 2 teenagers. Great Thanks to Stanley I look forward to coming back and staying there again.

Nous avons particulièrement apprécié notre séjour parisien dans cet appartement ou nous reviendrons avec plaisir !
Enfin Patricia a été particulièrement disponible pour répondre à toutes nos questions de façon quasi immédiate à chaque fois et nous a énormément facilité la vie en acceptant de nous garder nos bagages un peu plus tard que prévu.
Le top ! "

23960184,507996590,2019-08-12,259993834,Sally,Love the suite which is very clean and the host very quick in response from time to time when you need anything. Nearby the suites there’s a cafe thats very friendly with delicious food and drinks. Will surely recommend everyone to stay here when in Paris for vacation or works. Thanks Edgar!
534568,3741258,2013-03-10,5076150,Bryan,I would highly recommend this flat to anyone visiting Paris. The apartment is exactly how it appears in the pictures. Maxime is a great host who returns contact immediately and supplies you with detailed directions to the apartment. Once there he is more than happy to answer any questions you may have and give you recommendations of things to do throughout the city. He is very sociable and makes you feel right at home. The location is fantastic and allows you to explore the city by foot as there are great sites all around you (Notre Dame Cathedral Luxembourg Gardens 10 minutes) and if walking isn't your thing there is a bus stop right out front and a tube stop right up the street. If you aren't in the mood for site seeing there are tons of great cafes and restaurants in the area (one of my favorites was Cafe Lea and is directly next door). On the weekend there is an amazing street market in the area with great foods wines shops etc. I was enjoying myself so much I decided to extend my stay fir another week with no problem.
20198540,313894048,2018-08-26,51937817,Teresa,El departamento es buenísimo para el precio que se ofrece. Lo que es importante tener en cuenta es que hay que subir 6 pisos en escalera para llegar a él. Para nosotros no fue problema y volvemos felices con las piernas mas fortificadas jaja
9264360,139605809,2017-03-26,88326559,Simona,Christina's place is in the perfect location and flat itself is great too. We found everything we needed. If you don't mind to sleep in a bunk bed and stay at the small space  it is the right option for you ;)

3257890,23189514,2014-11-24,23828094,Katelyn,"The Pocket Loft is a wonderful little place in the heart of Paris. We really didn't appreciate how amazing this place was until we got there: it is literally a short walk from the Moulin Rouge and the photos definitely don't do it justice. We felt like true Parisians for the weekend we stayed and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone wanting to disappear into a new culture for a little while.

Natalia was a great help getting us settled in. She gave us a warm welcome when we arrived and knew lots about the local area. She designed the interior and we're very happy that she welcomed us into her flat."

Hemos acertado un coqueto moderno limpio y perfectamente equipado. Junto a la circunvalación de París acceso fácil. Barrio nuevo ningún ruido a la noche. Camas cómodas incluso la cama nido. Tranvía a la puerta y metro a 6 minutos andando. Buena y barata oferta de restaurantes en la zona para cenar.
Rozzen ha estado siempre atenta a nuestras preguntas. Muy amable.

14530643,235899680,2018-02-18,47276303,Irma,Het verblijf bij Mathilde was erg leuk. Een typisch Frans appartementje met authentieke details. Het appartement was klein maar Mathilde en Romain gaven ons veel privacy. Het is een leuke buurt en de metro is vlakbij gelegen. Oftewel: een aanrader voor een weekendje in Parijs!

The place is small but it’s your typical Parisian apartment and I was used it to it cause I lived in Paris before but for those who aren’t it’s small and the shower is small and I’m slim person but for me the apartment was perfect. The communication is great and very helpful. Overall good place to stay

7252001,162008087,2017-06-19,117893362,Yulia,We stayed in Fernanda's appartment for 16-19.06.2017 me my husband and two children 9 months and 9 years.Appartment is exactly like on photos and even more charming 7 floor typique Haussmann building last étage  with lift! View from windows in living room and child bedroom just amazing - Tour Eiffel:) there is no climatisation  but even it was very hot this time in Paris it was quite comfortable in a flat. No problem with hot water - boiler works so fast that we even didn't realised that it's not central (Website hidden by Airbnb) we never had a problem to take douche. Fernanda was very well-coming owner and very attentive to all our special requests( baby cot for our 9 months daughter  late check-in and check-out). She also leave for us good instructions and map. She really take care of us like her friends:)) Super host!! Wi-fi in flat works well. Just on another side of street there is supermarket Franprix next building 2 farmacie dry cleaning on ground floor - cafe Dynamo where we had our breakfast next door - fitness centre. Calm residential area. Just in front - bus station. Two metro stations Jaurès and Fabien Colonel just 2 minutes by foot . With these lines you can reach centre in 20 min.Amazing park Buttes Chaumont and canal also close - max. 10 min by foot. We absolutely recommend this appartment for couples also with children who would like to feel real paris lifestyle!
18131990,476358794,2019-06-26,5156618,Jenny,Arbia and Ronan's place is great. The apartment was stylish and spacious and worked perfectly for our family.  The location is easy walking distance from many attractions and delicious dining places. Arbia and Ronan made us feel welcomed and the amenities were great for traveling with children (the washer and dryer was really great after an accident involving a white shirt and gelato). The rooms were quiet and it was a great escape from our busy neighborhood.  I would recommend to anyone without hesitation.

Direkt in der Nähe befinden sich zwei Metro Stationen und zum Momatre kann man gut laufen! Der afrikanische Markt um die Ecke hat uns erst etwas beunruhigt wegen dem regen Treiben. Aber wir haben uns dann nach kurzer Eingewöhnung sicher und gut in der Gegend gefühlt!  Ein Supermarkt und eine Apotheke sind auch direkt um die Ecke. Das Appartement ist schön eingerichtet sehr sauber und lässt keine Wünsche offen. Die Fotos des Apartment entsprechen absolut der Realität. Schnelle Kommunikation und eine einfach Schlüsselübergabe hat alles abgerundet! Absolut zu empfehlen! 

Das kleine Restaurant Carotte Bleue 5 Minuten entfernt hat tolles Essen zu fairen Preisen. Lassen Sie sich nicht vom einfachen äußeren täuschen! Das Essen ist exzellent!"

21114189,244698672,2018-03-19,41730453,Megan,I would definitely recommend staying in Carlo's apartment. It was in a very cool spot- perfect place to both eat out/go to wine bars or to pick up your veggies/meat/seafood/bread and cook at home. Close to metro too!
1470378,272372347,2018-06-03,33859783,Sarah,Had a wonderful time here! The hosts were so kind and helpful and the apartment and surrounding area was perfect and charming. Thank you so much Bertrand!
273780,1523206,2012-06-20,2330143,Ruthie,"Firstly Sabrina was a great host. She was flexible with the check in & out times. 

The apartment is in a great location. 1-2min walk to the Concorde metro. The metro is located outside of the Tuileries Gardens. and your a few stations away from Champs Elysee shopping strip & Arc de Triumphe. The area is safe at night. (I was traveling alone and for the first time in Paris)

The apartment is on the ground floor and perfect for 1 or a couple. There's a kitchen and washing machine and also wireless internet. 
It can be bit noisy if your a light sleeper or like to sleep in in the morning since the apartment is opposite the lift to access the other floors.

I would stay at this apartment again if I do visit Paris again."

It felt safe at all times. Metro station very close. We were able to walk to all the places like marais jardain royal Ile de la cite rive gauche though we did have to walk a bit. But for us that is the purpose of being in Paris. Overall great place to stay!
36907063,516487216,2019-08-24,190936255,Francesca,Sconsigliato. Benché host gentile e bel quartiere alloggio davvero molto sporco e fatiscente. Non abbiamo passato lì nemmeno una notte.

8551324,221123104,2017-12-25,44218578,David,If there is a place in Paris I'd like to return this room is on my #1 spot. Sara was extremely helpful and kind since we started talking giving detailed and accurate information about the place and how to reach it. The room is very comfortable and clean! The bathroom too. The place  is close to the metro station like a 5 to 10 minutes walk so it's really convenient. There are many places to eat and stores around. I'd definitely stay again with Sara and the future. Thank you!
7283217,198370185,2017-09-29,47625865,Justin,"Such an awesome place! Stayed in Paris for 17 days so it was nice to have one place to call home. Having the bed up the stairs really opens the apartment up leaving you plenty of room for at least two people maybe three before it starts to get crowded.  We were able to cook meals (tons of different grocery stores within walking distance) at the apartment and even wash laundry. The shower was big enough maneuver even with the toilet compared to many other Parisian apartments. Wifi and the TV even gave us a chance to unwind and watch some movies after a long day or the occasional lazy mornings we had. Very quiet building too! Plan on walking up five floors though. No elevator but we didn’t mind the workout. Especially after all the bread we were eating during the day. XD

There was a great bakery down the street and a bike station for those willing to try to dance with the Paris traffic. It was close to many busy streets where a lot of locals ate dinner and had drinks late at night. It was a nice addition to our long stay to try and blend in with the locals. Four metro lines were right around the corner if we ventured too far and needed to get home later at night. It was a very short walk to Les Halles if you need to get some shopping done. We were able to walk about 20 minutes to get to Notre Dame and this awesome outdoor market where we had the best sandwiches. 

Dominique was such a great host. He was able to accommodate our early check in and messaged with us during our stay to make sure everything was still going well. Him and his apartment were one of the biggest highlights of our trip."
5108396,42769845,2015-08-15,40225554,Natasha,I had a fantastic stay in Edgar's apartment while visiting Paris with my family.

4601315,523639169,2019-09-04,24766815,Debra,Pierre-Marie is a superb host. He anticipates anything you might enjoy including fresh flowers goodies from Le Grand Epicerie tea from Mariage Frere toiletries from Aesop. The apartment is stylish and spotless. We love the location walkable to many nice restaurants and shops. It is also close to our favorite food emporium Le Grand Epicerie and Le Bon Marche. The metro and train station are a very close walk. We also used Pierre-Marie’s driver who is very kind and on time. We look forward to return visits and consider this our home in Paris.
180950,425840079,2019-03-19,215732138,Alessandro,L'appartamento di Dominique è piccolo ma molto carino e perfetto per due persone pulito e confortevole. Zona collegata molto bene si raggiunge facilmente qualsiasi punto della città con al massimo 30 minuti di metropolitana. Il letto è molto comodo (cosa essenziale quando si cammina per Parigi tutto il giorno e la sera si è stanchi!) e in generale l'appartamento ha tutto quello di cui si può avere bisogno. Ci sono vicini vari supermercati e ristoranti; sotto casa c'è una panetteria molto buona. Anche se non abbiamo incontrato personalmente Dominique ha sempre risposto velocemente a tutto ed è stata gentile e disponibile.
18702248,272221263,2018-06-03,81511985,Joanne,"This little apartment was a good place to stay for a quick trip to Paris (though it would have been too small for a longer stay - we are a family of 3). It was clean and equipped with the basics and well located for public transport and getting about to explore Paris. 
Dhirat welcomed us and made sure we had everything we needed. He continued to be helpful throughout our stay and answered any questions we had very quickly."
18222230,177234673,2017-08-02,128734090,Victoria,The apartment location is very central and close to most of the attractions . Many great restaurants near by . The apartment located on the ground floor with a glass door inside a court yard. It felt safe.

There are also Nespresso machine for a coffee drinker like us  thanks to amaury for that. Though we didn't get a chance to meet amaury in person his instruction is good enough for us to understand. Toiletries amenities available as per described. The only thing is when you carry a heavy bags you might have to physically  prepared to climb the 6th floor. The rest all is good n merci amaury for your hospitality. Hope to stay there again au voir!

The flat is located really conveniently - it's on the ground floor metro stations were nearby and most of the shopping areas are quickly reachable on foot. 
The apartment has it's own charm although it's a bit small but it is the perfect place to stay when visiting Paris."

336904,336041914,2018-10-13,8123639,Keoni,Best part of our Osaka trip! Aki is an exceptional guide and took us to places to eat and drink in a non-tourist area to give us the true Osaka experience. We ate many different kinds of delicious food that we would not have ordered by fumbling our way through an English menu. She shared about Japanese culture and even taught me how to order in Japanese. Getting a local Japanese guide was the best thing we did on our trip. Highly recommend.
338811,226006687,2018-01-08,131451372,Birgitta,Excellent apartment with great amenities and at a great location. Hospitable hosts! Apartment on the 6th floor- good exercise but not meant for the elderly or physically disabled!
1751072,9271328,2013-12-17,4680217,Erik,"This flat is centrally located to everything in the center of Paris. It's very nice very comfortable for a couple (we didn't use the sleeping landing with two single beds). The apartment was cozy in winter and right across from a market a bakery bars and clubs. 

It is noisy and active all day and most of the night (10 AM to 0300 AM) - so bring earplugs - or be like us and have no trouble falling back asleep. We knew this going in and you can't beat the location. 

Valerio was very helpful and a gracious host."
15459510,535297973,2019-09-24,34176393,Christine,"Un séjour dans la capitale qui se termine avec un léger goût amer..
Par où commencer ?
La literie laissant à désirer le confort des aménagements plus que médiocre. La poussière apparente dans une cuisine triste indiquant une propreté et un ménage (forfait inclus) n'étant peut-être pas une priorité. J'aurai aimé voir cela sur les photos de l'appartement.
Point positif sur la salle de bain qui semble être refaite à neuf depuis peu.
J'ai loué l'appartement sur une durée d'une semaine pour deux personnes et l'ai quitté en étant simplement viré de ce dernier par sa propriétaire.
Deux membres de ma famille présents sur Paris mais n'ayant passé aucune nuit à l'appartement se reposaient en m’attendant car j’étais partie faire quelques courses pendant l'après-midi avant de partir à l'aéroport  se sont fait sortir par la propriétaire ne cautionnant pas leur présence.
Cette dernière s'est montrée agressive et toute discussion a été stérile. Je regrette d’avoir loué cet appartement."
5724631,130489641,2017-02-06,44290900,Jaclyn,AMAZING view of the Eiffel Tower! Super easy to check in. The elevator is teeny tiny (as are all the lifts in Paris) so either be prepared to bring your suitcases up the narrow stairs (6 flights!) or fitting one suitcase at a time in the lift. Besides that I completely enjoyed the studio. I didn't get to meet Phillipe himself but I did meet his friend who was very helpful and made check in go smoothly. Metro is just a few mins away walking and a bus right around the corner. Next time I'm in Paris I'm definitely staying at Phillipes place! 
3992798,349905631,2018-11-18,192956727,Andrea,Had a wonderful stay in Alexander’s home.  It was exactly as promised.  The accommodations were clean  stylish and close to metro and supermarket.  Very comfortable for the 10 of us.

Clarisse was an exceptionally accommodating host - despite me giving incredibly short notice for the request Clarisse let us drop our heavy cases at the apartment several hours before we were due. There was also a safe storage space for bags on leaving day which was a very welcome provision.

Myself my girlfriend and my parents stayed for four nights at the apartment. Both Clarisse and her daughter Eugenie were warm and welcoming when we arrived greeting us all by name and showing us around the apartment. The Jeff de Bruges chocolates and bottle of Bordeaux left for us as welcoming gifts were a beautiful touch (thank you Clarisse - those chocs were *amazing*!) and the apartment catered for every convenience. Clarisse also kindly provided some thoughtful little extras in the fridge including some milk (great for us English who are desperate to get in and make a cuppa before anything else!) some OJ some Coca Cola as well as providing plenty of pods for the Nespresso machine in the living area!

The beds were also incredibly warm and comfy and the apartment was well insulated from the sound of the main road and the other apartments ensuring a good night's sleep was had by all.

All in all I cannot recommend this apartment highly enough - thank you again Clarisse!

2009265,190410632,2017-09-04,86774883,Riley,Laurent was very nice and helpful and provided great recommendations in the area for us who came from out of town. The apartment was beautiful clean and nicer than the ad suggests. The building itself is old but the apartment is very new and modern. He and Patricia were both friendly and I would definitely stay there again!

3765140,307780055,2018-08-15,18168270,Louise,What a wonderful studio apartment in a great location. Check in was easy. Check out is early at 10am and cleaner and next guests arrived at 10.30. We were running slightly late and felt terrible that they had to wait 10 minutes. Yes our fault we were slightly late but a bit of a buffer zone would be nice.  Other than that it was a wonderful stay. Thanks Thomas. 
32972938,456360010,2019-05-21,244685741,Nicole,Great location very safe with many lovely restaurants nearby. Michael and Johanna are very responsive hosts there was some problem with the hot water in the shower and they immediately found the maintenance guy to sort it out!
25498959,323903241,2018-09-16,1800259,Emilio,We absolutely loved staying at Agnes's place. It's right in the heart of the Paris and as frequent travelers to Paris we wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. The apartment is huge with plenty of interested pieces of art around.  Highly recommend staying here!

18644149,190096293,2017-09-03,105411446,Charlie,Sara's apartment was fantastic for my short stay in Paris. It was in a great location and easily connected with the Metro just a few minutes walk. Sara was incredibly helpful quick to respond to any questions and arrival to the apartment was made easy by Sara's very clear instructions! The apartment had lovely traditional features with long beautiful windows opening to the quiet courtyard which was in perfect contrast to the busy bustling streets of Belleville. Would recommend to staying here and would definitely consider returning again for my next trip to Paris!

23066551,535745168,2019-09-25,25955159,Glen,Loved this place! The neighborhood was fun with lots of places to eat and a bakery right across the street. Easy access to several metro stations. A unique and appealing neighborhood. Would gladly stay here again. Artistic decor and everything we needed including washer iron hair dryer! Great WiFi!!
38041076,537750827,2019-09-29,2861760,John,This is a very spacious and handsomely appointed apartment. Everything you’d need to set up home away from home. Apartment opens up to peaceful garden courtyard set apart from busy boulevard by two security gates. The immediate neighborhood first appears as not so romantic as other parts of Paris but as one explores the adjacent blocks a lot is offered. Practically next door you will find market for food and bakeries. The metro entrance is across the street so you can get to touristic center of Paris in 20 minutes. Myriam is friendly and a good communicator. Check-in and -out were easy.
17345427,476403965,2019-06-26,76129412,Jonathan,Josephine was an amazing host. I locked myself out of the apartment soon after arriving and she was able to help take care of everything and get me back in even while she was traveling abroad. The apartment is cozy and has everything you need for a trip in Paris and it is in a very exciting neighborhood with lots of bars and restaurants right by Republique. I would highly recommend staying here!
7465608,142749325,2017-04-09,6207385,William,Brilliant location. Three cinemas in the street. Five minutes walk to Jardin du Luxembourg. Note it is on fifth floor.

27246387,366287069,2019-01-02,54940663,Luisa,La chambre de Mohamed m’a beaucoup plue. Elle était idéalement située près de la Gare du Nord et de l’Est à quelques pas d’une statuon de métro. La chambre était très propre et spacieuse calme et on y remarque une grande attention aux détails (peignoir savates de bain bouteilles d’eau mis à disposition) Mais c’est surtout l’accueil généreux de Mohamed qui m’a beaucoup plu et son hospitalité qui l’aurait fait se lever très tôt le matin pour me faire du thé ou un café avant mon départ si je n’avais pas eu de scrupules à le réveiller. Je recommande la chambre  et merci Mohamed !
27977240,440044744,2019-04-20,48213266,Sabrina,Very clean and tidy apartment with everything you need for a stay in paris! Also the location is very good as there are a lot of nice cafes/shops around. Only a few meters to the next metro station. And the communication with Axel worked very good too. I can defenitely recommend this place!

18945477,188932748,2017-08-31,135927048,Abdula,Mr.Audrey was really helpful and understanding and he was there whenever I needed him. However his apartment wasn't that great it was NOT clean when we first entered it. The bathrooms were not clean and one of the showers would always be flooded with water after every shower. The beds weren't clean either there were bugs in the sheets. And finally the ceiling was leaking whenever it rained.
16821477,500426238,2019-08-02,102242655,Morgane,"L’appartement est parfait pour une famille ou pour deux couples d’amis qui souhaitent découvrir Paris.
Les deux chambres sont un vrai plus car chacun peut s’isoler.
L’appartement est grand très calme et hyper bien situé et que ce soit en métro en bus ou à pied la découverte de Paris est facile.
L’appartement est très bien équipé et très propre. Seul manque à notre goût une cafetière pour que ce soit parfait.
La salle de bains est confortable et la literie récente quoique un peu ferme pour nous.
Bref nous recommandons sans hésitation cet appartement au rapport qualité prix indéniable.
Merci Guillaume"

40899,557165996,2019-10-31,17071505,Flo,Lola‘s place is very well located and we had everything we wanted and needed during our stay. Communication was quick and reliable and we enjoyed the local tips Lola provided...
1272342,139623477,2017-03-26,24564037,Daria,Julien responded to me quickly and was easy to communicate. The studio is very small I don't get used to such small spaces so for me it was a bit uncomfortable but I did understand that it would be like that. The studio corresponds to photos and descriptions there were everything I needed there. Location is good.    
1692305,54092040,2015-11-16,4997119,Amber,Coco's place is perfect for one guest.  It is in a safe neighbourhood.  I was at Coco's place for the terrorist attacks on Novemb (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and I felt very safe in her apartment.  There is pretty much all that you need in her apartment including a blow dryer.  There was no shampoo or any other toiletries but there were towels and all that you need to cook and clean.  The near by metro station is super close and you can go anywhere you want on the metro.  You can also walk to many places within 20 minutes if you prefer to walk.  The toilet is not in the room but there was never anyone using it when I had to.  Not having the toilet in the room was not a big deal at all - just don't forget the toilet paper!  The stairs up to the apartment are narrow and a plenty!  Pack light!  There is no elevator but I much enjoyed the hike up the stairs after eating all the good food Paris has to offer!  Coco is very easy to get a hold of if you ever have any questions.  You can drink the tap water I did for my entire 9 day stay. I highly recommend Coco's place if you are planning a trip to Paris. 
231442,4712097,2013-05-21,6087202,Kathrin,Highly recommended! Beautiful little apartment in the heart of Le Marais! Close to nice restaurants markets and great shopping! Judith was the perfect host unfortunately i didn´t meet her in person but she answered emails promptly and everything was well organized. I will definitely come back to Judith´s place! Thank you!!!
10584855,147172685,2017-04-25,31483987,Ann,"The apartment is splendid. I traveled with friends for a week long visit and this lovely location was our respite every evening. Everything was clean and well organized when we arrived. The beds are comfortable the views are lovely and the kitchen was very well outfitted. 
Check out the bakery right across the street we did a bit of taste testing and their croissants were some of the best! 
Each room boasted beautiful flooring and we really liked the vintage bathroom. More than enough room for the five of us. We would most certainly book again. "
3360916,67767470,2016-03-31,48473633,Timothy,"Great host and great flat! Communication prior to meeting them was efficient and very convenient for us. They gave us a huge guide explaining the neighborhood French and Paris customs/culture food and drink recommendations how to work the locks and appliances etc. 

Finding the apartment was very easy and frank was there to give us the keys. The flat itself was massive and I recommend it for any couple looking. The hosts were even nice enough to give us a bottle of wine water bread honey coffee etc all included in the fridge. 

The bathroom was very well stocked with everything you could ever need. Noise was ok from the bars across the street not a big problem at all

Thank you for being an exceptional host!"
2973339,121844476,2016-12-19,54239318,Mike,"Annick (et Pierre) était gentils chaleureux et accueillants. Ils m’ont mis complètement à l’aise – respectueux de ma vie privée mais prêts à parler suggérer des choses etc. Un joli appartement dans un quartier authentiquement parisien – la base parfaite pour mon travail.

Annick (and Pierre) were wonderful hosts during my 3 month stay. They were respectful of my privacy but always ready to chat or suggest things to do in Paris. The apartment is tastefully furnished and comfortable and having access to an en-suite bathroom made everything that bit easier. Batignolles is a great area – I loved exploring neighbouring Montmartre while easy metro access to the rest of the city made getting further afield easy. Everything contributed to making a work trip a real pleasure as well."
35161506,527534041,2019-09-11,261385672,Ana,This place is a good value for what it offers.: great location nice quiet building. Bathroom is small but everything works. Just was always courteous and prompt.
1212673,34691278,2015-06-11,25631113,Wu,The place is close to the metro and train station Javel. Only half hours walk from the Effie tower. It has a great view from the balcony. One thing very important is that it is in a safe area since Paris is not that safe overall. We have six people all of us enjoy our time here. The supermarket is only ten minutes walk away.

14677708,146457918,2017-04-23,29686490,Lisa,Excellent large apartment! Very nice for family or group of adults. Bed comfortable and there are three bedrooms to give us our own privacy. Clean and close to everything! You will not be disappointed. Right price!! Hosts are very kind and very quick with responses. Even left us some coffee and tea to help us feel settled. Full kitchen and easy to use! We made breakfast every day local grocery store very close by so super easy. Making breakfast in the apartment helped cut down on costs making this place an even better deal for us family of four! I would absolutely stay here again if we ever return to Paris. Don't go to hotel come here!!! Thank you!
21407704,211174011,2017-11-12,30495882,Clément,Spacieux et très accessible tout était parfait je recommande carrément ce studio !
717376,273211145,2018-06-05,76033790,Ken,Right in the heart of the Latin Quarter and close to a lot of the action in Paris.  Eleonor is a wonderful host!  The only cautions I would offer is that the Latin Quarter can be a bit noisy at night particularly on weekends and the apartment is on the fourth floor so there are a fair number of steps up and down.  Neither of these concerns were a problem for us - we had a wonderful time!
5724631,369327212,2019-01-10,167454506,Kala,Absolutely a perfect location for a romantic night in Paris!
31873274,508645640,2019-08-13,202903562,Ellen,Beautiful studio with a great location! Amanda was so nice and helpful. Would totally recommend!
4174533,39307032,2015-07-22,36612572,Lauren,This was an amazing studio apartment!  Pascal made us feel very welcome he answered emails very quickly efficiently and clearly.  He met us at the apartment to help us get situated; he was always friendly professional and helpful.  The listing is very accurate the apartment is very clean and is close to everything walking distance to the Louvre (and all of Paris really) the Metro and taxis.  It was quiet private and the a/c was really great to have for us a/c loving Americans!  The bed was so comfortable and easy to operate. I need to stipulate that I was concerned the bed wouldn't be big or comfortable enough but it really was a proper bed.  We had just spent the weekend in NYC before coming to Paris and this apartment was bigger than the boutique hotel room we rented in SOHO.  The apartment has one of those locks that you can lock from the inside so no one can come in when you are in there - just like a hotel.  The washer/dryer unit was fantastic.  WiFi is fast and there is even a internet phone that we used to make international phone calls to our family back home.  My husband and I think staying in this apartment was better than staying in a hotel.
3893362,411661957,2019-02-13,239578098,Lívia,It’s a little cosy place to stay. Very equipped with everything very close to the center.
1986056,94028079,2016-08-14,40270817,Eva-Kristina,"The apartment is a very good place for a group to stay. Perfect location: easy walking distance to the touristic part of Montmartre and Pigalle plus good metro connection. If you want to cook for yourself the kitchen might be kind of small.
The beds are all wide enough for two people and the house is old but charming."
29435819,363235694,2018-12-28,171169307,LaToya,Lovely home  a great location.  I wish we had stayed there even longer. If I return to Paris I will remember this space.

80260,195086999,2017-09-18,13616939,Hien,"The bathroom has been renovated which was a pleasant surprise. 
We had trouble with the door lock but our hosts were more than happy to show us how to use it. 
The studio itself is cosy however it is perfect if you are only using it to sleep and bathe. I don't mind the cosiness at all! 
The location is not far from Pyrenees and Jourdain. It is in a diverse location. The park at the top end of the street provides a wonderful view. 
It is easy to access this place from Charles de Gaulle Airport; just be ready for the multiplie flight of stairs at the stations. 
There was a local bric-a-brac market on the Sunday that I was there. Lovely to see a less tourist filled side of Paris!"

celui de Juliette et Ivan était la juste mesure pour 9 personnes. Tout marchait bien et tout était propre. Le quartier n'est pas chique mais parfaitement calme et bien servit para le Metro. Le canal tout prés aurait été une belle promenade si le temps l'aurait permit. Merci pour la génerostié de Juliette dans le frigo dans le temps mit pour faire la facture et l'accueil si chaleureux. "
1829746,18686859,2014-08-30,13274303,Rebecca,Khal has a small but lovely apartment in a great central location of Paris. He is super nice and was there to meet me when I arrived and helped me  get settled. The bed was quite comfortable and the room is the perfect size for 1 person traveling. He even made me coffee in the morning! The apartment is also next to 2 subway stops and a Monoprix which was convenient.

32057469,512210089,2019-08-18,264537960,Travis,This place is 100% one of the best places I’ve ever booked with Airbnb. 24/7 service so came in handy when my flight landed late at night. Metro is 5 steps away from the entrance. Breakfast buffet was super reasonable. Thank you to the entire team at Hotel Tilde!
6953681,203466266,2017-10-15,33124682,Somer,Pascaline’s home was so beautiful and she was so warm and welcoming even if we weren’t able to formally meet. She is so kind and emailed us a ton of recommendations which was very helpful her home was everything you could hope for when in Paris and communicating was very thorough and easy. Her home is 10 minutes away walking to/from the Eiffel Tower and in such a beautiful part of town. The home was absolutely stunning and makes for the perfect French experience!
314294,218188957,2017-12-11,51107636,Yanell,Carole gave us a very warm welcoming and gave us many tips on restaurants / bakeries in the area. Carole’s place is small but very functional. The shower has amazing water pressure and very hot water. Carole’s place is very close to a metro stop making it very easy to get anywhere in the city.

À un jet de pierre du luxembourg et quelques pas de Saint Germain il est le repère idéal des amoureux de la rive gauche. La chambre est très confortable et la cuisine toute petite certes mais chaleureuse.
13162125,188057404,2017-08-28,66759614,Sylvie,Pour une deuxième fois en moins de six mois nous avons logé à l'appartement de Diana et en sommes revenus aussi heureux et satisfaits que la première fois.  L'appartement est très bien situé facile d'accès propre et très bien équipé.  Diana est hyper disponible et serviable.  Je recommande sans aucune hésitation! Nous espérons y retourner bientôt.
1724490,33437067,2015-05-28,29942433,Jed,This was a great apartment! This was the perfect size for 6 people. It is conveniently located very close to a metro stop making all of Paris easily accessible. The apartment was very clean. The neighborhood is nice and safe however it's not the sort of neighborhood where you can step out of your door and have lots of cafes and shopping options available.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for an affordable comfortable place to stay and doesn't mind taking the metro to get to the more upscale or shopping neighborhoods of Paris.
13946304,408373114,2019-02-04,80566953,Linda,"Localização ótima no centro de paris com bastante vida noturna. Pertinho do Louvre Notre Dame e do Pompidou nem precisamos usar o transporte público pra maior parte das atrações. 
A recepção foi ótima não pude fazer check-in no horário combinado pois tive que ficar no hospital e a equipe foi muito atenciosa ao meu problema e me receberam no dia seguinte no horário que cheguei em Paris.
O apartamento estava muito limpo e organizado achei que seria menor devido a alguns comentários que vi mas superou minhas expectativas. A cozinha é bem equipada usamos bastante fogão e forno funciona perfeitamente pra quem tem o objetivo de cozinhar. 
O banheiro é muito bom e tem um varal aquecido pra secar as toalhas e algumas roupas.
O sofá cama é bem confortável e grande e o aquecimento central funciona muito bem. Também tem aquecedores móveis para o caso de muito frio mas não precisamos usar.
Recomendo a hospedagem!"

Nino is not in Paris when we arrived however with the very detailed information provided like which bus to use which metro line to use which exit to use and etc we managed to go inside the apartment without much issues.

The apartment is at the great location just 5 minutes walk from the Trocadero Metro station.  Along the way you can find supermarket restaurants and bakery.
To see the Eiffel Tower just need 7 minutes walk.
By 20 minutes walk you can reach Arch of Triumph.  
I really suggest to walk in Paris instead of using Metro if your destination is not too far away.

We feel safe in this area and the neighbours are very friendly and helpful.

The apartment is well equipped.  Kitchen washing machine fridge and etc.
It really make us felt that we are staying at 'Home'.

There is no aircond and fan but we didn't feel hot at all even we stayed in July.

Only thing can comment is at night living room is too dark for me (not enough Lamp) hardly to read book in living room.

Overall we really love Nino's apartment we really enjoyed our stay.
By the way the building manager has a very cute little dog she always ran towards us and ran around us when we back to 'Home' and this really warm and make us feel like this is really our Home in Paris :)

Highly recommend this apartment to those who like the Home feel in Paris :)"

2029559,457959253,2019-05-25,177916865,Colin,Look no further for a comfortable clean welcoming apartment for your family in gorgeous Montmartre. Can’t beat the price for the location and gorgeous setting. Close to shops restaurants and metro. Our family of 6 was very comfortable in the apartments but we could have easily accommodated more. If you’re lucky enough to see that this is available for your trip to Paris don’t hesitate to make your reservation. Absolutely lovely place and friendly people easy communication etc.

8939397,79195426,2016-06-11,33122040,Joseph,"Marty and Philippe were the most gracious of hosts. We initially had a different Airbnb booking which cancelled on us 3 days before our arrival due to flooding in Paris. Marty accommodated us within 1 day of contacting him. He even let us stay until our departure day even though he had another guest coming the same day! He called for us an exceptional taxi with the best deal he could find and let us stay while he cleaned the apartment for the new guests.

The apartment is SPOTLESS and BEAUTIFUL. And don't get me started on the unobstructed huge view of the EIFFEL TOWER which can be seen from his amazing garden/ deck that can easily accommodate a party of 6-8 people. The bathrooms bedrooms living room and kitchen are modern artsy and homey! 

I would highly recommend staying at Marty's Airbnb as he made it feel like home for us and was like a big brother taking care of any issues or questions we had with a smile and laugh on his face!!

We will miss you Marty and Phillipe! Thankyou for a great stay! "

The apartment exceeded our expectations even though we knew it would be beautiful...exquisite in every way. Gregory and Berndt are the perfect hosts and we felt so comfortable in their home with them. 
The apartment is just a 5 minute walk from the metro and one stop from Gare du More so perfect for a Eurostar visit. The area is a mix of cosmopolitan and chic - 10 minutes walk to Sacre Coeur Monmartre and Pigale (moulin rouge etc) and a leisurely 30 minutes to Note Dame and the left bank.....you can probably tell....we rather liked staying at La Chamber Parisienne and can't think of anywhere else we rather stay in Paris!

8493058,519380953,2019-08-28,105289752,Alex,"Constance & Emmanuel's was an excellent place to spend some time exploring Paris.  It is in a good area located very close to two Metro lines.  There are plenty of restaurants and bistros within walking distance; not to mention the Chocolate Museum (definitely visit!).

The apartment itself was very clean and nicely appointed.  The large kids room (with huge bunk bed) has plenty of toys to keep kids entertained when you're not out and about.  The kitchen is well equipped.

Whilst there is a washing machine there is no dryer.  However a larger clothes hanger is provided.

The main bed is elevated (as you can see in the pictures) but the ladder is quite steep so people with mobility issues may have problems there.  Likewise the stairs of the building itself are also steep - and with no elevator - heavy bags and/or mobility issues may be a issue.

Finally the noise from the bar downstairs on the street is very loud in the evenings.  With the windows closed there is no problem.  But if its hot and you need the windows open for air flow it is very loud.

We really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again."

Walking distance to many of the sights restaurants and shops so perfect for a holiday or business trip. The communication was easy very straight forward check-in process. One word of warning if you are not great by foot the stairs up to the 5th floor might be a challenge for you. I loved the view over the roofs of Paris.

22857395,250515586,2018-04-05,2999021,Katerina,It is a wonderful artistic space in the lovely part of Paris. The apartment offers a nice escape from the city buzz. Often you do not know what to do  to stay in and explore this space or venture out into the streets of Paris. Both are enticing. You feel really at home in Julieta's place. It is a wonderful way to see Paris from the inside.
7245152,364176446,2018-12-30,37082550,Manon,Logement situé dans un quartier très calme de Paris avec une ambiance chaleureuse. Le quartier est bien desservi. Le logement en lui-même est parfait pour un couple avec enfants. A noter si vous êtes trois adultes : l’un des lits est un lit d’enfant donc un peu étroit pour une personne de grande taille. Christelle nous a fourni de très nombreuses adresses de qualité dans les environs et a été très réactive et agréable quand nous avons eu besoin d’elle. La déco est soignée et authentique. A recommander sans hésiter!

If you miss something the shop is just 2 minutes away and you're next to the canal where is a lot of places to have food. Transport links are just great you have metro and bus like 1 min away from your house. Also the flat is very quiet. if you're just two of you its perfect! Enjoyed staying there. And Thierry was very helpful and responsive to messages.

It's huge and more than comfortable for two couples: two separate bedrooms two couches large dining tables in both the living and kitchen areas. The beds are comfortable and we so enjoyed the quiet afforded by the fact that all sides of the apartment face a lovely peaceful courtyard. 

The apartment was well stocked with essentials. The separate washer and dryer make this an ideal temporary home. 

While we didn't meet Angie her assistant Stephen was very helpful showing us how everything worked making restaurant recommendations and directing us to the local supermarket.

We were very pleased with our stay here."

De communicatie met de gastvrouw  de entree en het uitzicht op de sacre coeur was heel goed. De kamer was smoezelig en oud. Wanneer het een likje verf krijgt en  het een nieuw keukenblokje geeft is de kamer voor een single reiziger low budget is deze kamer misschien prima niet voor koppels die een romantisch weekendje Parijs voor ogen hebben."

All the help we needed when it came to breakfast place and a forgotten bag. We stayed only 1 night (a family of five) - might have been too small for us for a longer stay...

4440379,27035608,2015-02-23,22168022,Gaby,"Josephine appartment was very nice and cozy. We felt just like home. Everything was nice and neat. It is such a cute and lovely place i would come back if it is possible. The location is nice too next to the train station next to restaurants and a bakery. The only thing is that it isn't really free parking. There are many parking places available but all says""payant"". But overall we had a great stay! Josephine is also very fast in responding and very helpfull. Thank you Josephine!"
20950197,196902251,2017-09-24,4608802,Antonio,"This place is in great location in Saint Germain.
The apartmemt has 2 double bedrooms on double bedroom with also an additional spare bed and a sofa bed. So it works well for 8 people + a kid.
Beds are the 140cm wide size.
The apartment has a very efficient internal clima system very quiet and perfect for air change/circulation (one window cannot be open and one bedroom doesn't have window but with this internal ventilation system you always have good fresh air).
The apartment isn't facing the main road so it is very quiet (you'll sleep veey well!).

It's very well furnished cosy and colourful.

I'd definitely recommend this place and Mai Anh has been helpful and very nice host."

14366454,504170188,2019-08-07,159095523,Renee,Unfortunately the worst experience I had with Airbnb so far. Arriving to a very dirty room giving me no choice but to change Airbnb instantly.  Host tried to tell me it was cleaned in advance and was rude enough to claim I was lying. This despite all the photos taken of the dirty floor bed book shelf etc minutes after stepping my foot inside. My whole day went away cause of this mess so it was a very unpleasant experience . Also the room in my opinion is way to expensive considering the super tiny space you got that has shared bathroom and toilet. For the first time I will not recommend this appartement.
9688429,191574146,2017-09-08,58377461,Felix,Nice people and a very nice room!

Nice and safe building fantastic location because not too toutisty and easy metro access. Parc des Buttes Chaumont is just peaceful and beautiful: perfect for a morning jog.
It was very easy and quick to communicate with Florence.
I highly recommend this place."
3252171,81760513,2016-06-24,4481069,KwangSoon,"I haven't seen Ana maria the number of host wasn't hers it was violetta's. The 1st day when we arrive the person who welcomed us wasn't Anna maria neither Violetta  it was 3rd person. 
I wanted to ask question about adjustement and extension but this person called violetta was very very aggressive. I wanted to talk with Ana Maria but she never gave her real phone number. 
District is near the garde du lyon convinient. But it's near the big hospital so there are many ambulances pass in the night. Plus the day we have arrived there was music festival on the street we couldn't sleep the windows are not good for protect the noise. 
The key is not easy to use. The neighbor there is a gardien she looked us very stragely I felt like an unwelcome guest.
This house has 2 rooms and a sofa bed enough for 5 person but still it's expensive. The decoration is kind of classic but groomy the air is humid after shower."
17522117,431544905,2019-04-01,219437065,Therese,Beautiful well kept home centrally located.  Easy access to the Metro.  Many restaurants and a grocery nearby.

Everything in the apartment was in very good condition. We liked the neighborhood very eclectic mix of people. Just a few blocks from the metro. Nearby the canal for walks and restaurants. We found it a great area not a tourist neighborhood. Very secure building we felt quite safe. Apartment had wifi which was helpful because we could not find a lot of free wifi in paris. We highly recommend apartment and Lucas!

440466,8029372,2013-10-13,8857626,Jana,This was my first AirBnB experience so I was skeptical going into it and very pleased coming out of it. Talia was not only very kind but generous as well. My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights at her apartment which was perfectly located for us near the eiffel tower and it was just as she advertised. No hidden surprises.  We had to check out of her place by noon on our last day but Talia allowed us to leave our luggage at her parents apartment very near by as we were not departing Paris until evening.  This was HUGE help to us and was greatly appreciated. I would recommend her place to any couple staying in Paris. The bed is extremely comfortable the apartment is cozy the location is lovely and we truly enjoyed our stay.

3353321,43483071,2015-08-20,32131679,Emily,Francois was a wonderful host - he was very responsive to numerous emails over a period of a few months after we had made a reservation. He also remained in touch during our week-long stay in his beautiful charming apartment. We were three single women in our early 30's and we found the apartment perfect. 2 of us shared the bedroom while the third slept in the living room on the convertible sofabed. A highlight for us was the lovely August breeze that came in through the big windows which themselves offer a view over a tree-lined street and north for a glimpse of Sacre  Coeur. The neighborhood was walkable to almost everywhere in Paris we wanted to go. I would absolutely stay here again.
32659626,468755060,2019-06-13,76664665,Yongmoon,Very close to Eiffel tower and Metro.  Supermarket is in 5min walking distance. Facility is clean and cosy. Immediate response on bath tub issue.  My family enjoyed 7 days staying at Mr. Rod’s.

6359154,145072397,2017-04-17,11459211,Josh,Guillaume could teach a class on how to be an excellent host. He is incredibly helpful and communicative at every step of the process including sending detailed check-in information and neighborhood recommendations a couple of weeks before the trip. His place is modern but also very comfortable and couldn't be better located. I would be lucky to be able to stay at Guillaume's place again for my next trip to Paris!

48592,536596839,2019-09-27,237657851,Francois,Très bien situé et calme MAIS la propreté laissant grandement à désirer.  Salle de bain avec forte odeur d’urine douche avec présence de moisissure armoire et poignées d’armoires graisseuses interrupteur très sale. Nous avons dû acheter produits et linges de nettoyage et consacrer quelques heures de nos vacances. Lave vaisselle non fonctionnelle même après avoir averti l’hôte la demande a été ignorée.  Nous avons attendus plus de 45 minutes sur le trottoir parce que l’hôte était en retard à notre arrivé.
13074447,480642583,2019-07-03,2829580,Kanan,Michaels apartment was great. We could walk around everywhere and the metro was also just 2 mins away! I would highly recommend
75709,10408774,2014-02-17,12117977,Phoebe,Marie-Christine was incredible. She made an amazing breakfast and really made my friend and I feel at home. I am a student in Paris and really enjoyed the opportunity to live in another arrondissement and get Marie-Christine's expertise on the Marais. It was all very enriching and I highly recommend her place to anyone. 
12235777,337020120,2018-10-15,134832788,Una,We had a great time in Damien’s place! The balcony had wonderful view. The toilets and bathroom is not in the room but it is not a problem. Also Damien responded to me rapid once I had questions. Highly recommend to couple!
19261293,336396603,2018-10-14,211905905,Iza,We had a great time at Yilu’s place. The location of the apartment is outstanding it is within walking distance from places such as the Louvre there are several shops and many restaurants around. Yilu gave us some general directions as well as advice about places worth seeing. Overall she is a very communicative and easygoing host. The room is not very spacious but it is really everything you need for two people maximum. The staircase can be challenging if you are travelling with a large piece of luggage as there is no elevator. Even though the apartment is located in the very centre of the city and the nightlife lasts until late hours you will have no problems with getting some rest because the room itself is not facing the street and it is very quiet. I can definitely recommend!
11732369,179725066,2017-08-08,79904498,Dilara,Perfect location!! The house is very clean and beautiful. The best place to stay if you wanna have a true Paris experience.

9145097,62714243,2016-02-16,50285962,Poppy,Carine's flat was lovely - exactly how it was described and very stylish. The neighbourhood is fantastic and close to the river le marais republique etc. plus it has good transport links to go further afield. Carine was a fantastic hostess - she was very organised and welcoming even though we arrived a little late thanks to Eurostar. She made lots of good recommendations about local places to try and allowed us to leave our suitcases in the apartment which was very kind. I would recommend staying here if you want a central base in Paris.
34329525,532038404,2019-09-19,82102012,Jane,Very good house in Paris. Axelle is very nice to welcome us though we check in very late at night.

8359696,227539904,2018-01-15,108820044,Hannah,My sister and I stayed in Olivier's apartment over our stay in paris . Olivier has a beautiful big apartment and we were given a cute cosy room which had a connected bathroom which we had to ourselves- this was really handy. Their apartment is in an awesome place- lots of restaurants and public transport close by which made it easy for us to travel everywhere. Olivier and his wife are genuinely lovely and warm people who made us feel very welcome. We highly recommend staying in his air bnb if you're visiting Paris.

908363,235577968,2018-02-17,88529720,Gemma,I stayed here with my boyfriend for 4 nights in February.  The apartment was easy to find- our train from the airport took us within a 5 minute walk from the apartment ( 40 mins direct journey) We were met on arrival and showed around. Very friendly and helpful host. Marie was always quick to respond to questions we had. The apartment was definitely smaller than we thought but perfect for what we needed. The only thing to note is that it is on the main road so a little noisy and the walls are very thin. We could walk almost everywhere - Notre Dame Louvre Catacombs.The Eiffel Tower was a little further. Really great restaurants and bars within walking distance too and not touristy! (past the pantheon). Overall a great stay. Thank you Marie.
595610,70548447,2016-04-18,44884546,Kerry,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and I was a bit nervous about it but found there was nothing to be concerned about.  The apartment is lovely and was great for our family of 5.  It is just as pictured. The location is ideal with a Metro stop just steps away and plenty of restaurants and bakeries nearby although the short walk to the ""Kayshin"" bakery is totally worth it (I can't remember the exact name but it is mentioned in Christine's notebook of information.) The best part though was how friendly and helpful Christine Pascal and their daughter Charlotte were.  Their assistance in scheduling a taxi to the airport was also very much appreciated. We all recommend the apartment but you'll be especially grateful about what a please it is to meet this thoughtful family. "
10555427,150754047,2017-05-09,5493793,Kate,A fantastic bijou apartment in a great central location. Lovely hosts and very good amenities. We very much enjoyed our stay.

The apartment was cozy for a family of 6 but very clean and with all necessary amenities. The host met us personally to explain how things worked which we appreciated very much. The host also responded quickly to all queries we had. All in all it was a very good Airbnb experience for us and we highly recommend Djamel's apartment!

10433014,217422703,2017-12-09,157633872,Jackson,Everything was fine except the power kept cutting out which would kill the light heat and wifi. It was easy to turn the power back on via the master master switch; however there were some nights when it kept shutting off over and over again presenting a real problem. Otherwise everything was great. Good value and a very nice location.
4069162,256670572,2018-04-23,23471868,Bianca,This apartment is in the heart of Le Marais and walkable to several attractions— the Louvre Notre Dame and Musée d’Orsay. Great for a weekend exploring this lovely neighborhood!
6343000,36104316,2015-06-25,5820372,Coline,The apartment is cosy and convenient (even with 4 flights of tiny stairs) and it is perfect for a trip to Paris for 2 . The area is safe and easy to access with public transportation. Communication with Veronique was easy and she was nice and welcoming.

Even if was not in Paris he was always sending me message and asking me if everything was going well. Definitly i will stay there in my next trip to Paris
4385903,281092452,2018-06-24,11602933,Dennis,"We travelled to Paris for my parents 50th anniversary with our family of nine and absolutely loved staying here. Plenty of room and the amenities were incredible. The neighborhood was great with many restaurants and bars within walking distance. Two great grocery stores were about a 10 minute walk away. 

An easy 15-20 minutes walk to public transportation the Notre Dame Latin Quarter St Chapelle  and the Siene."
2738610,292922184,2018-07-19,180725268,Marta,"El piso de Julia está muy bien ubicado a cinco minutos de la boca del metro con muy buenas conexiones. La calle es tranquila con supermercados y locales para comer. La Torre Effiel está a 20 minutos andando.
Aunque no vimos a Julia siempre respondió los (Hidden by Airbnb) muy rápido e intentó solucionar todo lo que le pedíamos. Nuestro avión salia mas tarde de la hora del check-out y Julia nos dejó guardar nuestras maletas mas allá de la hora. Todo un detalle."
21975804,242551427,2018-03-12,48182272,Sabine,"This is a wonderful place just like an apartment in Paris is supposed to be! filled with a splendid taste beautiful paintings and where you can feel perfectly at home in the very nice and not so touristic 11 th. arrondissement. Here you can mingle with locals and find so many good shops bars restaurants all just a stroll away round rue de roquette. Whenever I will go back to Paris I will try to rent this place again.
The only tiny disadvantage could be that the sleeping-room to the front goes out directly to the Place Leon Blum so for light sleepers traffic-noise could be a problem. Luckily I had the sleeping-room at the court and slept very well.
All the communication with Chantal and her renting-agency went perfectly well we had a really good time and I can definitely recommend this place."
9991670,445438572,2019-04-29,146389236,Gary,The room is good that it has a fridge and microwave and the bathroom and toilet is opposite so it allows you to be self sufficient . The apartment block is also a good location being on a square that has markets ever two or so days. The Metro is close by and it only takes about 20 to 30 minutes to get to the tourist areas of Paris. There are also many cafes and a good supermarket close by.
192162,24804708,2015-01-03,452836,Pamela,This was our second time staying at Cristina and Matteo's studio and we loved every second of it. The studio is SUPER central to the metro bus restaurants and all the sights of Paris ( you're about 4-5 blocks from Norte Dame and the Shakespeare bookstore. Our first time there was no lift and we didn't mind the 5th floor walk up. This time there was one and it made things even better which is hard to top because everything is perfect. You have everything you need in the studio including delicious nespresso coffee which they provide samples of and both the shower and toilets are comfy for anyone to use ( this coming from a 24 week pregnant person who is always uncomfortable these days). Overall our stay was amazing as it was the first time we stayed in 2013 and we'd totally stay again. Do yourselves a favor and book them as they fill fast :-)

Mit der Küche wäre selbst ein professioneller Koch zufrieden. Wir haben uns in der Wohnung absolut wohl und sicher gefühlt. 
Veronique ist eine unglaublich zuvorkommende und aufmerksame Gastgeberin. Der Kontakt verlief reibungslos. 
Sollte ich wieder nach Paris kommen wäre diese Wohnung meine erste Wahl.

16063391,445831633,2019-04-30,237685870,Abby,We absolutely loved our stay in Bastille for the week! April in Paris was a treat and it was even better on Christian's blooming terrace. The location is great and next to 2 metros which can get you anywhere in Paris within 20-30 minutes. It is tucked away from the tourist traps and helps you experience France more authentically. Close to lots of cute shops markets and many restaurants! The bed was comfortable the place is bright and welcoming. Consider yourself lucky if this place is available on your trip to Paris!

5409220,161659531,2017-06-18,131346733,Laura,"Design lovers will adore this quiet apartment located in a former atelier (workshop/store) on one of the oldest streets in Paris. Its previous use is still felt in the fixtures and the elegantly rustic attention to detail. 

Stephane and his wife have woven so much personality into the small touches throughout - the ceramic stars in the polished concrete floor were my favorite. It made for a truly special place to stay while experiencing a wonderful neighborhood in a beautiful city.

The space is well appointed with carefully chosen furnishings and just enough of everything for 1-2 people to stay for a few days. My husband and I spent most of our time out exploring and the ""atelier"" was a lovely spot to come home each night."

We ate out most of the time so the apartment had everything we needed it was tidy as well.

The Ecole Militaire is a short walk away as is the nearest Carrefour and the Eiffel tower is 15 minutes on foot as well."

Abbiamo trovato l'appartamento con copriletto macchiato stoviglie sporche e mancavano gli asciugamani. Inoltre le scale per raggiungere l'appartamento sono abbastanza pericolose. Lucas disponibile fino ad un certo punto. Non ha fatto nulla per venirci incontro per check-in/out e per procurarci gli asciugamani che mancavano.

14401181,314638116,2018-08-27,206880558,Maud,We stayed at Francis’ apartment for a long weekend and it was perfect. Not too many steps and in the back of the building. It was quiet but still in the middle of a great neighborhood with lots of bars and restaurants ! The space feels roomy for the center of Paris and is lovingly decorated making us feel right at home. Having the bedroom separated from the living room was a real luxury. It was great to hang out on the couch after walking around all day. The kitchen has all the appliances you need to enjoy (Email hidden by Airbnb) municating with Francis was quick and simple; I would definitely book here again!

There are several bistros/bars nearby but with the Metro station being a 3 minute walk away you can quickly get just about anywhere in Paris. We had a little trouble figuring out how to get inside the gate and how to contact Deliah (she does not speak much English) but eventually a nice man got us our keys and showed us the apartment despite the language barrier. Other than that our stay was great! Would recommend!

177838,26245637,2015-02-08,17352158,Tony,"Perfect!  On our previous visits to Paris we had stayed in the neighbourhood (hotels on Rue des Ecoles) but as we had our adult daughter with us on this visit we needed something larger and Genevieve's apartment was the ideal solution - enough space for the three of us and in an area we know.

Genevieve and Benedicte could not have been more welcoming and the apartment was excellent - everything the listing and the photographs suggested. Being next door to an Eric Kayser boulangerie was a treat and we will miss our morning trip downstairs for a baguette croissants and a pain au chocolate. With a metro station just around the corner and plenty of shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood the location is ideal and close to many of the main sights in Paris. It really could not be better and we would be delighted to be able to stay here again. Thank you! Merci beaucoup!"

The home is lovely with beautiful high ceilings and the living room faces a park.  The apartment is located across the street from a park and there are food shops and many restaurants near by

24983710,548221266,2019-10-17,19522008,Steven,The studio apartment is in a great part of the city with several good boulangeries food stores and restaurants as well as museums within walking distance. The main room is  of comfortable size particularly when the sleep sofa is closed and the mattress is comfortable. Also there is good though somewhat complicated security in the form of several doors with codes fobs or keys to enter and there is an elevator. The biggest downside is a very small bathroom. The kitchen is small but usable though I did not use it.
35964368,524173100,2019-09-05,34331904,Marion,"Great location easy to access the apartment. Close to all transport. Access to supermarket and restaurants and cafe’s. 
Great view as advertised. 

The apartment itself was very spartan. There was 1 complimentary coffee pod. There were no basics in the kitchen such as salt nor was there any soap in the bathroom. Some of the cleaning could have been improved upon but all in all a pleasant stay."

1264009,507976004,2019-08-12,71873477,Angela,Eric’s place was absolutely perfect. Not only did he meet us at a much earlier time for our check in day but he stayed and showed us around his beautiful flat and made us feel very comfortable. The balcony was wonderful. I used it every day. The place was clean and close to public transport with a lot of great bakeries and restaurant options nearby . I would highly recommend this home especially if you want an authentic Parisian experience! Thank you Eric!
437586,29266113,2015-04-06,26783954,Regina,Wir wurden von einem jungen Verwandten von Max sehr herzlich willkommen geheißen. Das Apartment liegt im Herzen von Paris sobald man das Eingangstor zum Hof verlässt ist man mitten drin im Weltstadttrubel und trotzdem ist es relativ ruhig da im Hinterhof gelegen. Die Dusche ist sehr klein und beengt und nur durch 2 Vorhänge in der Toilette definiert. Da es dort kein Fenster gibt und nur eine Lüftung bröckelt die Farbe an der Decke ab und auch die Fliesen haben schon gelitten. Ansonsten ist der Wohnraum sehr freundlich gestaltet und wir haben uns wohl gefühlt. Wer nicht selbst kochen möchte findet genügend Möglichkeiten in der unmittelbaren Umgebung. 
4599794,199898432,2017-10-03,7185856,Bill,Great location. Good communication with Corine who was very helpful throughout our stay. Great light in the apartment which was very quiet. Proximity to groceries a wide variety of eating options and public transport made staying here very easy.  Would definitely stay here again on a future visit. Merci Corine!

J'ai passé la nuit chez Axel et j'étais très bien accueilli. En fait j'avais changé ma réservation à la dernière minute mais il n'avait pas de problème. L'appartement était très confortable et propre. La petite rue où se situe l'appartement est très calme parfait pour bien dormir mais le lieu autour de l'appartement est très amusant avec beaucoup de bars et de cafés.  C'était dommage que j'ai passé juste une nuit.

Axel was a great host and very accommodating to a last minute change in plans.  The apartment was clean and very nice comfortably accommodating two people.  The little street that the apartment is on is very calm and quiet but the area around where the apartment is located is poppin' with a lot of bars and cafes nearby. Overall it was great and I wish that I could have stayed there longer "
12154695,448613196,2019-05-05,225222347,Emanuela,It's a wonderful apartment just like the description with everything you need in it.  Also the area is very good for a few days in Paris with many shops around and very close to several metro stations you can easily visit Paris.  Although I did not know her personally communicating with Mathilde was very good is a great host I recommend it
26033036,318636608,2018-09-04,206300463,Johanne,"Nous avons beaucoup apprécié l'appartement de Chantal car idéalement situé lumineux et plutôt spacieux à l'exception de la salle de bain plutôt minimaliste 

Les indications pour prendre possession de l'appartement étaient claires et précises.

Nous ne regrettons pas notre choix et avons pu explorer Paris pendant  une semaine.

Nous recommandons sans hésiter"
11517583,362453127,2018-12-26,1540747,Gilbert,Beautiful well appointed apartment in my favourite part of town. Plenty of restaurants and cafés nearby and close to 2 metro stations when you want to explore further.
26172109,333437164,2018-10-07,170774117,Dorte,Very nice apartment in quiet but nice area. Some nice cafes close to the Metro Convention.  Host Etienne very pleasant to communicate with. Nice balcony.

We are a small family of three (a mum with two kids of 15 and 13 years old) .
We stayed in Paris for 11 days. 
The apartment is what you call ""home_away from_home"" spacious and clean .
It is well equiped :all the basics needed for cooking cleaning up and washing.
The two bedrooms dining room and large comfy living room made it the perfect place.The whole apartment is bright homy and comfortable.
The Wifi was excellent and
the location perfectat a walking distance to everything: subways bus stations  restaurants cafes and markets and just facing  le jardin du Luxembourg
I would highly recommend the apartment specialy for being able to come back safely from a night out to relax in a place I could feel 'my own' during my stay in Paris. I can't wait to return."
27444854,417406979,2019-02-27,69971570,Lindey,Tony’s place was perfect for our needs. It was spacious with a beautiful interior and all amenities but perfect location too. Very close to multiple metros for easy access to the rest of the city but we also loved the available options nearby. There are great restaurants bakeries bars etc and a short walk to the Canal. We would stay again in a heart beat!
16268793,344307121,2018-11-03,50598564,Hermes,"El departamento tiene una ubicación privilegiada con gran cercanía al museo louvre y toda la zona turística. La residencia es muy limpia y extraordinariamente segura el unico detalle seria el tamaño del loft ya que si es pequeño apenas suficiente para 2 personas.

El anfitrión muy amable abierto a ayudar con horarios de salida o entrada complicados dentro de lo posible y con respuestas muy rápidas ante cualquier duda."
35399335,556662876,2019-10-30,7096448,Barbara,Aileu's apartment was as described online with the exception of the bathrooms. Instead of two full bathrooms which would include a toilet there were 2 “salle de bains” and a single separate toilet. The kitchen perhaps needed some oversight from the cleaners: the fridge was clean but had a few food items from previous guests damp towels were left in washer. The apartment had a nice feel to it and was in a good building. The neighborhood was safe and metro was five minutes away. Alieu and cohost were exceptional communicators--quick to response and helpful.

29230476,406033316,2019-01-28,155345311,Ivana,I really enjoyed my stay at Martin’s place. It is a very nice apartment with a good and calm location close to all necessary points like shops or metro stops. The apartment is well equipped and fully furnished. It seems new and chic. I would recommend it also to those that do not have problems with stairs as it on the 6th floor. But you can enjoy more sunshine and vue over the roofs.
2298063,14120148,2014-06-12,9189566,Ruth,Studio Luxembourg was exactly how we expected it to be - clean comfortable and in an amazing location. And Bastien's communication was fantastic throughout the booking process and during our stay too. Definitely somewhere I'd stay again and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others.

263044,535827809,2019-09-25,206968936,Liz,The highlight of the apartment was the windows.  Tall windows that open up to the train station plaza below and let in lots of light.  We enjoyed sleeping with them open for fresh air and to hear the city sounds but when closed the windows were well insulated and blocked sound.  Totally what I was hoping for when staying in Paris.  The bed was comfortable and the apartment was certainly large enough for two people.  There was a Metro station in close proximity and were were able to find plenty of restaurants in the area.
3349708,535720631,2019-09-25,153213898,Malory,"El alojamiento de Bertrand fue estupendo se adaptaron en todo momento a nuestras necesidades y se portaron muy bien el apartamento está muy bien situado la parada de metro estaba a menos de 10’ la zona era preciosa y muy segura teníamos supermercados a nuestro alcance paradas de bus etc. 
La parada del orlybus estaba solo a 9 minutos andando con lo que estaba muy bien comunicado con el aeropuerto tenerlo en cuenta cuando llegueis porque yo pague un taxi y con el bus era suficiente y más barato claro. 
Tengo que decir que Bertrand fue un anfitrión inmejorable respondía a nuestras dudas y se portó muy bien aunque no llegue a conocerlo en persona.   Lo recomiendo 100% si queréis visitar Paris porque yo conocía nada de esta ciudad y el taxista me dijo que la zona era muy buena y por las noches nos movíamos con mucha tranquilidad."
14001487,99052555,2016-09-03,91026298,Anne,"Well apparently I am the first one at that place. Sure I myself hesitated to take it since there were no reviews but I am so glad I took the ""risk"". It was great. So quite briefly:
Very nice flat bright and spacious with a beautiful panoramic view on Paris from the Tour Eiffel to Montmartre (really! Youl'll see that at sunset WOW! it is better than the pics). The dupleix is very convenient: the top floor with the terrace for the everyday life the bottom floor (10th so you have also a view) for the sleeping and working (if you have to ...). Every thing (wifi dishwasher washingmachine) is OK and you can enjoy the terrace for reading eating etc. The two bathroom are very confortable (one tub has a jacuzzi function) and the two beds are large queen-size. The decoration is very very lovely: old furniture contemporary paintings (and plenty of books!).
The area around is secure and very pleasant: organic-foodmarket just down the building the very famous marché d'Aligre at ten minutes walk and many small supermarkets open until 9 pm nearby and also french café and a very good bakery. So you really experience the real Paris. Many  good French and Asian restaurants in the area as far as I saw thru the number of their guests. You can reach the center of Paris (the Marais The Louvre ..)  very easily by bus (one line just in the street) by the subway or the velib (self rental bikes system).
Olivier left many indications to facilitate my stay in the flat and in Paris which was very nice from him. There was no problem to get and leave the keys. 
A wonderful stay in Paris thanks to a wonderful flat. I would surely come back there in my next stay."
21711728,257670600,2018-04-27,34294214,Anne,Nous avons été très très bien accueillis par Marcelle malgré notre horaire d'arrivée reporté. Nous avons eu toutes les explications nécessaires pour notre séjour. C'est une hôtesse que je recommande vivement. L'appartement est joli pratique et très bien situé près des transports et commerces. Belle vue sur la tour Eiffel surtout la nuit. Par beau temps le soleil y entre matin et soir. Excellent séjour.
3299735,512087740,2019-08-18,163630312,Lokha,location est superbe bonne restaurant autour. L’apt est grand mais seulement avoir une petite toilette il y a les espaces qu’on ne peux pas utiliser c’est mieux de le prevenir. C’est un apt de famille pleins de affaires dedans n’espère pas une expérience de séjours comme dans un hotel pro.
6235591,534748218,2019-09-23,3749150,Martina & Peter,Francoise“ place is in an excellent and enjoyable location. From the apartment you have a view directly to the old amphittheatre which is still used by the Parisians for playing boules and soccer. It is a green and pleasantly quiet area although perfect to reach the sites you might usually want to see while in Paris. We very much appreciated the very well equipped kitchen (incl. dishwasher) and that the house has an elevator which is not very common for old buildings in Paris. The apartment is spacious very well maintained spotlessly clean - everything you need for a relaxed stay. Francoise was supereasy to communicate with and very flexible with our arrival time as we came earlier as expected. All in all: highly recommended and would stay there again.
2330539,326043616,2018-09-21,1089503,Naomi,We loved our stay in Pina's apartment and the location was fantastic - just steps from the metro station and with views across to Sacre Coeur in one direction and the Eiffel Tower in the other.
6380262,137896284,2017-03-18,35740168,Yashwanth,Anna is such a generous host. She went out of the way to accommodate our early check-in. It's a cute and clean place close to Eiffel tower (less than 5 min walk) and other metro stops. This gave us an opportunity to catch the beauty of eiffel tower in our several trips there. Our communication and instructions were spot on from the time of our booking to the end of our stay. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. 
37586562,551351316,2019-10-20,245074900,Moritz,Very lovely flat. 1min away from Metro 'Jaurès' wich connects you to amywhere in Paris. Very calm and quiet. There is a balcony. There is no WLAN. You can not close the window completly and it can maybe get a little bit cold in the night.
728396,19813918,2014-09-19,13655891,Alexa,The apartment was perfect - just the right size for a couple. The neighbourhood was AMAZING. So many cafes and bars and beautiful boulangeries and patisseries. Truly the perfect neighbourhood to vacation. It was a short 15 minute walk to Marais and the Seine too. Kristin was extremely helpful with all of my endless questions too!
17728662,472226032,2019-06-19,41375113,Jason,This is a fantastically located apartment just steps from Pont Neuf the RER great cafes the Latin Quarter and so much more that central Paris has to offer. There are significant stairs (it is on the 5th floor) but once inside you can enjoy a partial view of the Eiffel Tower. Tres bien!

7720770,127446680,2017-01-18,89035862,Kristen,I needed a place to stay for one night on short notice and Roman confirmed my booking in only about an hour! It was very centrally located to shops transit the Luxembourg Gardens and many restaurants and food stores. The street and neighborhood was quiet at night but I felt safe and walked to the shops and a restaurant for dinner no problem. The building is nice and secure as there are two codes to get in. Roman had someone in the building who let me in and showed me how to use the TV etc. The apartment itself is small but as I was alone it was fine for my stay. There is wifi and cable and the kitchen has the basics you would need. The only issue I found was minor there was no soap in the bathroom or kitchen and the sink in the bathroom had trouble draining but it was all fairly clean and I was very comfortable during my stay. Would definitely recommend!

12977486,199844261,2017-10-03,7347269,Giulia Andrea,Lo studio di Sophie è molto carino situato a 5 minuti a piedi da Place Vendome quindi in pieno centro. Lo studio é davvero piccolo ma ha tutto questo di cui potete avere bisogno. C’e anche una specie di cucinotto non molto grande ma funzionale con anche il microonde e il bollitore. Il letto è un divano letto ma comodo. La doccia é in camera ma il bagno si trova nel corridoio (è di utilizzo comune). In generale ci siamo trovati molto bene e lo consiglieremmo anche perché il rapporto qualità/prezzo è sicuramente ottimo!

It would be a shame to miss out on not only the house and unique garden top but Segloenes hospitality. The bed was very comfortable the automatic blackout curtains were great and the bath was a nice amenity to have the option of after a long day of walking all over Paris. Check in was easy as she was very flexible. The breakfast every morning was great too! Segolene also gave us access to many guide books and maps as well as her own personal local knowledge. I would highly recommend booking!

2826708,29155718,2015-04-05,22957588,Stacey,Ariane was a wonderful hostess! She was very flexible with allowing us to drop off our luggage before official check in time. The apartment is small but very comfortable. It is perfect for two or three people. It is close to the metro and within walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe. I would definitely stay there again! The only downside for us was that we were non-smokers and the guests right before us were heavy smokers but we chose to stay there so that's on us. 
26885375,344352239,2018-11-03,13977241,Kory,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights/5 days. Overall the apartment was in a great area and in good condition but the stay was made difficult by the lack of amenities provided. I would NOT stay here until the host can resolve some of the issues. (or at max stay for a single night or two.)

First the good:
- This apartment is very close to the metro and other shops. Great location.
- The apartment was large for Paris and the bed was very comfy.
- The room was clean.
- We got a lot of exercise due to the apartment being on the 5th floor without an elevator.

The negatives:
- Only one key given to guests.
- There is no iron or steamer in the apartment. (A total no-brainer to have in Paris. Everyone dresses up. I had to get my dress shirts professionally pressed).
- No hand soap in the bathroom and kitchen. We ended up using dish soap to wash our hands (which had almost run out too).
- Empty paper towel holder. No paper towels available.
- Guests are issued a single hand towel and a shower towel. There are NO ADDITIONAL towels available. This was definitely inadequate for a 4-day stay. Our towels were gross! There were no facial towels available - so it was challenging to wash our faces.
- Door handle on the bedroom had fallen off the door before we got there. No way to close the bedroom door.
- Bring your own coffee - the room is equipped with a Nespresso but there were only two knockoff nespresso pods there when we arrived.
- No salt/pepper/oil in the kitchen. You will need to bring everything.
- The wifi was unreliable and slow. It kept disconnecting for us the entire time.
- Finally the bathroom window has no covering or privacy for when you are showering. This did not really bother us but if you mind flashing the neighbors it will likely bother you."
2267326,82333730,2016-06-27,17327844,Yurina,The studio is lovelystylish and cleanalso it's very close to Metroso it was easy to go anywhere. There are cafesrestaurants and some shops around thereso you wouldn't feel inconvenient at all. I really really like her studio!!

clean tastefully appointed and actually quite beautiful.  What more could one want?
My only regret in writing this review is that it may be too fully booked in the future for us to stay there again."

The location was very close to st Michel - Notre Dame metro station so was easy to reach many Paris destinations as well as local bus routes.

The apartment was an on upper floor (with lift) and had a great view of the Eiffel Tower  especially charming during the evening. 

Communications were excellent and check in was very convenient and helpful. We had a small issue during our stay and the host was very responsive.

Highly recommended."

15778909,159269789,2017-06-10,122268996,Tommy,Cindy and Nicolas were great hosts. Check-in and check-out went smoothly and they didn't hesitate to help us plan out a few things to visit while in the city. Location was a bit far to walk everywhere (although we did so it's manageable) however there is a metro stop nearby. The room and the entire home had a cozy feel and the cat they were cat-sitting was quite an added bonus. However the bed was a little too firm for my liking and be careful when getting a shower as the hot water runs out rather quickly. Besides the three things above Cindy's listing is a great place to stay and I will certainly return if I decide to stay in this area of Paris again.

9248720,525155361,2019-09-07,19265563,Karen,"What a gorgeous little hideaway! I loved Karolina’s flat. The view is wonderful with a lovely breeze through the window. As a lone traveler it was ideal. I had room for my small case at the end of the bed but a larger bag may be more difficult. The secret is to stay tidy. The bed was comfortable and I slept well on it. The bathroom is compact but as a smaller person it was fine for me. Also as much as I wanted to walk the 6 levels up and down I was lazy and very grateful for the small elevator.

The area is wonderful with a couple of metro stations nearby. Stop to watch the petanque players in the late afternoon and feel like you’re a true local! There is a small supermarket nearby as well as quite a few eateries and bars close by. They tended to party late into the night which some may find annoying. But the window can shut out a bit of the sound. I found I was so worn out from long days that I slept through most of it. 

I would stay here again for sure!"

17506699,165928522,2017-07-02,96731516,Sam,Nice view of the Eiffel Tour. Location is close to restaurants in the area and the walk up the stairs is not too bad even though it's on the 6th floor (US style counting). Communication with Pedro was a challenge (he mixed up the date on check in so we had to wait 2 hours and the friend he had helping him never responded to one of our questions) but once we were in the studio was comfortable and clean and exactly as described. Futon was comfortable for 2 people.

The Check in and check out was very easy and the communication very good with friendly people.
The flat was very clean and had a stylish athmosphere. 
It also sported free W-Lan and was fully equiped.
We just used the bed and clean but tiny bathroom but everything was available from cooking to cleaning.
We found loads of interesting books about architecture and medieval Europe though we could not read any french and had no time for reading. 
Nice clean little home would also be good for longer stays. 
In the area around are many restaurants metro pharmacy and whatever you might need."
21225643,243011518,2018-03-14,151136014,Catherine,This apartment is a great location whether you want to take the metro (around 3 minutes away) or whether you want to walk down to the main part of the city (about 40 minutes to get to the Louvre). The apartment itself is nice and cozy and allows you to have your privacy after a long day. We used the kitchen to make breakfast while we were there and everything was great. Definitely recommend if you’re wanting to stay in Paris.

I would say the flat is perfect for a couple but we were 3 and was ok.
You have the metro a few minutes away and the bus stop is just at the door.
I would recommend 100%.

Marina es encantadora contacto con nosotros nada más pisar el aeropuerto y estuvo pendiente hasta que llegamos.  Nos explico cómo movernos por Paris y nos dio muy buenos consejos.
La casa es perfecta para una pareja aunque nosotros éramos 3 y estuvimos muy cómodos. 
Localización es muy buena con el metro a unos minutos y una parada de autobús en frente del portal.
Se lo recomiendo 100%"

the appartement is not very big (as you can see on the picture) but its ok for a short stay in paris. "
1813981,29658114,2015-04-11,24105394,Ilnam,"Philippe는 일단 굉장히 친절합니다.
숙소도착전에 미리 입구에 나와서 반기고 짐을 들어주는 모습이 상당히 인상깊었습니다.

숙소도 엄청 깔끔하며 청결도가 좋습니다.
다만 아쉬운건 침대가 좀 높이 위치해있어서 잠버릇이 안좋은 사람은 낙상의 위험이 있습니다.
부엌이 상당히 작지만 있을건 다 있습니다.

위치 역시 괜찮습니다.
Les Halles 역에서 도보로 7분정도에 위치해 있으며 오페라와 루브르박물관이 상당히 근처에 있습니다. 인근에 다수의 한식당 및 일식당이 위치해있으므로 한식이 그리우실때 가볍게 가셔서 드시면 됩니다.

전체적으로 추천하는 숙소이며 다음에 가더라도 또 묵고싶은 숙소입니다."
1528100,16068299,2014-07-21,9346148,Chun On,"The location of the apartment is excellent. 
Just a few steps to the metro station Line 1. 
By Line 1 your can nearly visit most of the landmarks of Paris.

The size of the apartment is small. 
But it is still good enough for 2 persons. 
And the apartment is well-equipped.  
You can find everything you want. 
For example a well-equipped kitchen a fridge a fan a television a bathroom a toilet and Wifi. 
The apartment is tidy and clean as well.

James is nice helpful and friendly. 
He always reply messages and phone-call quickly. 
He even prepare Coca Cola and coffee for me and my mum. 
I highly appreciate James. 

The apartment is located at the 5th floor. 
Since there is no escalator you have to walk the stairs. 
But this is not a problem for me and my mum. 

To conclude i have a perfect stay in James' apartment. 
Highly recommend this apartment if your want to spend a few days in Paris=D "
25677202,308741256,2018-08-17,46583414,Ian,We absolutely loved our stay at Pauline’s chic appartement in Paris. Our check in was seamless and we loved the style of the place. Pauline provides a concierge type welcome booklet with everything you need to know about the apartment and area. My wife and I brought our 4 and 6 year old children to Paris for the first time and they liked the apartment so much that we needed to convince them to leave the apartment so we could and enjoy beautiful Paris! Great place for a family to stay in Paris. Absolutely exceeded our expectations! Thank you Pauline!

13243111,258036579,2018-04-28,158707117,Maggie,"We were a group ofseven women aged between 50 and 70 who stayed for three nights. It was good to have a spacious apartment in a convenient location.  There were some minor problems when we arrived e.g. insufficient towels no tea towels and some broken light bulbs but a message to Mathilde soon produced results. 
We enjoyed our breakfasts of croissants and bread from the boulangerie opposite and there is a convenient Carrefour supermarket very close by though we ate out every evening so didn't do much cooking at the apartment. 
It would have been helpful to have more precise instructions for rubbish disposal as the notices in the kitchens about separating waste did not specify what could be recycled  and we had to re-sort the waste once we took it to the bins. 
Our otherwise enjoyable short break in Paris was somewhat spoilt by an extremely raucous and noisy party in the flat above us from 1 a.m to 6 a.m. on our last night there.  It kept us awake all night and our final day was spolt because we were too tired to do much walking around.  It would have been helpful to know that we could have phoned Mathilde at any hour for help in this situation.  There are very strict house rules telling guests not to disturb neighbours but no advice about what to do in the event of neighbours disturbing guests.  The house rules only state:  'Strictly no partying or loud music. Please consider other residents of the building.'  It would have been helpful to be told in advance rather than after the event that Mathilde would have responded in the middle of the night by calling the police to end the disturbance."

6831932,254818110,2018-04-18,29704608,Haruna & Pierre-Jean,Nous avons louer l’appartement lors de la visite de mes  parents sur Paris. Ils ont été ravi de leur séjour et on fait beaucoup de compliments sur la propreté des lieux. Manuel a toujours était très réactif à nos questions. L’ascenseur la proximité des restaurants des commerces et du métro font de cet appartement un pied à terre idéal pour apprécier la vie parisienne au pied de la butte Montmartre.

37380306,510505830,2019-08-16,14272117,Richard,Chiara’s place is incredible. It’s situated in a lively area slap bang in the middle of the greatest restaurants of the 11th arguably the best restaurants in Paris. The flat was clean very quiet (despite it being on a busy street) and the amenities were fantastic. Chiara responded super quickly to my questions and was happy to help at all times. I will be back for sure!

1540409,132137423,2017-02-16,98104961,Priscilla,The studio was exactly as advertised. The location was superb being right next to both fine dining and local cafes. It was also near shopping bars and the opera. We walked to Norte Dame and it took all but 30 min! The only suggestion I have is getting a more efficient heater. It was soo cold! I'm sure as the weather warms up a bit this will not be a problem. Linh provided so many maps and resources about the area and all around. I literally feel like that was thee best location to stay and place to stay! 
17861127,154423115,2017-05-24,124621690,Iveth,"Perfect flat for 4 adults it has everything you need beds are very comfy ! And it's very clean ... accuracy from pictures 100%

17392206,135561587,2017-03-05,12210459,Natacha,Très bon séjour. Ultra arrangeante pour les horaires et l appart est fonctionnel. Très bon rapport qualité prix. Je recommande et n'hésiterais pas à revenir 
15148422,155596606,2017-05-28,17059073,Marion,"Je suis partie 4 jours avec ma meilleure amie sur Paris pour visiter.

L'annonce de Laura manquait de précisions qui nous ont dérangées pendant notre séjour:
- les toilettes sont communs sur le palier et non pas dans l'appartement (comme le laissait sous-entendre ""salle de bain privative"")
- une seule pièce de 10m² environ regroupe tous les éléments du logement (clic-clac kitchenette douche). La douche donne donc directement sur la pièce avec uniquement un rideau en guise de séparateur
- la douche est très étroite même une personne petit gabarit (1m60) a du mal à se tourner et à bouger sans se cogner
- l'unique fenêtre de la pièce est très petite ce qui limite la capacité d'aération (problématique quand il fait chaud)
- la cuisine comporte le stricte minimum niveau ustensiles et électroménager. La bouilloire par contre est à éviter elle a laissé des espèces de copeaux métalliques dans l'eau lorsqu'on l'a faite chauffer...

De plus lorsque nous sommes arrivées l'accueil a été chaleureux mais sans papier toilette ni sac poubelle... Pour un séjour de 4jours c'est quand même malheureux de devoir en acheter. Ceci dit l'appartement était très propre les draps sentaient la lessive le clic-clac était confortable et le logement est placé dans le quartier indien (pas mal pour la nourriture si vous aimez épicé) à 2min à pied de la station chapelle et à 8min de la gare du nord (ce qui est pratique) et reste plutôt calme.

Bémol supplémentaire: dans les toilettes (déjà étroits de base) la tuyauterie murale a eu une fuite le matin de notre arrivée (surement par vétusté) et sur nos 4 jours de location la fuite n'a pas été réparée ce qui nous obligeait à mettre des bassines pour récupérer l'eau (ce qui mangeait quasiment toute la place des toilettes) et à tirer la chasse en versant de l'eau nous-même (la chasse avait été coupée pour limiter la fuite). Laura a essayé de joindre le propriétaire qui était indisponible ce n'est donc à priori pas de sa faute mais nous avons quand même subit la fuite...

EN RÉSUMÉ: appartement qui dépanne bien pour une personne ou un couple sans problème d'intimité qui veut passer le plus clair de son temps à visiter. Plutôt bien situé mais confort très limité dans ce logement. "
18593447,288978219,2018-07-11,82147898,Tommy,Cosy stay with a wonderful view and gives you the experience of a local Parisian.
36861036,526779882,2019-09-09,38739489,Catriona,Graham’s apartment is in the perfect part of Paris - close enough to the attractions that it’s convenient but not so close that you feel suffocated by other tourists! It’s reasonably sized compared to other places in Paris as well as being clean and functional. There are stairs and no elevator (something to consider if you have mobility constraints) though this is very typical for being in the heart of the city. There’s also plenty of shopping nearby as well as the metro. Food in the area is also sublime - we can not recommend Cafe de Museés enough. Thanks Graham!
1647534,35753657,2015-06-21,33854467,Jen,"Catalina and her family were beyond genuine souls. I've never known such kindness. I truly wish our families could adopt each other. Amazing people! 
I definitely need to recommend a very small hidden Italian restaurant just behind their place. The service is hit and miss but they try. "
30702355,553459434,2019-10-24,292780919,Brigitte,appartement tout à fait correct après une arrivée assez rebutante en raison des travaux qui envahissent entrée et escalier mais pas de gêne au niveau du bruit (visiblement les travaux avancent lentement!!!) .  Marie-Justine fait de son mieux (entretien de l'appartement ) pour pallier ces défauts liés aux travaux. Pour les amateurs de café il manque peut être une cafetière. Marie-Justine est réactive aux sms c'est appréciable.

1501832,18950612,2014-09-03,18691574,Kristi,"My sister and I stayed at Beau de Beaubourg for 10 days in August and absolutely loved it... a few of our thoughts below:

Pros:
- AMAZING location - close to everything great shopping in Le Marais wonderful restaurants (Nolita Pizza and Mi Va Mi are both worth checking out for lunch or a low-key dinner) 5 min walk to Notre Dame many metro stops very close by one direct train ride (only 25 mins) from the airport
- Super cute apartment - very clean spacious bright
- Only 1 flight of stairs to walk up (you will appreciate this after a day of walking / biking around Paris :))
- Very comfy Queen size bed
- Apartment looks just as the pictures show
- Ludovic was incredibly quick at responding to our questions prior to arrival 

Cons:
- Overlooks a busy street and over top of a bar so can get quite loud at night (although if you turn on the supplied fan it helps to drown out the noise)
- Being new to airbnb this may be typical and we understand that toiletries were not meant to be supplied but we were surprised not to have any of what we feel are some essentials – hand soap in the bathroom dishsoap in the kitchen  no more than 1 roll of toilet paper in the bathroom paper towel - we needed to purchase all of these on our first day.  The pro - there are a number of grocery stores close by to pick these things up! 

Overall we had a great experience and would highly recommend Beau de Beaubourg!"
6191782,263571249,2018-05-12,53179189,Breann,Audrey's place is located really close to two metro stations as well as a bus stop which made it so easy to move throughout the city. The apartment was very clean and cozy. Audrey has everything you need in the kitchen to prepare food as well as a living space with a smart tv where we were able to cast our own programming from our phones.  We got our exercise because the apartment is located on the top of a 5 storey building but the bed made up for it it was super comfortable. Each room had a window which was especially nice with the high temperatures in Paris during the time of our visit.  Would highly recommend this place!
17509203,428561589,2019-03-25,2645805,Hannah,"Really great location with lovely views to the canal. There is an amazing park nearby (we rented scooters!) an awesome brewery just around the corner and a few excellent boulangeries to choose from. 
 The apartment is big with all amenities and with big social spaces so great for five of us travelling together."

24850164,546891853,2019-10-14,3984234,Romain,I just had a wonderful stay at Daniel’s apartment. It is perfectly located in the heart of Paris. Close to subway stations and to many must-see Parisian attractions. The apartment was super clean very quiet and absolutely charming. Daniel was communicative. The check-in process was perfect. Daniel was kind enough to provide me with tons of good tips must-go restaurants and great shows and art exhibitions. I highly recommend this little gem to spend an amazing time in Paris.

하지만 내가 들렀던 때는 이상기후가 한창인 때라 다들 자정까지 문열어놓고 있어서 자기엔 너무 시끄러웠음 (파리 건물간 사이가 좁음)"

- Quiet neighbourhood
- Lovely views and balcony
- Secure building
- Lift to fit three adults to get to level 5
- Close to supermarket and bakery 
- Very comfortable beds
- Large bedroom 

Things Asmaa could improve:
- No toilet brush 
- Shower screen not clean 
- Uncomfortable pillows 
- Very squeaky floor boards
- One bedroom door doesn’t close
- No lock on bathroom door 
- No umbrella available to use"
1587440,427248501,2019-03-23,163626413,Anne,Jeremy and Quentin have a lovely place. The space was chic and more importantly clean!

53734,682941,2011-11-01,1302865,Meg,We had a great experience at Marion's apartment. We decided to rent Marion's apartment vs. getting a hotel room at a similar cost and was very happy with our decision considering it was way more spacious than hotels in the area clean had tons of character and in a great location on a tree lined boulevard in The Marais. Marion was out of town but her parents were there to drop off and pick up the keys. Marion provided us with some great suggestions for cool places in the area to check out before we arrived. Great experience overall.
23675646,269950645,2018-05-28,40387775,Alexis,Juan's apartment was centrally located in Saint Germain surrounded by great shops and restaurants. The apartment resembles a New York-style apartment (very small space but makes good use of the space). Perfect for two people but any more would be tight. Juan was very communicative and check-in and check-out was very easy. Juan was flexible with our timing and provided assistance when needed.
3552032,339168417,2018-10-21,7778705,Koralie,Already the second time with my mother in this apartment. It is small but has everything that you need.

29009650,353489530,2018-11-28,656616,Barbara & Kerry,this had everything needed for a short stay: Nespresso machine with capsules; shampoo soap and shower gel (no need to bring your own!) even toothpaste. it's extremely compact but it's amazing what you can put in a small space. even the wardrobe had proper wooden hangers (no cheap plastic!). and there is a boulangerie/patisserie 50m from the apartment so you can get fresh bread and croissants in the morning. The apartment is extremely quiet (almost no street noise) and the wind-down shutters block out the light. Great place to stay.

13920678,96885378,2016-08-24,87852165,John,"My Daughter and I stayed at Francesca's apartment for 4 days and we found it ideal for our needs. The fridge was full of food when we arrived which was an appreciated bonus as all other places we stayed supplied nothing. The position is ideal as 5 minutes walk to the Montmartre restaurants and La Basilique du Sacre Coeur. The Metro was an easy walk to  Anvers station. The steps will keep you nice & fit.
We would highly suggest a stay at Francesca's apartment as she made a great effort to ensure we had a pleasant stay in Paris."
13071600,267056992,2018-05-21,62790143,Josse,We stayed here for two weeks and loved the appartement even after only a few days this felt like home.

The place allowed us to live the real French experience unlike hotel stays. The first floor is spacious and it even has a large balcony the second floor is small and cozy but if you are tall you need to have in mind you won't be able to fully stand up.

Nans was always prompt to answer our questions.

402516,1981780,2012-08-14,2587383,Michael,"What more can I/we say. All of the other reviews are true and correct. Marco is communicative and responsive. The loft is clean and the layout is truly perfect  - it is almost a ""U"" shape and so there is plenty of ""space"" to spread out. 

We were two couples and we each had a bedroom and we never felt cramped or on top of each other. The place was spotless! Plenty of anything that you need - towels hot water dishwasher. The toilet is in a separate room from the shower room so easy breezy to multi task!

And as everyone else points out in their reviews: LOCATION! I mean PERFECT. My first airbnb experience and it was flawless! 

Marco's loft made our Paris trip a dream! Thank you MARCO! Thank you for the other detailed reviewers. I would only add that the photos do not do the loft justice - the space is much bigger in person! The layout and the location! PERFECT - we didn't even notice the lack of windows! HA!"

Жилье выглядит почти также как на фото. Весьма комфортно все работает просторно по парижским меркам удобная кровать. Много интересных вещей и книг. Окна выходят на парк с цветами и поющими птичками. Шумоизоляция практически отсутствует все в доме ведут себя очень тихо.
Хозяин внимательный и приветливый встречал нас лично у метро отличная коммуникация. Дает много полезных советов о городе что посмотреть и где что можно купить. Остановились бы еще раз в этих апартаментах. Спасибо Jerome!"

There was a bit of noise from the other residents but having two restaurants at the front door was a bonus. We both loved our stay in Paris and this place is spot on for a couple or two people. Thanks Amélie your place is gorgeous.

The apartment is well equipped and clean and it really gives a feeling of the parisian living style. The location is really close to the Pantheon and Notre Dame Cathedral. Nabile is super nice and always available to help and to give recommendations about the city she truly is a great host. I will contact her again next time I visit Paris :)

1532445,7352910,2013-09-16,8112869,Hannah,"I tried AirBnb for the first time and it couldn't had been better. My brother and I took my mum on a spontaneous trip and it was perfect - which was as to a large part as well thanks to Sylvain-Philippe and his Apartment. His place is so lovely (and just as described and shown in the pictures) and well located (I know Paris - but his neighborhood became my new favorite). 

Sylvain-Philippe was very kind helpful and just perfect host. He speaks all kind of languages and gives good tips to find the way around. We alway got hold on him and he even let us stay until Sunday night until our train left. It's almost as staying at some friends great parisian house while he's out of town. 

I would definitely go there again."

5705203,547520511,2019-10-15,175529422,Mollie,"I never write reviews for anything but wow. Really the worst experience I have ever had staying anywhere and made our time in paris full of anxiety. The type of space Guillaume claims to create is a lie. Every night came home late and drunk. Came home drunk one night and turned our laundry off a minute before the cycle was done. Said it was too late to do it because the walls were ""paper thin"" but then began watching TV with huge speakers at an incredible volume when we said we were going to sleep?? Watched for 2 hours on very high volume after we said good night. The following morning we hung our laundry to dry in our room since he didnt give us any room on drying rack. After we left the house that morning he came into our room while we were out and moved our clothes!!! He moved them around the house to dry in different places (not the drying rack still) and we had to hunt them down??? He is looking for things to be passive aggressive about as opposed to communicating directly about his wants are- meanwhile crosses EVERY normal boundary an airbnb host should respect. My partner and I are both very gentle and considerate people really wanting mutualism in a space & for everyone to be comfortable. If you want to stay somewhere with low stress: this is the wrong spot!! It seriously was like having to live around a college student who doesn't know the basics of how to take care of himself or directly communicate. What a misleading place seemed very easy-going bright and calm. In actuality it was: childish anxiety-enducing and depressing to watch."
629248,18617203,2014-08-29,581438,Julia,This was a great apartment in a great location - we had a lovely room with plenty of space and Maguy was a great host.

6916845,68285931,2016-04-04,31005786,Elena,Мы очень довольны квартирой Дельфины: тихо чисто оборудована всем что нужно и даже больше. Район спокойный метро рядом. Если доведется еще раз побывать в Париже с удовольствием бы остановились в этом доме. Рекомендуем очень!

It's on a a quiet street with lots of restaurants. Be sure to eat at Shum. Absolutely fantastic and reasonable! There's a small grocery store and a pharmacy right across the street from the apartment. 
Igor is very friendly and greeted me when I arrived. He has thorough instructions about how to operate the television broadband internet and the washer/dryer. The kitchen is fully functional.
The location is near the Champs-Élysées with walkable access to the Arc de Triomphe and the great shopping in the area."

23284311,539926210,2019-10-02,19962231,Nick,"This was a great apartment for my week Paris. It's in a quiet neighborhood compared to the more central parts of the city but it's close to two metro lines that make it really easy to get anywhere. You can be at the Eiffel Tower in 25 minutes.

The kitchen came in handy and there are a few supermarkets to pick up groceries at within easy walking distance. Also it was nice to be able to do laundry.

The layout of the apartment is nice and if you have someone sleeping on the pull-out sofa bed you can separate the studio with a curtain. Oh and the bathroom isn't in the bedroom so your roommate wouldn't have to walk through your bedroom to get to it in the middle of the night...which is nice.

Definitely a warm apartment and I can imagine that it's tricky to keep it cool in the summer but I was there in late September and it was perfectly lovely to have the windows open in the evening. 

 Hervé was a great host and responded quickly to all my messages. 

A very nice stay!"
22235516,253890770,2018-04-15,68217663,Julie,L’appartement est propre et très bien placé proche de tout dans une petite rue calme. Je recommande.
2049794,99144219,2016-09-03,14241176,Tara,"I was in Paris for a week as my daughter started school at AUP. Adèle's flat was very convenient for me as it was only a couple minutes walk to most campus buildings lots of dining and grocery options on the street and less than 5 minutes to the nearest Metro stop. Adèle was a wonderful host helping me out with so many things during my stay and going above and beyond with the tips and information she provided about the surrounding area. She also has been helpful with providing information for my daughter as she adjusts to life in Paris. 

Others have cited the pullout bed as the only drawback but don't let 
that scare you away. It's not as bad as it sounds (no metal bar across your back as you sleep!). 

Although my daughter's apartment is about 15 minutes away by Metro I will likely book Adèle's flat whenever I'm in town to visit since it was such a wonderful experience."
21225357,274468458,2018-06-09,1813870,Eugenio,Apartamento  mínimo sin espacio para colgar o guardar ninguna ropa  sábanas y toallas viejas y arrugadas. Arco de Triunfo a 10 estaciones de Metro y con 1 cambio de línea. Anfitrión no deja ni papel higiénico ni jabón. No hay secador de pelo. Mala iluminación. Cerradura de puerta y timbre no funcionan.
17916375,174897114,2017-07-27,22063763,Émilie,La propreté du logement laissait un peu à désirer et l'immeuble mal isolé pour les bruits  mais dans l'ensemble nous avons apprécié notre séjour et surtout la proximité du centre de la ville.
13721276,137890709,2017-03-18,8575930,Morganna,"The location could not have been better! There's a supermarket and pharmacy across the street (2min walk) and the Louvre and metro was only 2 blocks away - extremely walkable and very convenient. The dishwasher and towels/slippers/toiletries included were very helpful - a nice mix between an Airbnb and hotel. 

The only drawback to my room is that is on floor 1 (or second floor up from the ground level) so when there are drunk/loud people outside at night you can hear them as if the windows were open. But then again this is a second-floor studio in a busy European city - what else could you expect! Thankfully I had ear buds from my flight to Paris so the noise was not a bother. If you book this room bringing ear buds would be my only suggestion. Everything else was great! :)"
30881319,535822161,2019-09-25,25637114,Philipp,For our 2 days stop in Paris the studio in the  lively neighbourhood between canal st. martin and belleville was a ideal choice. Nice and clean place and good communication.
24402228,271147802,2018-05-31,16130745,Nikhilesh,Irene's place is clean comfortable stylish and located in a great neighbourhood with lots of nice cafes and restaurants. The apartment overlooks the street and you can catch a glimpse of Parian street life through the window. She's a very relaxed host but also really thoughtful and provided a massive breakfast! There are also two gorgeous cats a bit shy but extremely well behaved. Highly recommended!!!

"
10451648,102470171,2016-09-18,1334399,Ali,Stephane was the perfect host easy to communicate and willing to make your stay a great memory. Staying in Stephane's apartment was the best decision we could have made while staying in Paris. Beyond the beautiful decor and aesthetic that the space carried it was conveniently located for all of the destinations we aimed to visit. We never felt it was too far away from anything. Our experience couldn't have been better. From the delivering of the keys and the suggestions for local food and drink to the cleanliness of the home and comforts it contained this is the ideal place to stay in Paris if it's available.

Yet the best part is the great communication they had with us. They were always available and willing to help.

Romy is super hospitable and gave me a really warm welcome. 
The room is perfect for a solo traveller and is outfitted with a toilet sink bathtub fridge and an electric kettle. 
Please note the room is on the top floor with a long narrow staircase leading up to it so this place really isn’t for travellers with a lot (or big pieces) of luggage.
A great place highly recommended!"

Laure was very accessible by phone for any questions and was there to check us in in person. We would definitely recommend Laure’s place."

35981840,547863086,2019-10-16,16344086,Grace,Really lovely quaint apartment. Has everything you need for a stay it was a perfect base for travelling around Paris. Anaïs is a lovely host great at communicating. Thank you so much for my stay.
881789,536188369,2019-09-26,12597518,Sarah,Beautiful apartment in a great location. Would definitely recommend staying here! Only issue was that Maxine had to cancel the final night of our stay for a medical emergency with the owners so we had to change to a hotel. This was a month in advance thankfully so we could arrange this without trouble.
21179534,412360838,2019-02-15,238947398,Caterina,"Marie was very kind since the first time I contacted her. She was available for all my needs and I Also had access to the whole apartement because she wasn’t there. 
The apartment is small and suitable for two people but for my need of privacy it is perfect for just one person or one couple. The neighborhood is full of stores and it is very safe. Plus the metro is very close and you can walk to the Eiffel Tower."
4020203,212528046,2017-11-18,25005383,Kathryn,Mathilde's apartment appears exactly as the pictures portray. It is very beautiful stylish and comfortable. The communication was also superb and check in was a breeze. One thing to note - Mathilde does note in the description that the 2 bathrooms is an ensuite bathroom (shower and sink) plus another bathroom with shower and toilet but I guess we did not read carefully enough. The ensuite bathroom does not have a toilet so there is just one toilet in the apartment. Not a huge deal but just a detail we overlooked. Location is phenomenal and we had a lovely stay in Paris! Thank you Mathilde.
21687636,548302744,2019-10-17,153573180,Amy And Toby,Wonderful apartment in a cool cafe filled area ! This apartment is a great size for 3 people we were able to cook and hang out comfortably. It is close to many train stops and even the train to Disneyland. Sebastián was an excellent host and responded quickly to our messages. Would definitely return & can recommend to others.

4647190,24858838,2015-01-03,23821138,Giuseppe,Maelle è stata molto disponibile e ci ha fatto trovare anche lo spumante per festeggiare il Capodanno. La casa è molto confortevole. Ha 3 bagni ma in realtà 2 sono dotati di doccia e lavandino mentre il terzo ha solo il water. Tuttavia è comoda per 6 persone e ci siamo trovati benissimo.
8755707,139706303,2017-03-26,29513096,Anita,C'est un petit appartement très proche du métro.
780909,12231457,2014-04-27,9287380,Stephanie,Location Location Location!!  I could not have asked for anything better!!  The apartment is close to everything (food shops Eiffel Tower metro).   Apartment is as (Website hidden by Airbnb) surprises.  It's really clean and modern and is the perfect size for 2 people.  We found the bed really comfortable too!  It was nice having a washing machine and right on the corner is a laundry mat where you can dry your clothes  for 1 or 2 euros.  If I ever find myself back in Paris I will stay here again.  Hosts were great and easy to contact but once you are there you will find that you have everything you need. 
7138087,89788894,2016-07-30,35765613,Stephen,Lovely place - small but description is accurate. Perfect for Sacre Coeur and Monmartre and easy access to Metro and supermarket. It's not luxury by any means but we lived very happily for 3 nights with 11 year old twins. The streets in Paris are often dirty and this is so around here as much as anywhere else but don't be put off. Very good communication from Hugo and we were made very welcome by his Mum including a very kind bottle of wine.  
1900636,26521110,2015-02-15,12168604,Daisy,I highly recommend this place! its so clean and near to everything. I feel safe in the neighborhood. The best thing about this place is its in the first floor. If ur not travelling light this is the place for u. I would stay again whenever I will be back in Paris.thank you Malika and Hilal!
14201424,166935892,2017-07-05,25909767,Kim,The location of the apartment was very convenient to several metro lines and near many restaurants but because it was on a smaller side street it was nice and quiet. We were able to walk to the Louvre in just 15 mins and just 5 minutes to Rue Montergeuil with lots of places to eat. The apartment is very modern and impeccably clean as pictured. We appreciated the fans in each bedroom as it was hot the last day of our stay.  Between the fans and the large windows it was cool at night. The blackout drapes were very nice as well. One note is that the larger master bedroom is still set up with two twin beds pushed together. It was fine but a true queen size bed would have been a bit nicer. The closet storage in the master and the master bath were nice sized for a Paris apartment. All in all a great place to stay and a good value.
21360836,496369800,2019-07-27,123963249,Ashleigh,Steeve’s apartment is definitely the perfect place to stay in Paris! It was our first time in France and we happened to come during a 108 degree weather heat wave. Considering AC is a rare amenity in Europe the ice cold air conditioning was a life saver! My husband is very particular about places we stay while on vacation & he approved. Steeve responded quickly to all messages was there to check us in & made sure we had everything we needed. There is literally anything you would need- amazing sky light windows washer/dryer detergent nice iron nice hair dryer modern decor kitchen appliances awesome location- this place has it all!
1997684,330877834,2018-10-01,40447303,Ginger,Wow! What a beautiful and perfect little apartment. The location is amazing--right in the heart of the 6th with easy access to cafes and restaurants. The apartment is *beautiful* especially if you like contemporary design. It's amazingly beautiful. The inset blue lights in the evening are the perfect touch and how can you not like a shower with a view! Everything was perfectly appointed and even though a small space (with some low ceilings) it never felt uncomfortable. Michelle was sweet to leave us a welcoming bottle of champagne too. She was helpful with good ideas and had oodles of books to consult. This was the perfect place to start our adventures every day!
26183496,341561765,2018-10-27,53406995,Alex,Un piso perfecto luminoso y muy cercano a la plaza de la Bastilla. Rodeado de multitud de restaurantes de muy variada gastronomía e inmerso en un fenomenal ambiente parisino. Muy recomendable.
15528084,221940646,2017-12-28,38154236,Vicky,It’s neer to the bus station and metro! Markets and restaurants around the apartment. Had a great time at Emilien’s apartment!

30166423,532575349,2019-09-20,27180904,Shad,"The location is on a quiet street in a nice part of Paris. Lots of shops and food places around and only about 10-15 minutes walk to Notre Dame. 

This is a studio setup but very clean and with all amenities we could think off. Includes a washing machine as well as usual kitchen appliances. 

Bathroom is compact with small sink but excellent rain shower head as well as a hand held shower. 

Host is extremely friendly and helpful. Met us at check in. Gave us good suggestions for local transport as well."

656822,137247027,2017-03-14,56485634,Ankur,I stayed with Jean with my wife for 3 nights 4 days. Jean is a fantastic host. He even came to receive us early in the morning & to see us off! He provided us very well documented tips & resources. His house was exceptionally clean & well stuffed plus the location couldn't be better since it was very quite though a stone's throw from centre. The place is highly recommended for couples especially.
5402219,449201668,2019-05-06,34925744,Ada,Myriam's place is well located - close to the metro and some nice restaurants. The neighbourhood is quiet and pretty. Myriam's house is well decorated. A very nice stay. Would love to go back.

7555680,466372171,2019-06-09,228419081,Richard,"I stay in apartments in the Marais to live away from the tourist crowds and get closer to a ""local"" experience.  Likewise it gives me a chance to sample local living conditions and not hotels.   Alexandra’s place has all the ingredients of that goal:  18th-19th century building with an early retrofit of plumbing and electrical work and personal decorating representing the owner.  If I was dropped into Alexandra’s apartment I would know that I was in (Website hidden by Airbnb) doubt.  If I stepped onto the street I would know I was in Paris and if I walked around the block I would know I was in the Marais.  
This trip I introduced my grand-daughters (13-15) to their first foreign  exposure.  If I could show you their daily faces this review would be complete."
1139576,7551899,2013-09-24,7857754,Stella,This apartment was perfect for our needs let me start with the delicious breakfast for every morning and the deco of her apartment is very chic clean and very comfortable bed with the Eiffel tower view! The location is great too 2 mins by walk to the metro and many restaurants and local stores around. Karina is such a great host! She is too good always willing to help and giving me a lot useful information! We enjoyed so much to stay in her fabulous apartment. I would not hesitate in recommending this apartment for your stay in Paris! Again Karina is a wonderful host and will make your stay that much more enjoyable! Thanks! :)

595610,7390229,2013-09-18,6111583,Stephen,This apartment is just like the description and the photos only better! It was ideal for a couple with teenage daughters aged 14 and 15. Christine and Pascal sent detailed instructions for the transfer by RER and metro from CDG but we decided to take a taxi instead because we had a lot of luggage. The taxi cost 55 euros. Check in (with a stack of crepes to greet us) and check out were a breeze. The location is fantastic only 15 minutes to the Panthéon and 20 to Notre Dame on foot. The metro station is 5 minutes away and with one change you are at the Arc de Triomphe in 40 minutes. Great boulangeries bank and supermarket are within minutes in Rue Linné. We loved visiting Rue Mouffetard for eating and the Jardin des Plantes for relaxing walks. The apartment itself feels spacious and is absolutely quiet. It is well stocked with everything you need including umbrellas and raincoats plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe and beautifully decorated. Christine and Pascal are the perfect hosts and both made us feel very comfortable. We will happily recommend the apartment to friends and will not hesitate to use it if we visit Paris again.

Et encore Merci Dominique.

13277537,338048789,2018-10-18,211786943,Caroline,A simple small clean apartment in a beautiful Parisien building at a perfect location in the city. A lot of stairs so you'll get stronger legs in a few days. Guillaume responds quickly. If you don't care to go to the toilet with the door open this is the place to be!
31854136,410404480,2019-02-10,114330660,Jorge,"This apartment was really really nice. The beds were comfortable nice shower there was a tv with netflix included. The neighborhood was really active with a lot of restaurants supermarkets and a nearby metro station (5 minutes walking)
It was easy to get the key from the cafe and the communication with Dorian was very good.
I would recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to have a wonderful experience in Paris!!"
15121569,248298808,2018-03-31,174179748,Catrin,Schöne kleine Wohnung in toller zentraler Lage in Montmartre. Alles hat gut geklappt. Leider hatten wir Probleme mit dem Türöffnungsprinzip. Es wurde uns vorher nicht erklärt. Die Schlüsselübergabe erfolgte sehr schnell. Zum Glück kam eine Bewohnerin des Hauses und wir konnten fragen. In der Wohnung ist alles was man braucht. Es könnte etwas sauberer sein. Ansonsten schöne kleine Wohnung mit einem gewissen Charme in toller Lage.  Freundliche Gastgeberin . Immer gerne wieder.

Parfait pour 4 personnes : chambre spacieuse et canapé-lit dans la pièce principale facilement repliable.
Dahvia s'est montrée très réactive et bien organisée.
Nous avons pu convenir de notre heure d'arrivée (nous avons été accueillis par une amie de Dahvia) ce qui nous a permis de déposer nos  bagages et ainsi profiter de notre première après-midi.

6916845,77368419,2016-05-31,61674931,Robin,Das Appartement von Delphine war super für unseren dreitägigen Aufenthalt in Paris. Es liegt schön im elften Arrondissement unweit der Métro und hat alles was man braucht. Delphine war sehr freundlich und die Kommunikation mit ihr lief problemlos. Beim Check-in empfing sie und persönlich und am Tag der Abreise ermöglichte sie uns unser Gepäck tagsüber noch abzustellen. Alles in allem lässt sich die Unterkunft für ein paar Tage in Paris sehr empfehlen!

786714,7580280,2013-09-25,7923940,John,We had a great stay in Christine's Parisian flat. It's location is so handy to the centre of the tourist quarter and getting places an easy walk or via the Metro. Christine was most accommodating and helpful so our whole experience of the 4 full days we spent in Paris went like a dream. The flat is spacious and comfortable and with good security the amenities modern and easy to use and local grocery stores are within easy walking distance. If we manage to get back to Paris we will definitely be asking Christine for the opportunity to stay in her apartment again. Highly recommended. Just one word of caution - there are a number of stairs to climb with your bags but the effort is well worth it. Thanks again Christine for making our stay so enjoyable. Warmest regards John & April.

14499436,445386727,2019-04-29,17773197,Julie,Perfect apartment for three people. The bedroom is super cozy and very comfortable (the sheets are amazing). The sleeping couch works perfectly for one (or two if your friendly). We were three friends sharing the apartment but if we were to be two couples the bathroom (which is in the bedroom) would be more challenging. The location is also great a bit outside of the centre of Paris but super close to the metro which has two lines (so you can get to Marais without chaning and to the Latin Quarter without changing). The little terasse is also very nice for sunny days and warmer evenings :-) We enjoyed it a lot!
20466671,455874825,2019-05-20,261089742,Gopal Krishna,Great location. Good amenities in the apartment. Overall pretty good for a stay with family.
12821199,146220758,2017-04-22,119670793,Agustín,I stayed for 5 weeks. The Apartment is very close to La Motte-Picquet-Grenelle metro station (2 blocks away) so it is very easy to take any of the lines that go to the main touristic attractions or any other part of the city. It is also walkable distance from the Eiffel Tower and the surroundings (I would say around 10-15 minutes). The Apartment is airy and has lots of light from the two big windows in the bedroom/living room. Jihane was very nice and accommodating.

445253,5169415,2013-06-16,244211,Paola,"Violaine and Romain's apartment is beautifully decorated with a lot of cool design features. My 3 year old nephew loved all the children's books and toys we all felt at home. It was very close to the supermarket bakery metro station and walking distance to Sacre Coeur and very Parisian Cafes/Restaurants.

They were excellent hosts and super friendly gave us a lot of helpful tips and information about the amenities in the area. They even had a welcomed us with bottle of wine and meat!. Also booked a taxi to take us to the airport which was pretty handy as we left really early in the morning.

I highly recommend their place we'll definitely stay there in a future trip to Paris it was a great experience. Way better than staying at a hotel!

Merci beaucoup Violaine + Romain! À bientôt!

Coming from Shanghai myself got in Paris early morning landing around 6am. The owner kept close contact with me all the way and even offer to come pick me up after a mistaken drop off by my driver. Owner was nice enough to wait for me early morning and make sure I was set at the apartment before leaving. 

The loft apartment is very cute you will feel you actually live in Paris! The house itself has everything you need very quiet at night as well. A step away out will have grocery shop along with cafes and restaurants/shops. Very good location! Easy to get taxi/Uber. 

I would stay here again if I ever visit Paris again. Cheers everyone! I had a pleasant stay :)"

6536404,73076209,2016-05-06,284917,John,"This would have been a 5-star review - Floriane has a very nice apartment in a fantastic location and she is welcoming and organized - but she has some odd features that ultimately tarnished all of the upsides and make us unable to recommend that people stay with her. We are also Airbnb hosts with more then 100 5-star ratings so we know a thing or two about hosting and staying at Airbnb properties. 

The problem with this listing is that Floriane charges for normal wear and tear on her linens. When we left she discovered some discolorations on a hand and wash towels and some faded colors on the pillow cases. She proceeded to charge us full cost (62 euros) for replacement.  We have no idea how the linens became discolored or if they were that way when we arrived but whatever the condition they were in when we left they were not new or pristine when we arrived  yet we paid for replacement with new materials.  So expect that she will charge full replacement costs for even minor damage which may even be present when you arrive. "

10891540,329568539,2018-09-29,52785066,Uyen And Taylor,The space is small and cute big enough for 2 people. It's near 2 metro stations which makes getting around very convenient. There is a great park across the street as well as some yummy and reasonably priced restaurants in the neighborhood. Glad to be staying far away from the touristy places. Hugues is an excellent host. He took the time and sat with us to explain the metro system and recommended some nice places to visit. Do not hesitate to book.
33485851,458484573,2019-05-26,185213753,Tess,David was such helpful & it was easy to communicate. The flat is very cosy in an idyllic area. It felt better than staying at a hotel & we left very satisfied.
18350356,272381714,2018-06-03,168164105,Gisele,"Considering the OUTSTANDING location of this apartment you can't find a better deal. 

David is awesome at communication and even checked with me to be sure I understood the size of the beds for my children. I wish he had been present to help us check in because I had more questions. 

This place is not ideal for neat-freaks. You must like vintage/shabby chic/bohemian style (which we do) old floors and the occasional spider."
21696387,238252067,2018-02-25,1371129,Rosie,I had a great time staying at Marion's. The place is very spacious and well styled. Plenty of amenities - dishwasher washing machine bose speakers and it's in a great location too!
650980,22542394,2014-11-09,21684235,Denise,Sophie was not available to meet us though we did meet at a later date however her neighbour let us into the flat and Sophie had made provision for basic supplies like milk butter etc. The flat is in the perfect location 5 minutes walk to metro very safe area a bakery and butcher downstairs quaint restaurant on the corners and a little supermarket one street down. The flat was spacious and clean no need to feel guilty about eating baguettes daily as the stairs take it off :). If  you want to experience life as a Parisian I definitely recommend Sophie's place.

28859788,458547782,2019-05-26,37644515,Sara,Very cute apartment on the 5th floor with an amazing view from the terrace. Super clean as well. The host was kind enough to wait for my arrival late at night after a delayed flight.
17762411,288965191,2018-07-11,166248493,Bruce,We had a super time  the places was a great easy to get on metro local restaurants were  great we almost did not want to leave the area. We can’t thank you enough for sharing your place with us thanks the Murphy Family
614987,209389934,2017-11-05,146229061,Chelsea,This would have to be the number 1 location in Paris. We could walk everywhere! The Louvre is on your doorstep. Cosy apartment and very clean :-)
24292717,490248819,2019-07-18,2206506,James,Walid was a great host and very kind and friendly.  The apartment is in a convenient area close to two metro stations.  However keep in mind that the bed is a sofa bed and the pressure in the shower is not so strong.  A fine value for Paris overall.
5167638,488618326,2019-07-15,5642795,Leslie,I enjoyed my stay in this apartment. It was clean and simply furnished and it had the necessary items for me to do a little cooking. Check-in and check-out were easy and Angie and Chris were quick to respond. The location was convenient and very close to the Bonne Nouvelle metro stop. It took me about 20 minutes to walk to places in Le Marais. Angie's recommendations for places to visit in the neighborhood were very helpful. I loved having dinner at Bonhomie. The walls were a little thin; I could hear when people were walking up and down the stairs especially when I was trying to fall asleep.

934232,12891641,2014-05-13,7586445,Nga,"Fred's flat was absolutely wonderful for our 4-day trip to Paris. The flat was beautifully decorated and set out. Everything was immaculate and was very homely and well presented. Walking distance within metropolitan station. Even though it's located on a fairly happening and busy street the flat is located inset so you can't hear any noise from the streets or the bars and restaurants close by. The personal touches left by Fred (eg chocolates and the detailed info guest book) were lovely.

As we got into Paris close to midnight Fred provided us with extremely detailed instructions on how to access the flat. He was very attentive to make sure that we were okay during our stay. Would absolutely recommend Fred's place to anyone staying in Paris and would love to stay here in the future if we come back.     "

The place is perfectly setup for a visit with nice touches like a Nespresso coffee maker washing machine and well supplied Eurpoean kitchen. The location is superb right in Marais making it easy to walk metro Uber or bike anywhere in the city. Tony was great at communicating warm and friendly and generally made us feel very welcome. Really a lovely way to experience Paris.

19263737,541409514,2019-10-05,2271625,Rhodin,Wonderful apartment that is walking distance from Gare du Nord with a metro stop a block away. Beds are very comfortable and there is sufficient space for hanging out in the moving and dining area. Had a great stay and would highly recommended for large groups.
728396,368064984,2019-01-06,27969575,Olivia,"Lovely apartment in a great location! My husband and I stayed for 5 nights and this was a perfect home base for a trip to Paris a few blocks from Place de la Republique and within easy walking distance of many shops restaurants grocery stores and attractions. The neighborhood is lively and charming. A 10-15 minute Uber/taxi or a pleasant ~40 minute walk to the Louvre and the center of the city. The apartment itself is very cute clean and comfortable. Though it's small it's well-equipped with everything you might need. Wifi worked well. Most importantly Kristin responded very promptly to messages and was friendly and helpful. Kristin also went above and beyond to provide a packet with lots of info about the apartment neighborhood and Paris in general in advance of our stay. 

A few quick notes. Check in was fine but slightly confusing -- while someone met me at the apartment they met me *inside* the apartment so I waited on the street for a few minutes before I called her and realized she was inside and I was supposed to use the code provided to get in. She also didn't speak English but Kristin luckily called me and we sorted everything within a minute or two. Just a note for future travelers: you'll need to note the code and directions on getting into the building even though someone will meet you there. 

My only other advice for future visitors is to be careful not to use too much power at once; running the laundry and the electric kettle at the same time was enough to blow the power for me. Luckily we found the fuse box quickly and Kristin responded to messages promptly -- not a big deal just something to be aware of. 

Overall this was a beautiful apartment in a fantastic area and I'd happily stay here again. Thank you for your hospitality Kristin!"

26967711,498200295,2019-07-29,32441749,Valerie,Alban’s appartement is heel functioneel gelegen in de niet zo toeristische buurt dichtbij Canal Saint-Martin. Het ligt dichtbij verschillende metro- en bushaltes leuke bars en gezellige restaurants. Daarnaast antwoordde Alban altijd heel snel op onze berichten en/of vragen. Het enige minpuntje was dat het appartement toch iets rommeliger en minder proper was dan verwacht.
3893362,34765070,2015-06-12,26856714,Jennifer,"Ruth was there to great us at our arrival. She sent very accurate and helpful directions to the apartment from the metro station. Communication with Ruth was very easy. She offered some recommendations and described the area to us when we arrived. 
The apartment very clean and cozy. It's small but all you need for a short stay in Paris.
The location of the apartment is excellent! Very close to several metro stations and lots of options for food around. 
We would love to stay here again on a return trip to Paris. "
30682787,431926134,2019-04-02,6360784,Cristian,"El alojamiento está muy bien ubicado es muy lindo y con unas vistas increíbles.  Ideal para 2 parejas con ""confianza"" (es pequeño a una pareja le toca el sofa cama) o familia con 1-2 niños.
Pero tuvimos problemas con el host (Yves) que no nos comunicó que había ruidosas obras en el apartamento de al lado los días de semana estos ruidos (taladro martillazos gritos golpes) imposibilitaban que se pudiera disfrutar del alojamiento entre las 9am y las 5pm.
Por otra parte Yves cobra 30€ por la ropa de cama + 30€ por check out tarde (después de las 20hs) ambos en efectivo al entregar las llaves. Debo decir que luego de negociar con él nos ""regaló"" los 30€ del check out tarde. (llegamos 22:30hs)"
12717734,140173971,2017-03-28,9151692,Kirk,"Great set of 4 rooms in one bldg. on 2 floors 6&7 serviced by elevator. We took all rooms for 10 adults to sleep in 4 total bedrooms. TV and nice gathering space and large eating space and table upstairs.  Quiet at night to sleep but nearby construction started early.
Newer apt with nice amenities clean showers that gave hot water very good towels and bedding toiletries provided as well as slippers. Beds were firm but clean very secure and private once in the rooms though in the middle of apt neighborhood. Had full kitchen on upper floor but we never really used to cook just the fridge - no view of anything really but you can see top of Eiffel tower from upper floor bedroom window.
  Got door codes from phone call to host and never had or needed keys. 5 min walk to subway (St Lazaire stop and Train station). 20 min by subway to Louvre 20 min walk up hill to Montmarte and Sacre Couer. 30+ min by Uber or van to airport 45+ min by subway line with connections.
 Would stay here again for sure."

On accède très rapidement aux lignes de métro 4 et 10 ainsi qu'au RER C. Le quartier est très vivant et animé. Le coeur de Paris est accessible très rapidement.

Seul bémol le téléphone portable ne passe pas dans l'appartement mais Anita met à disposition un téléphone fixe donc pas de problème.
Anita reste joignable en cas de besoin. Personnellement tout était parfait je n'ai pas eu besoin de la joindre.

7392235,288149427,2018-07-09,56764383,Taylor,Great location and value. Walking distance to many different amenities and the metro line. Quick Access from the train station as well. There is a simple market right around the corner from the apartment which is great for a quick snack bottle of wine or beer. The apartment is small but perfect for 2 people. Access was simple and we had no issues. The apartment itself is clean and very nice but the building is a bit tired. Note you do have to walk up 3 flights of steep stairs to get to the entry which was fine for us but if you have luggage or mobility issues it may be difficult. Great location and Good value and I would recommend this spot again.

The location is really good for night walks in the city and around the Seina etc. There was nothing to be unhappy about :) ... maybe more coffe capsules to make more coffes in the coffe machine :).
1329018,280077031,2018-06-22,114418149,Jennifer,This lovely large classic Parisian apartment is delightful as was the warm hospitality of the hostess and her accommodation of my needs. The lift was a bonus and having a full kitchen after the tiny kitchenettes of my last trip was a delight. The only downside was that my room was next to the family’s main bathroom and I was woken early by those showering. This however was a minor point and I would happily stay here again. Definitely recommend!

18050436,282331336,2018-06-27,110049159,Cheddi,"For our first trip to Europe we opened to use various Airbnb locations for the three countries we visited so our experiences are fairly informed. We used visitor reviews to book the appropriate locations and apartments- I think it only fair to leave an honest review for those who choose to do the same. 

Cons
-Dusty- not clean/unkempt 
-Dirty sheets/ smelled dirty/used
-Dog hair everywhere 
-Toilet filthy- one roll of toilet paper-although notice of two occupants was given. 
-Black mold in shower
-Rust in shower
-Shower head noticeably rusting /flaking
-One towel provided although notice of two occupants was given. 
-Furniture dirty/torn/destroyed
-Notice of construction outside of all windows was given day of check in 
-not good if you are an allergy sufferer as there is a lot of dust as well as pet hair. 
-Didn’t use kitchen as there were no towels and coffee maker looked dirty 

Pros
-secure location 
-wireless was reliable 
-Close proximity to Eiffel and Arc as well as transportation (metro and buses) - all within reasonable walking distance. 
-Was very flexible with check in and check out. 

Overall- the apartment would have been ok if it were clean but it wasn’t. We didn’t expect spectacular given the price point but  good was expected. I would not recommend this apartment  for anyone who has a basic standard  for cleanliness. If you are literally looking for a good location to sleep- and leave after waking book this apartment and bring your own sheets as well as toilet paper and towels. You’ll be set."

The location was perfect for me being so close to the all the stations and walking distance to all the shops and restaurants. Your place felt very home-y and had everything I needed - especially the coffee machine and a very comfy bed. Would definitely come back here when I’m in Paris again.

4716092,56020605,2015-12-08,42761523,Claudia,Louise è una persona gentile precisa ed efficiente: ha risposto in modo veloce ed esauriente a tutte le nostre richieste di ulteriori informazioni e dettagli. In particolare vogliamo ringraziarla  per il supporto che ci ha dato nello scegliere un mezzo alternativo alla metro per raggiungere Parigi dall'aereoporto (era passato  meno di un mese dagli attentati) e per aver provveduto lei stessa a prenotare per noi un Taxi-van che si è rilevato una scelta azzeccata. Durante il soggiorno è stata sempre facilmente raggiungibile tramite Airbnb App. L'appartamento è esattamente come presentato: piacevole curato nei dettagli e tranquillo (non si sentono rumori dalla strada). Essendo noi due famiglie (5 adulti e 4 ragazzi) la possibilità di avere ognuno un appartamento con relativo bagno è stata molto positiva. L'unico appunto riguarda i letti che essendo alla francese (d'altronde siamo a Parigi!) non sono molto grandi: in particolare i divani letto sono adatti a persone non molto alte (alla fine ci ho dormito io con mio figlio minore). Il quartiere è molto tranquillo e vicino a diverse mete tipiche: 10 minuti da Place de La Republique 15 min da Mont Martre 20 min dal Louvre. Insomma siamo tutti molto soddisfatti della scelta fatta e sicuramente l'appartamento ha contribuito in modo decisivo alla buona riuscita della nostra vacanza a Parigi.

2787020,261801962,2018-05-07,99150922,Anna,We had an amazing time staying at Elodie's studio! The location was wonderful (safe so close to the metro and big tourist spots nice cafes and grocery markets) and the space was very cozy and comfortable. Especially with two beds (the loft bed and the pull out couch) my boyfriend and I had plenty of space to sleep! The kitchen was very helpful as well for cooking all our meals. Would definitely stay here again if we're in the area!

26301343,467450818,2019-06-10,49940968,Bill,(Relatively) spacious living & dinning area. Love the big couch which could easily accommodate one adult sleeping on it. Decent and safe neighborhood with okay proximity to subway stations. You can easily find restaurants and grocery stores around. Wash machine didn’t work. Bed smelled really funny.
34961959,493818784,2019-07-23,248003204,Ngai,We love this apartment and to be living in such beautiful apartment is like a dream came true. Stunning stylish tidy and lovely. And a very cultural family and you could start a little study from the material in the apartment if you want!
717376,19326293,2014-09-10,19668638,Marla Joy,Eleonor was a fantastic host! We had a very warm welcoming. Her apartment was small but comfortable. She had made it very cozy and we had everything we needed. And the location was amazing! We stayed there for five days and we can’t think about a better place for a visit to Paris. It’s in the middle of the Quatier Latin with Notre Dame just around the corner and near the Metro station St Michel. So it’s a perfect location for visiting Paris. We are very thankful!
36758819,507960784,2019-08-12,165671359,Mark,Cool apartment in Batignolles easy walk to city centre. Close to metro. Loved it thanks

2449295,32451395,2015-05-18,23559198,John,Christophe was very welcoming and our stay was not at all awkward despite sharing the apartment. The location is great for morning coffee with the locals outside the church or a stroll through the magnificent Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. There is a large market just up the road on Fridays and Sundays too.
21609919,335096368,2018-10-11,196386222,Hiromi,地下鉄の駅からすぐの素敵なｱﾊﾟｰﾄﾒﾝﾄ｡お二人ともﾌﾚﾝﾄﾞﾘｰでわからないことなど親切に教えて下さいました｡お部屋も可愛くてとても快適に過ごせました★
14893233,158765903,2017-06-08,124181593,Ivan,We were happy to visit Paris and were happy to live in this studio. The studio is very comfortable and beautiful. We liked the vintage furniture and the window. Also thanks for the good shower comfortable bed and excellent service.
16940749,149611395,2017-05-05,94379595,Michael,This is an excellent room in a fantastic location walking distance to Notre Dame the Latin Quarter.  If you don't want to walk the Metro is a block away as are many buses.  Claude is very kind attentive and helpful.  There are great places to eat just out the door and Les Jardin Des Plantes across the street in which to walk.  
3582066,221348276,2017-12-26,151566567,Claire,What a wonderful flat and easy communication with the responsive hosts. They were flexible and helpful. We loved the neighbourhood and getting everywhere we wanted to go was so easy. The kitchen was great and functional for making meals. Such a stylish space everything appeared as photographed in advertisement good wifi connection comfortable bed and very clean! We would stay here again and recommend to friends. Pack light! The stairs up are steep and plenty.
37561282,544128281,2019-10-09,288177861,Eric,Le séjour à été géniale !
1711246,438590791,2019-04-17,84866934,Alison,Arno was really helpful before our trip answering questions I had about Paris. The day we were due to arrive there was a problem with the apartment (a leak) but Arno found us somewhere else to stay - somewhere brand new! It was in a similar location - very close to the metro and great restaurants/shops etc. The apartment was stylish clean the beds were comfortable and we were able to sleep very well. Even though we didn’t stay in this exact apartment listed here I think it would be great because Arno seems to be really enthusiastic about being an Airbnb host and providing a good experience. We followed Arno’s restaurant recommendations and had an amazing well priced lunch nearby. Highly recommended.
7166680,69117389,2016-04-09,33436455,Alexandra,Je suis resté trois semaines dans cet appart'. La chambre et le reste de l'appartement sont super confortables et idéalement situé près du métro Karine et Olavo sont très arrangeants et sympathiques ! Séjour au top ! 
12443071,228849627,2018-01-21,167884749,Chloe,Very Nice place although lots of stairs with no elevator. Not good if you have large bags! But other than that amazing space.
21020472,437788456,2019-04-15,130255400,SongYi,호스트 덕분에 파리에서 편안하게 여행할 수 있었어요! 침실도 깨끗하고 인테리어도 예뻤어요. 호스트 분이 친절하고 파리 여행 일정이나 가는 방법들을 설명해주셔서 좋았어요. 조식도 원하는 시간에 먹을 수 있고 수제쨈이랑 바게트가 완전 맛있었어요! 다시 와도 묵고싶은 숙소입니다. 위치도 에펠탑이랑 가까워서 1일 1에펠 할 수 있어요. 파리오면 무조건 여기 숙소 추천합니다!
3103414,54122452,2015-11-16,20646855,Jorge,On the evening of 13 Novembre 2015 I was with Airbnb colleagues at Rotonde about one kilometer from the Bataclan incident. We stayed inside the restaurant for many hours until it felt safe to leave. It was such a terrible tragedy -- and yet at the same time we saw many many people caring for one another making sure other people were safe. Two of my Airbnb colleagues came with me to Caroline's place that same night because it was the safest thing to do. Caroline's place was indeed one of the safest Airbnb places to be. The next day my colleague played Caroline's keyboard while I recited socio-political poetry as we jammed and tried to process what happened the night before. Despite the horrible events that colored part of my Paris experience (working the Airbnb Open 2015) I am grateful to have had such a comforting safe place to be in. Thank you Caroline your place was a refuge during a time of crisis. Finally I would like to encourage all of us to continue educating and learning from one another and to continue caring for one another. Liberté égalité fraternité!
13390480,195410136,2017-09-19,48517364,Eric,Wonderful base to explore Paris from. Had all the essentials and Yankel was great in communicating through the entire process.
6764458,150487120,2017-05-08,87032087,Gerard,Beautiful apartment on 3rd floor of a traditional Paris townhouse.... packs a lot of modern features in but not cramped.  This is the quieter end of Ille S Louis 5 minutes walk from the link to the Ille de la citee. Super. Keep fit with tose stairs!.
5922871,50802673,2015-10-14,31821221,Julie Anne,The apartment was a dream. Clean tastefully decorated on one of the loveliest streets in the Marais. We hope to go back and stay again. Perfect for a couple or small family like ours. This place is steps from the best shopping in the city gorgeous parks and wonderful museums and restaurants.
8252773,82735108,2016-06-29,71350484,Camillo,"Stanza in appartamento accogliente e giusta. Host simpatici accoglienti e affettuosi. Appartamento condiviso con host. Zona comoda ai mezzi di comunicazione come metrò  e bus.

21466110,221105572,2017-12-25,128698034,Patrice,Bon emplacement tranquille et commode.
22857395,544856202,2019-10-11,116466183,Katy,Julieta's place was absolutely beautiful and one-of-a kind.  Perfectly located in Le Marais and a very large place with a beautiful outside terrace.  Julieta was very sweet and helpful in getting us set up and providing recommendations on where to go.  The only thing to note is that there was no shower curtain the bathroom so we took baths every day instead of showers. When in Paris!
23097057,294507419,2018-07-22,71727128,Emmanuel,Manon's apartment is located in one of the best neighborhoods of Paris. One can find lots of places to eat to drink and to buy groceries really nearby. Manon is always reachable to answer all your questions. My wife my three years old son and myself liked a lot Manon's apartment despite the fact that it can get noisy during the night. There are several touristic spots within a walking distance. Without doubts I recommend this place.
2610613,177029289,2017-08-01,55007680,Ria,Maryse's studio was in a perfect location with great food drinks and the Eiffel Tower a short walk away.  She was a gracious and helpful host. Thank you Maryse for our wonderful stay in Paris!
11940008,105225944,2016-09-30,23587631,Mary Ann,The apartment is bright and airy at a magnificent location steps from a bakery grocery wine store and multiple cafes and restaurants.  It's also a quick 5 minute walk to several metro lines.  We stayed during September so the outside deck was fabulous especially with coffee in the mornings.  There are two bedrooms the larger of which is away from the street allowing for very quiet sleep.  It really is a rare jewel.  The host was super responsive to our questions and we would most definitely stay there again.  
10505664,480280456,2019-07-02,128864202,Matthew,Gilian was an excellent communicator. His apartment is in an ideal location in historic Paris. The apartment was not completely clean upon our arrival which was a little disappointing. However the cleaning person came later and the apartment was very nice once it was clean. The pictures idealized the size and brightness of the apartment. Overall the pros outweighed the cons.
24225215,333377401,2018-10-07,28640460,Crystal,Amazing location super stylish and superb communication! Perfect Parisian Airbnb for young travelers visiting with a group looking to be close to the nightlife of Le Marais!
192162,6239004,2013-08-05,6441626,Sabina,My boyfriend and I just came back from a one-week trip to Paris and Cristina’s studio was absolutely perfect! It was our first time using Airbnb so we were a bit nervous but our experience has turned us into believers. Is the studio small? Sure so go with someone you are close with. Will you have to hike up to the 6th floor every day? Yes but so what? It will probably be your only form of exercise (besides walking) while there and if you plan to eat as many croissants cheese and chocolates as I did your arteries will appreciate it. It was very clean the bed was comfortable and even though it was warm and the studio does not have air conditioning the room remained a comfortable temperature. If you are high maintenance and your vacations entail hanging out a lot inside your posh hotel room and then maybe this isn't the right apartment for you. If you like a clean practical place in a charming building and great location near locals but close to touristy things as well and prefer to spend your time outside taking in the city this is it! People the location of this apartment is conveniently located to amazing restaurants wine bars bakeries sights – you name it! We spent many of our days walking a mere 2 minutes to the Seine River and parking ourselves with our wine and picnic goods next to the locals and admired the beautiful Notre Dame with a magical sunset setting in the background. The location is truly unmatched and the price was very reasonable. Although we unfortunately did not meet Cristina and her husband (they were on vacation) obtaining keys was seamless. The hosts provided lots of recommendations (many of which we took them up on and we were not sorry we did!) and the communication with them was stellar. We can’t recommend this 5th Heaven studio enough!. WHEN I come back to Paris I would hope to come back to this lovely studio provided it isn't sold out ;)

Juste une petite remarque pour ceux qui voudraient faire la tour Eiffel à pied.. comptez un peu plus que les 10 minutes indiquées dans l'annonce ;) Donnant sur une cour intérieure l’appartement est en plus agréablement au calme. Nous recommandons vivement ce logement pour une visite à Paris et remercions encore nos hôtes pour l'accueil chaleureux :)"
19774165,296626075,2018-07-26,176374796,Molly,Pascal’s apartment was the perfect place for my family’s trip to Paris! It was in such a great location it felt like we were actual Parisians instead of just tourists. Only a block from the metro it was very easy to travel all throughout Paris and see all of the sites on our list. Not only was it a great location but it was also well decorated and very clean inside. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who’s traveling to Paris!!

The location was perhaps the best area in Paris close to cosy cafes outstanding art galleries and walking distance to the Louvres the Musee d'orsay Notre Dame cathedral le Jardine de Luxemborg and most other central Paris landmarks.
Isabelle and her family were welcoming and helpful in orienting us to the neighborhood and made us feel very much at home on arrival.
We always enjoyed ""coming home"" after our days out and now miss our home-away-from-home.
We hope that Isabelle's place will be available for our next visit to Paris."

The location is perfectly situated for Gare du Nord Mon Martre Sacre Ceour and an accessible metro station. And the neighbourhood is just wonderful - full of interesting restaurants bars and shops. The apartment is high spec luxurious and so peaceful - we had a perfectly uninterrupted sleep all night thanks to the fact that it is set back from the street. There's no need to look any further for Paris - we will be coming again and again.

Also the environment had its french charming flair with its small bars directly next to the apartment with a very nice view to the Eiffel tower! Would come back every time again.

3715016,53617935,2015-11-10,10751584,Yael,"Guillaume was a superb host.  Quick to respond and very communicative.  He helped me figure out the best way to get to/from his place left spot-on recommendations for things to do and enjoy in the area and even left a nice bottle of wine because he couldn't meet me at the apartment upon check-in.  

The apartment itself is wonderfully located in the Marais.  Easy walk to Picasso Museum great shopping and homey restaurants and fun bars.  Also a nice stroll to other arrondissements if you like longer walks -- I walked over to Notre Dame St Germaine and on another day to the Louvre and Orangerie.

As long as you are fit enough to climb 6 floors of windy stairs I would hands down recommend Guillaume's place."

very good location though. Price is absolutely too high for this kind of apartment.

35304473,526519455,2019-09-09,141929,Lisa,"Lea’s place is in a great neighborhood with plenty of bars and restaurants.  Lea is really nice and offered lots of great suggestions. 
The problem for me was that when I arrived the host and her sister were smoking in the kitchen just outside my bedroom. I am sensitive to smoke smells and the smoke remained in the house and bedding. I opened the windows for air and it was loud all night making it hard to sleep. Also the apartment is in the 2nd floor and there is no elevator (with an older narrow staircase) so that would be good to know. I decided to leave early for these reasons— but if these are not issues for you then it is a cute place in a great neighborhood."

Nous aurions pu nous faire agresser. Sans compter que les equipements son bas de gamme et ne fonctionnent pas. A notre arrivée il y avait des traces de pizzas sur le sol et sur la table. Les draps n'etaient pas changés avec les traces des hotes precedents dessus...

7299412,54243342,2015-11-17,42394070,Sabrina,Nathalie was helpful. The area is a really good place to be. The flat is small and basic but we liked it. You would want to know each other fairly well to share it. The second bed is a mattress on the floor and the bathroom isn't very private. We really enjoyed being there. 
8419886,83403336,2016-07-02,67853499,Allyson,The Studio Apartment was well priced according to it's size and in a good location close to attractions restaurants supermarkets etc.  Salvatore was responsive to our email requests and overall we enjoyed our stay.
8260345,126116550,2017-01-09,78223998,Jiyeon,"First of all Mia was a nice host. She responded really fast to our inquiries and came to the place to welcome us and give information about the place even our flight was delayed. Also place was right in front of the river. So every morning and night we could enjoy beautiful scenaries of the river. 
Few drawbacks were that elevators were broken very often so we had to go up the stairs most of the time. We used elevators less than 10 time during our 6 day stay. Second thing was the noise. Constructions were going on so every morning we woke up with sounds of engineering work. As we are tourists we were out most of the time but it would be better if were told that constructions are going on during our stay. "

9775372,73451621,2016-05-08,9204919,Carli,We absolutely loved this apartment- seriously if we could we'd move in! It's beautifully decorated comfortable and it's location is incredible! About a 3 min walk to at both of the Metro stations a quick shop next to your front door that is open almost all the time a 5 min walk to a grocery store and the best less than a 10 min walk to the Sacre Coeur and the most breathtaking views of Paris. It's on a busy street which is great for access but could be a bit noisy due to traffic but honestly that did not bother us one bit. Steph was an amazing host met us and showed us the ropes before leaving us with a few good tips on where to shop. Easy to reach great with communication. I would stay nowhere else in Paris!

9129652,59570937,2016-01-12,44935657,Gigi,Great place and cannot recommend it any higher! Literally in the heart of Paris and around 1-2 min to the closest metro station.Close to everything and there are a lot of restaurants/cafes around. The hosts not only gave my friend and I detailed guidance to come to the house and but also picked us up in the exit of the metro station. Can't be more grateful than that! They are just super nice and helpful. Though the room is a little bit small but you can find everything you need there (kitchen/bathroom/packable bed/pillows).  Recommended for anyone who's travelling to Paris! 
21235720,227557254,2018-01-15,96298823,Ariana,Cristina’s place was great! Her place is close to the metro and within walking distance to the Louvre Montmartre and great restaurants. Her communication was spot on and she was very helpful with anything that we needed. Cristina even took time out of her day to walk around the neighborhood and show us around. The two story apartment is very chic and in a secured building. We would recommend this place!

298548,5884470,2013-07-21,6328407,Stephen,Just as so many have said... if you're going to be in the city why not have a view?  Remi's son Simon met us when we arrived and was very gracious and Remi stopped by with a congratulatory bottle of Champagne (we were in Paris for my birthday) and a visit.  It was warm while we were in Paris but there was always a breeze 20 stories up and it was always comfortable.  Highly recommend!  Thanks Remi!

4648955,73926419,2016-05-11,54797412,Rochelle,The apartment was perfect for our week in Paris. The location was absolutely ideal . We were able to walk to most of the major attractions in Paris or take the Metro which was just a short distance from the apartment. There was also a great variety of restaurants to choose from as well as bars. Lilian was also very helpful and stayed in touch throughout our trip. I would highly recommend staying here if you find yourself in Paris. I can't wait to come back!

26298753,433888235,2019-04-07,97938799,Chamonix Location,Appartement spacieux proche de la gare un peu bruyant. Le gros point négatif est l'équipement de la cuisine. Il manque beaucoup de basiques comme des verres à vin un plat à four des casseroles une bouilloire une essoreuse à salade un grille pain… Sinon l'arrivée et le départ avec le système de boite à clé est très pratique la communication est facile par email.  Nous n'avons pas rencontré Sophie mais avons eu affaire à une conciergerie.

2248161,109820038,2016-10-23,42343351,Yun Lu,"Julien is extremely friendly and easy to communicate with. Although he was unable to be around during our stay he kept connecting with us via messaging to ensure that everything is okay. 

The apartment is modern and spacious for two! It has fully equipped kitchen and there is always hot water in the shower! It feels really like a home away from home! 

The location is extremely near Montmarte area and hence some may find is disconcerting. When I first arrived at the station I was slightly uncomfortable but Julien has explained to us earlier about the people loitering around the area. They are actually harmless so nothing to worry about. We got used to it after the first two nights. We felt extremely safe in the apartment.

The apartment is also extremely convenient 3 min walk from Barbes Rocherart station and also 10 min walk from Gare Du Nord. It's only a 45 minutes journey from airport! 

All in all we enjoyed our stay there and Julien is really a great host! Will stay here again when we come to Paris in future. "

However a few things to note is that there are no lifts to the first level so you will need to carry your luggage up. Also unfortunately for us the drainage in the shower was not working properly and hence 2 minutes into showering the water spills out of the shower into the bathroom floor. Nonetheless we enjoyed our stay and the lovely house made up for it."

Some drinks in the fridge and nespresso capsules are provided for convenience. Very well appointed bathrooms and kitchen. 

The flooring is original floor so it makes some sounds when walking on but this wasn’t a big issue for me. There could be some noise from outside on the weekend since it’s near rue St Honore. 

Overall I had a great experience and enjoyed staying in this apartment very much. Highly recommended."

2860869,130197968,2017-02-05,6684792,Ken,"Marine's place is located in a really convenient area of the city. It's a few blocks from a lively street full of restaurants and shops that specialise in wine cheeses meats etc. but the street itself is quiet. We stocked up on nice French food and had breakfast in her flat each morning before starting our day.

The shower and internet were both great by the way. I always worry about these things with Airbnb stays so I figured I'd just say that for this!

Marine's place is close to excellent public transport links but it was also easy to walk down to the Notre Dame or up the Pantheon which is literally 1 minute away.

Marine was really flexible with our checkin and checkout circumstances which I really appreciated and was quick to reply to all our questions."

Washer dryer dishwasher espresso machine good WiFi elevator. Great communication with and special touches from the hosts. The apartment is super convenient. We walked to Luxembourg Gardens Sainte-Chappelle the Picasso Museum and to the Batobus which was very close and took us down the Seine to the Louvre Eiffel Tower and the Musee d'Orsay. The food choices nearby are magnificent. Cafes yes but also Boulangerie frommagerie organic grocery store -- and that market! We were here for a week and wish we could have stayed longer."

168652,7970510,2013-10-10,8921462,Masha,Elsa was a fantastic host--her apartment is lovely and filled with light. It's a good spot if you want to stay in Montmartre and quick to connect on the Metro via Lines 4 & 12. There's a cafe on the corner that has good coffee in the morning and a bar for the remainder of the day which is always handy!
9194001,367564499,2019-01-05,21222047,Carol,Their apartment is great! We loved our stay.  It is very well located close to boulangeries markets  restaurants bars and a metro station. It is also at a walking distance from the Eiffel Tour Les Invalides and several other tourist attractions. The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures. The interior decoration is beautiful and the beds are comfortable. The hosts are the best!! When we arrived we found a bottle of Champagne chocolate slippers and other treats welcoming us. We loved it! I would strongly recomend this apartment!
3718164,452944252,2019-05-14,28781854,Spencer,This AIRBNB was located on a very popular street close to public transport. Situated atop 5 flights of stairs (no elevator) was a cute little flat with a larger bedroom than we could tell from the pictures. The space was bright clean and full of all the basic cooking essentials. The balcony was a plus as it provided a wonderful outdoor space to enjoy. We would rent again.

1158033,7434778,2013-09-20,7713899,Jinsun,I stayed there for two nights with my mom her friend and her 10-year old daughter. The flat was clean well-equipped and close to major sightseeing venues - thus satisfactory to my guests of varying generations! Pascal was a professional host and promptly responded to my inquiries. This flat is adjacent to a flower shop whose owner is super-friendly and to a cafe that has good selections for food and drink. Should I visit Paris again I'd like to stay here again although it seems competitive to reclaim this spot :)
8621716,134817769,2017-03-01,4763658,Martijn,Our stay was very pleasant as the apartment is perfectly located and well maintained in the very heart of Paris in the Marais. It is a very charming place with high ceilings and lots of daylight. The communication with the owner went friendly and smoothly he was very helpful. Definitely a place to stay again!

9912144,171952008,2017-07-19,101662572,Yuanyuan,Nice and very helpful host. Great location walking distance to a few famous spots restaurants and groceries stores.
6431439,343884071,2018-11-02,81513051,Philippe,Thanks Barbara for allowing us to stay in your apartment for the last 7 days. We had a great time visiting museums and eating out in local restaurants. The apartment was very comfortable for us (4 adults and a child) with lots of space for everybody (3 bedrooms a big living room and separate dinning room kitchen and bathroom). The location is really good as it is closed to the Metro station and the Paris Center (Le Marais / Chatelet) is only a 20min walk from the apartment. We had a great time and we will recommend your apartment to anybody who wants to explore the French Capital. Thanks again.
22255266,474373248,2019-06-23,155829103,Alex,Clémentine is a wonderful host. The apartment is very clean beautiful well-kept and a great find for Paris - close to the metro the neighborhood is lively and the amenities are great. It felt like staying at a close friend's place.

restaurants around. Although on the main road the room was very quiet. Large windows let in lots of natural light "

2535066,239589499,2018-03-02,102214289,Daniel,We very much enjoyed our stay at Alexis' apartment. The apartment is spacious with plenty of living space in addition to the bedroom. Alexis was very understanding after our flight home was cancelled and thanks to his speedy responses we were able to stay for two extra days.
6702752,48212339,2015-09-24,39372086,Nicolae-Costin,"Sara was very kind to us and let us change the date of arrival - Many thanks Sara! I also have to say that she trust us as we were new on airbnb and had no feedback yet.
The apartment is large for a Parisian one corresponding to description.  It is very close to Rue de Commerce supermarkets (Monoprix and Carrefour City) McDonalds and metro (La motte picquet grenelle and Duplexin). In front of the apartment you will find on Sundays and Wednesdays a huge free market with lot of fruits and food to chose. Also if you are looking for parking place there is free parking between Saturday 19:00 to Monday 8:00 or on neoparking - I found a cheap place on Pullman parking close to Eiffel Tower. Have a nice trip in Paris!"
13374253,426234836,2019-03-20,44496310,Lisa,The location of the apartment is great! You can have every morning fresh baguette just a few meters away. Also for evening some nice restaurants and bars can be found. The communication was fast and easy! The Check-In was by ourselves but with the good description it was no problem at all! One little thing: the fridge was out of order. However the highlight of course the little balcony in the bedroom! No better morning could be imagined! :)
25541071,532090172,2019-09-19,1739237,Manon,"Très bon séjour dans ce logement investi au cours d’un séjour professionnel de 4 jours. Parfait pour rayonner dans Paris (bus tram métro 6 et 8) au calme dans une cour intérieure confort avec trois pièces dont une salle de bain neuve. 
Anna est très réactive et arrangeante pour que le séjour se déroule au mieux. Draps serviette à disposition. Monoprix juste en bas et chouettes librairies à côté..!

1158033,17683610,2014-08-16,16949447,Jaime,"We spent four wonderful days in Paris (me my wife and one kid). 
I would say that the strongest points of Pascal apartment are the location (you have supermarkets restaurants bakeries Tolbiac metro station etc.) and the kindness of the host (we didn't meet Pascal but the guy who receive us was very kind). However there are few less positive points concerning the conditions of this apartment. The apartment needs more attention concerning the cleanliness mainly the kitchen pieces (e.g. dishes glasses); the bathroom needed also a better attention concerning their cleanliness (which is very small) if you stay more than two days it is better to bring some extra towels. The apartment has also very natural light; however since the sunrise opens it is impossible to close any curtains because the roof window doesn’t have it. The sofa it isn't very comfortable to sleep more than 3/4 nights."

Nous reviendrons sans aucun doute l'année prochaine ce fut un immense plaisir !"

20071766,188640141,2017-08-30,41919395,Jeff,Benjamin's apartment was excellent!  However we happened to arrive during a cooler time in Paris.  Our last day there was hot!  And I would not have been happy if it had been hot our whole stay.  THERE'S NO AIR CONDITIONING but this is how it is in most places that are not expensive hotels.  Just be aware of this.  There is no elevator and you will have to climb 8 floors with your luggage.  That's 107 STEPS up and down! But you get use to it.  It is well situated between metro stops CADET and GRAND BOULEVARD which is nice.  It's also just across from a small store FRANPRIX and a LAUNDROMAT although there is a washing machine and drying rack in the room.   There are great choices in the neighborhood to eat drink and hang out!  GREAT LOCATION!!!!   Another WARNING:  IF YOU ARE A TALL OR FAT PERSON YOU MAY NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE HERE.  The bathroom is small and there's no shower only a tub against the roof that YOU HAVE TO SIT IN.  If you are taller than 6 foot 2 inches than you may be ducking in the dining area from a wooden cross beam.  The main bed is very comfortable but the 2nd bed is very uncomfortable.  The apartment looks just like the photos.  It is a very very charming place.  I loved looking out across the roof tops and having the breeze through the apartment when all the windows were open.  HOWEVER it is decorated to have a certain look like a museum and therefore not a very comfortable place.  If you plan on staying awhile you will begin to wish you had a place to put up your feet and relax.  This place feels like you will break something in it.  But its charm makes up for that comfort and you get use to it.  The WIFI WORKS GREAT and makes up for not having a TV.  Everything considered I would recommend this place as long as you come when it's cool.  Benjamin took a while to respond to messages but when he did he was always considerate.  Thanks Benjamin!

2449004,83349751,2016-07-02,47913545,Maria,We had a wonderful time in this loft with our family of 4. The loft was small but we never felt cramped for the 5 days we were there. The loft had all the amenities we needed and all were in great working order. We would highly recommend this location for its convenience to the subway and easy access to all the necessities we needed. Matthieu was very welcoming and a big help in giving us a good oversight into the area and into Paris in general. He was very accessible and very willing to assist with questions.
36765864,537751469,2019-09-29,244949941,Djason,Super nuit passé chez deborah! très sympa et au petit soins! merci pour tout
11884659,150564801,2017-05-08,10732154,Louise,Everything was fantastic. The appartment is really cosy and super pretty. There are two terraces with plants all over which are fantastic in nice weather. The appartment is situated in a lush courtyard which makes it quiet and calm. Close to metro and bus which goes into center Paris. Although it is also walkable. The area is nice with lots of cafes and shops. Anne is a perfect host pleasant and helpful. Recommend. 
23302767,338639170,2018-10-20,189047531,Rie,Really enjoyed the city life of Paris thanks to Laurence!
18258074,201860361,2017-10-09,15595713,Luis,Very well decorated flat very welcoming and very well located. We did appreciate very much the bottle of wine and the bottle of juice the host left for us. Definitely recommended.
5345708,82810758,2016-06-29,12509698,George,Nathalie was very welcoming and helpful. She gave us many useful suggestions about what to see and do and how to get around. The room and apartment are very comfortable. The neighbourhood is very interesting and scenic. We very much enjoyed our stay.
7816836,295367912,2018-07-23,42145429,Angelina,"This is a stylish flat conveniently located to the Menilmontant station in Paris. The flat has a small kitchen that we used for boiling water in the mornings (coffee and french press available) using plates for breakfast and silverware. The fridge is located in the bathroom due to limited space but has plenty of room for storing wine and food.

The living room was our favorite area to use in the mornings for breakfast and at night to drink wine and listen to the red radio (great radio station!). The windows open to allow some breeze to come in with nice light in the mornings. The bar downstairs can be a bit loud at night so we closed the bedroom window to reduce noise. The beds are not the most comfortable but they are fine just for a few nights of sleeping. If you have an extra pillow to bring it could help!

Everything here is clean and safe! Overall we had a great stay in Paris!"

Simple street door entry with code then 1 small flight of stairs and your at the front door.  Easily accessible.  Large windows in living room and bedroom for abundant natural light.  Spacious flat.  Great kitchen if you're one to cook.  Large bathroom.  VERY VERY cozy bedroom with plenty of space for your luggage.  The entire flat is decorated very nicely.  You can tell there is love put into this place.  All in all this place is 10 out of 10.  ENJOY! 
19434928,488440972,2019-07-15,238819670,Kim,This is an amazing house in a grade location.  There is plenty of space and the outdoor garden was a great highlight.  It is very close to the metro and supermarkets. We had a great stay.

868765,9637211,2014-01-04,3608082,Colette,Mathilde and Jean-Pierre's home is absolutely fabulous!  The location could not be more perfect for exploring Paris and the home itself is an artistic treat.  Our hosts went above and beyond to make us comfortable and to make our time in Paris easy and fulfilling.  We REALLY enjoyed meeting them and spending a little time with them.  I hope to revisit in the future!
5775457,84988034,2016-07-10,38400097,Cameron,My wife and I felt right at home. Anaïs had every detail hashed out for us - our arrival nearby grocery stores metro stops etc. which made it very easy to get comfortable with our surroundings. The apartment is bigger than we were expecting and is close to everything. Couldn't be more pleased with our stay and we would love to stay there again!
14680573,171867598,2017-07-19,4662129,Nara,My 18 year old son and I enjoyed a wonderful week in Paris staying in Ghislaine's beautiful and stylish apartment. Waking up each day on the 4th floor with views of Montmartre streets was such a delight. The area has lots of character with everything you need right on the doorstep. Metro stations for lines 12 and 4 are very close by. Although we didn't meet Ghislaine in person her communication before and during our stay was very prompt friendly and helpful. She left us information and recommendations for the the local area and organised Airbnb 'sitters' for checking in and out which went smoothly. We can't wait to return!
497601,215906305,2017-12-02,18020935,Ali,"The location is amazing! Quiet street close to metro markets restaurants and Montmartre. This area is cleaner and feels more like a locals' neighbourhood than central Paris. I was worried about the stairs after reading the reviews but I didn't find them bad at all more like walking up stairs in an apartment building. While the windows facing the courtyard/bike stands were partially frosted I would have felt more comfortable with curtains.
Don't forget to bring towels ( tea towels/foot towels/enough toilet paper also not provided)."
17874457,202905229,2017-10-13,27985110,Sona,I cant describe what an amazing experience we had at Herve's studio. Location is the best in Paris the apartment is very neat and comfortable will everything you need for an enjoyable and careless stay. The host was very warm responsive and intelligent man. He welcomed us gave us some tips regarding the studio and the location as well. If you see the place is available just book it immediately! Thank you Herve.
263044,261299666,2018-05-06,63745696,Michel,"We stayed for two weeks in Raphaelles apartment and loved every minute of it. It's super comfortable and the kitchen is great. The location is close to a big metro-station (2min) and there are a lot of shops nearby. It's sometimes a little noisy in the night because of the street nearby. But nothing worse - you got to expect that in paris.

I would recommend it to anyone!"
15297775,455052162,2019-05-19,245151141,Kevin,"This is a fantastic apartment so close to the Eiffel Tower and other tourist areas. The apartment is very safe secure and clean. You’ll love the view from the apartment and the coziness of the apartment. Freddy was very helpful and accommodating to our travel schedule.

The bus stop is right out front of the apartment and the subway is just a block away very easy to get to. If your traveling from the airport take the Direct route bus Eiffel . It will drop you off down the street a very short distance away from the apartment."

The apartment is really cozy and fully furnished. 400m away there is a department store and carrefour can go to buy something easily. Maya kindly offered us a cot and his father bought new spatula very kind and hospitable. I would lile to live in her apartment if I travel to Paris again.

8366439,292115586,2018-07-17,32932532,Rm,This is a great apartment for couples friends or families with kids. It is adjacent to Butte aux Cailles which is a hidden gem in Paris. Very convenient location near metro line and within walking distance to Denfert Rochereau Moufettard and many other tourist attractions. The apartment is spacious and full of light. Because of cross ventilation and large windows in all rooms there is a nice breeze. The kitchen is extremely well-appointed and has all the basic things you might need. We enjoyed going to the market on nearby August Blanqi 3 days a week and preparing food in the apartment. We were in Paris for a work trip. We found the internet wi-fi in the apartment to be very reliable. Check in process was efficient. The host was gracious and very responsive to all our questions. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

20030333,180769617,2017-08-11,137287631,Angzhi,The studio is just located in the very centre of Paris facing the Louvre Museum across the River Senie. The famous Cafe de Flore is also with 10 minutes walk. The studio is well-equipped with all daily appliances except microwave oven. Another little defect is that there is no curtains in the bedroom. But considering the view of River Senie in the drawing room the fairly comfortable beddings the clean and modern bathroom the excellent kitchen room with all cookers this exquisite studio is perfect enough.

728737,480180085,2019-07-02,100708342,Vanessa,"As many fellow reviewers before me had mentioned there are some differences between the pictures and the flat as it is now. Let me say that I understand decor can and/or needs to change. Certainly keeping 'linens' on tables and nightstands wouldn't last with multiple guests over time. New photos of the property would help eliminate this main discrepancy. That being said it's a perfectly fine place for 1-2 people if you just need a simple place to stay in this part of Paris (and don't mind a winding staircase (about 4 floors))! 

Unfortunately my arrival coincided with  the end of the Saharan heat-wave in June-July and Pride weekend and due to both of these occurrences was disappointed in my first few hours in Paris because of the check-in/arrival at the flat.

Prune uses a Concierge service which I had not yet experienced in my AirBnb travels. After this experience I can't say I'm impressed with the Concierge service. The host to check me in didn't show (her reasons: due to the heat/travel/broken subway/busy Pride weekend) and the place had not been cleaned from the prior guests. It took a couple of hours to get it all sorted out but it did with Prune emailing me directly which I appreciated. 

PROS: comfortable bed great shower pressure well equipped kitchen (although I didn't have a need to use any of it) a wonderfully lit bathroom with bright daylight and a big mirror above the sink the wonderful smell of the bakery below to wake you (if you keep the windows open) and a portable fan which was a lifesaver!

CONS: pillows not so great only a heavy comforter (which was too much for the heat-wave nights I was experiencing) and a very slow-draining shower (couldn't use that great shower pressure I mentioned above). 

Improvements: it could use a luggage stand (the small table isn't suitable to hold an open suitcase) a sheet for the bed a simple throw rug on the floor next to the bed (so you can dust your feet off before climbing into bed) and maybe some hooks in the bathroom to hang wet towels.

Overall it is a quiet neighborhood and I felt safe as a single woman staying there and suited my needs for a basic flat."
890465,52717534,2015-11-01,43680173,Malinda,We found the apartment to be very charming and factual of the pictures.  Centrally located with a convenient grocery next door and a delicious bakery which we enjoyed.  Short stroll to Metro and Eiffel Tower.  Would book this location again.  Olivier was very responsive easy to coordinate with.  Easy to fall in love in Paris.

1580590,35770143,2015-06-22,11847885,Noemi,Vivienda muy bien ubicada en el centro de París con una parada de metro a 50 m. El piso estaba muy sucio se observa una limpieza por encima muy poco menaje (platos vasos no tenía tostadora para el pan). Pero lo más importante es que la conexion a internet es muy mala no funciona con lo que si quereis ver email no podreis tampoco podreis descargar fotos ni ver tv online. El anfitrion apareció el último dia a por las llaves es decir dos minutos. Total de puntuación un 5.

2871271,452927940,2019-05-14,180668887,Mary,Erwann’s place was conveniently located in a nice neighborhood. Pierre Hermès and Eric Kaser shops are within a few minutes of walking. He offered tips on restaurants to try and get in on us during our stay. We were out all day touring the city and enjoyed our stay very happy.
26618994,302281750,2018-08-05,182321474,Charlotte,"Amazing location couldn’t have been happier. 
It was very hot as in peak of summer the small fan supplied did a little but not much. 
Very clean and presentable picture perfect! 
Beware of the low ceiling upstairs a few head knocks here and there but gorgeous quaint little set up. 
David the AirBnB service guy was very gracious and patient with our very late arrival couldn’t be more appreciative of his time. 
Can recommend a two night stay was just perfect. "

19254784,268251503,2018-05-24,181964221,Chase,"Nice place to stay. Clean and comfortable. Really cool cabinets. Great kitchen and living room space for cooking having drinks or just hanging out.  Very nice shower 

 Unfortunately the  listing says that it has two bathrooms. This is a little misleading because I expected at least two toilets. It does not have to toilets but rather one room with a shower and sink and a second room with just a toilet. 

 Finally there were just a few images that were  displayed that I felt were inappropriate  and uncomfortable for guests"

11896814,293336556,2018-07-20,187015460,Tyler,My wife and I loved staying here. It was easy directions and a great place of rest in between exploring/site seeing. Omar was an excellent host. He responded immediately and showed great hospitality. When we checked in there was no toilet paper or soap so I messaged Omar and supposedly the cleaning person was new and must have forgotten to replace those items.. my wife and I went out for a bit and by the time we came home there was soap and toilet paper on the front door left my Omar. Great hospitality great location (full of young people and young bars) and the greatest city. Would definitely recommend!

2676700,24382110,2014-12-27,2043539,Laraba,We loved staying at Pierre's apartment. It was exactly as he described it in fact better. The light was fabulous large windows beautiful furniture comfy bed...our welcome note and bottle of wine was a lovely surprise. We had loads of good advice written about the neighbourhood hints for things in the apartment. We loved exploring the area eating and drinking locally and buying our Christmas meal in the market very near by. Our first Airbnb stay and we could not recommend it high enough. Thank you Pierre.

There is a lot of light and is very stylish. It has all you need for cooking and it is very clean. Even if it’s located in a lively area there is no noise as it is in a beautiful backyard.

Centrally located yet quiet spotlessly clean super well equipped (even a coffee machine with beans provided). Yann and his wife waited for us despite delay and gave us a warmhearted and thorough introduction to the apartment and gave us tips for going out in the beautiful Marais quarter. I don't think Airbnb gets any better than this! Thanks again!

The location is ideal the apartment is clean and spacious (for Paris) the cats are adorable and not too demanding and Eli went above and beyond to make us feel at home. This is a great value you won't find anywhere else in the city. Check-in and check-out were a breeze; I can't recommend this place enough. Merci Eli!

16542454,289325973,2018-07-12,4224764,Elizabeth,"Guests can expect a good location. But the studio is not as advertised. The flat is a box of small and potentially serious dangers: shower box involves climbing over 50 centimetres shower does not stay in one position tap comes off. In the kitchen there is just one old electric hob point tap is wobbly needing to be held to be turned on and off. The double bed is advertised as IN mezannine: it's just a double matters supported by a structure over the floor below; its claustrophobic I hit my head as there's no space to raise one's arm or to sit up. I grazed my chin on the steep narrow and sharp steps going to bed (I have photo). it advertises views on rooftops but theres no more than adjancent cheminees on view. It says two minutes from subway when it's 3 and a half blocks away on the 6th floor. The weather was too hot and the studio was a sauna box in the mattresss upstairs it was scalding even with window fully open. On the Sunday following the first sleepless night I bought a fan with it on I slept a bit. It's not what it is advertised. There was a water cut unadvisedly on Monday 8am-17pm. Again on Tuesday 8am-17pm. Remy returned two days pay - I am to receive 76% of what I paid over two days. It helps but Remy was neglectful of the good care of guests by claiming not to have noticed the water cut warning. I felt deceived. This turnished my holiday. The host was neglectful of guests welbeing. I believe host was aware that water was to be cut off during my stay. There was a notice on the board on ground floor and I spoke to the workers and the neighbours (knowing French was an asset). Works had started the previous Tuesday. Monday morning we had no water in the flat. Two days with no water 8am-5pm. Refund offered of £38.57 per day. I paid £44.87 per day. Difference is allegedly due to airB&B fees/tax. I have claimed the full refund at the very least and wait to hear from AirB&B.

180331,1479242,2012-06-14,2244408,Brian,The location is fantastic and felt like it was more of a local neighborhood within walking distance of the touristy things which was a great balance for us. The block is almost entirely for pedestrians minus the occasional taxi with many nice restaurants bars cafes wine & cheese shops nearby.  The apartment was nice clean and cozy. We only had one towel at the beginning but Alexandra responded quickly with a solution. We would recommend again!

24483494,323941873,2018-09-16,4959420,Rense,Constance's three piece apartment is cosy and small but well equipped for a lovely weekend in Paris! The location is great and because it is on the inside court it is very quiet at night. The hillside area of Montmartre is right in front of the door and it is full of small shops nice bars and good restaurants. Although it is quite touristic it is still very Parisien. We loved it.
468465,85930203,2016-07-14,21435198,Olivier,Nice place and well located with Metro at walking distance. The sofa bed does need to be replaced. Extremely noisy. Aside from this I would recommend the place.

8946914,75577455,2016-05-22,9038036,Ali,I can't imagine a better stay than at Delphine's place. We were 3 friends in Paris for a couple of days the house is located at the perfect spot - walking distance to anywhere in Marais or Bastille and close to metro stations. It was extremely quiet we felt safe all the time. The apertment is in a charming 17th century building overlooking a beautiful courtyard decorated beautifully so you really feel at home. It was extremely clean with all the appliances and towels etc ready. Delphine greeted us herself and gave us some insightful information about the area. The only downside for some people might be the fact that the apartment is located on the 3rd floor with no elevator though it wasn't a problem for us. Can't wait to come back and stay at Delphine's home again!
27972813,334473765,2018-10-09,117856551,Jeanie,Very stylish place in good location!
28377107,459323214,2019-05-27,103850729,Florence Et Christian,Saïd est très réactif et disponible. L'appartement est très bien situé et a beaucoup de charme. On s'y sent comme chez soi.
6978581,62345706,2016-02-14,50023507,Scott,"Meena and Manu's apprtment in Canal St Martin is a winner. The apartment is comfortable and stylish and is equipped with everything you could need. Entering inside the cobbled courtyard from the street via a heavy blue door is a peaceful calm space. The apartment overlooks the courtyard and is thererefore both extremely quiet and bright with its large opening windows. I couldn't think of a better place to stay in Paris.

We were met at the apartment by the cleaner who waited for us to arrive. She was a very warm and friendly host (sorry I did not pick up her name) who quickly showed us the features and amenities of the apartment (loved the easy to use espresso machine!). The communication and directions were perfect and it is short 5 - 10 minute walk to the Metro; or to the bus system which we often found more convenient and interesting than the Metro. 

This a great area from which to access Paris. It has all the shops and services you need and is a vibrant local neighbourhood. A couple of the many interesting shops we discovered included Ambrym a unique local clothing designer and artist just down the steps aound the corner. We also had dinner at a French influenced Indian restaurant alongside the canal recommended by Meena called ""Marcel"". Cool atmosphere and great flavours but ask for additional fresh chili if you like your spice. The canal had been drained and was undergoing maintenance cleaning during our stay - not a common event just unlucky timing - but it clearly would be a beautiful and romantic place to stroll. Gives us an excuse to go back! 

Paris is a city like no other when it comes to museums. If you like museums you will need no convincing but if you're not sure then push yourself a little. We used the 4-day Paris museum pass and 5-day transport pass. Brilliant! The information is well laid out in accompanying brochure; shortcut or skip queues and hop on and off trains and buses like a local; and it saved us a bundle.

28273412,492146683,2019-07-21,77169845,Jacqueline,Marco’s place is located in the center of everything! Very short walks to major sights. Location has a very cute courtyard and is on the same street as not only restaurants but also name brand stores not to mention the flagship Longchamp store. Marco was super accommodating. He let my friend in because she arrived by train to the city before my flight landed and he let her in early. She was greeted with wine in the apartment for us as well. When we got a little hot Marco FaceTimed me to make sure the air was on. Check-out was also super easy. This is the perfect place for one or two people who want to stay in the best part of Paris.

Michel went out of his way to make sure we had a wonderful time holidaying in Paris  and we definitely did. 
The place has everything for a comfortable living  from cutlery to saucepans and even an Nespresso machine. 
We would rent  this place again  if we go to Paris in the future. 
Thanks Michel. "
2506462,159031320,2017-06-09,10832386,Salem,Phil is a great host with a good sense of humor. He is certainly a seasoned airbnb host and we could tell by the way he showed us around soon after our arrive and had the keys ready to go. He is an effective communicator and is happy to answer any questions or concerns. I was sick the day I arrived and he even gave me some medicine and asked how I was feeling the next day <3. He is worldly and his apartment is filled with eclectic furniture and decor. His apartment was safe clean metro accessible and his other Airbnb guests were really cool and fun to hang out with. I would not hesitate to stay there again. Thanks Phil!

There were multiple supermarkets boulangeries bars and public transport stations nearby. The beautiful Belleville park was right around the corner. The apartment was very clean all necessities were provided for us and the bed was very comfy! The interior was very pretty and cozy. (It even looked better than the pictures) We instantly felt at home! The check-in and check out was quick and easy. I would definitely stay at his place again.

17861611,200410946,2017-10-05,64344069,Jess,Great little flat in a brilliant spot. Lots of good bars and places to eat nearby. We got a lot of use from the local bakeries and falafel spots right in la marais and close to the Latin quarter. Comfy flat with everything you need.

11152609,487742295,2019-07-14,111465369,Joe,I had a couple of days layover in Paris and stayed at Michel’s place. This apartment well-outfitted and fully delivered on my expectations. And the location cannot be beat with a view of Notre Dame right out the window and so much within a short walk including restaurants shopping and RER/subway. Easy transit to/from CDG airport via RER B also.
13054899,161477450,2017-06-18,122588060,J,"This place is exactly what you see on the picture it's an amazing studio In a great location 3 blocks from a metro station and very comfortable.
Since it is on a live neighborhood you will have some night life notice at nighto but it's part of the adventure. The host will do her best for you being comfortable and fine. "
3124680,451827922,2019-05-12,92925486,Nicole,We had an amazing stay at Benoits apartment its perfect for a stay in Paris and the pictures don’t do it justice. There are large windows which make the space feel very bright and open during the day and the bed is big enough for two! Benoit was an outstanding host our train arrived very late and was delayed on top of that and he waited up for us to take us through the apartment. The apartment is in a very good location and we could walk almost anywhere if we couldn’t then there are multiple metro stations nearby. This is a fantastic place do not hesitate to stay here!
7220349,191982703,2017-09-09,25960101,Tim,We loved staying here. Very close to everything we wanted to see. Great neighborhood lots to do and see. Nearby shops and restaurants were all perfect.  When we come back to Paris next year we will book again.
32489176,437744324,2019-04-15,34842086,Aurelia,"Cosy trendy and huge appartment located in the heart of paris. Enough space for a weekendtrip with 2-3  
Persons.
Disappointing was that it was smoky  although we booked a non-smooking flat the cleaning was not done when we arrived and the check in was not a warm welcome. Unfortunately the heating was not working in the bedroom.
Anyway we would recommend to stay there and enjoy paris."

13879875,325200592,2018-09-19,203589445,Lina,To me location was the studio's best asset. It is near the vibrant Rue Passy cafes and restaurants and a 15 minute walk from Tour Eiffel. The studio is good value for money for a solo traveler on the move. Space is efficient and well-organized given its size. Hana is very warm hospitable and her responses were quick.
11201127,304195750,2018-08-09,179601644,Aysha,"We were very disappointed with the apartment when we arrived as it was a lot smaller then the photos suggest. The apartment is no more than a 1 bedroom flat/large studio. As advertised technically it does sleep 8 but any more than 4 would feel uncomfortable to most. The bed that is on the mezzanine level is advertised as a bedroom. I wouldn't class any area where you can't stand up a bedroom. There is a lack of privacy throughout as the layout is quite open plan and you can hear everything in the bathroom!

There are a lack of basics amenities but surprisingly a total of 4 flat screen TVs. I would have appreciated some shower gel tea/coffee bottled water. We even had to call the host (a management company) for toilet roll as there was none on arrival. This issue was resolved swiftly. 

There was a bad raw sewage smell coming from the toilet which we reported. A response was received promptly. I don't know if the problem was resolved as we only stayed for 1 night. 

Pros are the apartment is clean modern and in an excellent location. 

My conclusion is that as there were only 3 of us staying in the flat it wasn't good value for money. We paid a total of £336 for the night."
17861127,150983752,2017-05-10,49427449,Dani,A localização é ótima. O bairro Marais é adorável. Restaurantes cafés bem próximo. Próximo a metros e deslocamento foi super fácil. O apartamento é lindo super novinho e tem de tudo. To de cama é ótima banheiro é amplo.
2760625,66367713,2016-03-22,43520601,Nicola,"We had a generally excellent experience with this apartment and the company A La Parisienne. Ariadne was our host and she was very informative. She told us everything we needed for the apartment and we had her number for any problems. We were also allowed to check in at 11am which was helpful for us as our flight arrived into CDG airport at 7am. 

The apartment itself was as described in the advert. It was well decorated and thought out. There were two bathrooms which was a bonus and the main bathroom itself was large with an excellent shower. The bedroom was a good size and had plenty of storage space for clothes. We really enjoyed the kitchen and living room and there was a lovely view of the Eiffel Tower. It was on a private street so it was quiet. There was also a lift but we didn't use it as it was on the first floor. We felt secure in the apartment as there were plenty locks and doors with security features. The kitchen was very well stocked and we used in many times. You could easily cook complicated meals in there if you wanted. It was very helpful to have a washer-dryer as we could clean our clothes before we left. The location of the apartment is perfect for tourists. We have visited Paris many times and always prefer staying in the 7eme. It is close to main attractions as well as Rue Cler and Saint-Dominique which have plenty of eating and shopping options. There is an RER station very close (Pont de l'Alma) which will take you either to CDG airport or directly to Versailles (we recommend going.) Over the bridge you will find the Alma-Marceau station which is good for using the metro. Our journey in a taxi (using G7 app) from CDG only took about 45 minutes each time. 

We did have a small problem with being locked out of the main street which locked the gates at night. We didn't have the code but it turns out neither did anyone. The team managed to fix this for us and for them it was unforeseen as they hadn't been told the gate was being locked. Better communication from the building management would have avoided this but as I said not the team's fault. 

Overall we had a great stay in this apartment and as we enjoy visiting Paris regularly we will be back. If you have kids I would recommend this apartment as there is plenty space for a cot (I think I saw one in the wardrobe) or for one child to sleep in the living room. Plus the kitchen is large enough. "
3367326,30901105,2015-04-28,31318499,Marijana,Unser Aufenthalt in Maries Appartement war super. Alles war genau so wie auf den Bildern. Alles war sauber und für uns vorbereitet. Jedes Mal wenn wir aus dem Fenster schauten waren wir von Sicht auf den Eifelturm überwältigt. Wir würden sofort wieder hinfahren. Das Appartement können wir nur weiterempfehlen. Vielen Dank.
13430204,80944842,2016-06-20,75630598,Sophie,Adélie is a great host! She made a list with good bars/restaurants and cafés for us and also made us feel very welcome. The apartment is small but very comfortable. It has everything you need! The most amazing about this apartment is the location. Les Marais is a great neighbourhood! Very central. In short we had a great time in Paris thanks to Adélie and her great apartment!

13498670,92526915,2016-08-09,5391262,Olena,We spent a week in Alexia's flat and we like our visit. This place is comfortable because it is central and cosy. If you are going to wander in the centre of Paris you can reach a lot of famous places like Louvre Notre Dame etc. Alexia is very hospitable and diligent hostess.
24319496,305532328,2018-08-11,95961527,Kiril,Great place for the location. 
18382229,211077254,2017-11-12,55088765,Marja,A really cute studio that serves its purpose in the heart of Paris. Excellent for two people or a solo traveler. Guillaume was very friendly and helpful 
3215428,16043573,2014-07-20,18091121,Moshe,"Etienne and Sylvie are the nicest couple in Paris! 
Straight when we got to the apt they were very kind and helped us with directions to the beautiful sightseeing places the apt was extremly clean and very beautiful and the neighbourhood was safe with a great location. We highly recommend you to stay there.."

This neighborhood is comparatively quite place even though sometimes you’ll hear some conflicts or music from outside it was mostly fine when it was at night. You can enjoy free coffee every morning here and the bathroom is sparkling clean. Anyway because of this lovely place me and my partner both enjoyed this city again a lot. Thank you Robert!
12025717,110498178,2016-10-26,32956990,Youjin,Vlad & Ira's place was clean and cozy my parents stayed here for 2 weeks and they enjoyed their stay. The living room sofa beds were surprisingly comfortable. Fully quipped kitchen safe community and parking space!! Wish the bathroom was accessible from the living room but we knew this before. Excellent value for the money & superb communication with the owners. I'd have them stay here again in the future.

On se sent tres vite faire partie d'une famille qui vient du monde entier !
Deux maitres mots : echange et partage.
A signaler salle d'escalade et muscu gigantesque à 5mn.
Avant de partir ne pas oublier de faire le petit selfie avec le polaroid prévu pour ca et de l'accrocher sur le mur de portraits !
Sûr je reviens là lors de mon prochain sejour à SF !

16569308,214886906,2017-11-26,146697383,Herve,The most important thing is that we had a great time staying at Amber's place. It's central location made it a breeze to get anywhere in SF.  The slightly unusual layout made it that much more fun to stay there.  The kitchen is on the small side but worked for us.  Great beds had us sleeping in a heartbeat.
1356129,498394519,2019-07-29,128027557,Jeremy,Loved the space and location. Great hosts and we were able to come and go as we pleased without disturbing them. Would absolutely stay there again on our next vacation!
738547,350240360,2018-11-18,194411737,Sherry,Lots of stairs but hey that’s San Francisco!
785901,401145135,2019-01-13,233710971,Kelli,Great place! Fun people! The location was right next to Chinatown. Be warned the hostel is up a few flights of stairs
14852542,130589249,2017-02-06,95471354,David,We stayed 3 nights with 4 adults.  This place was perfect!  Even better than the pictures.  Megan also responded to all communications immediately.  We definitely recommend this place!

1104362,67184760,2016-03-27,8155439,Jade,I booked with Jan on behalf of a colleague of mine who was relocating to the San Francisco area. Jan was very quick to respond shared all necessary details of the check in and stay and made sure that our guest was welcomed and well accommodated. Great host great place!
720811,90622163,2016-08-01,21459074,Goncalo,"Our stay at Ron and Cherie ' s apartment was good. We met Ron and he was nice and gave us some suggestions for a nice breakfast around the neighbourhood. Checkin and checkout went very well and Ron was really flexible. 
Regarding the apartment  it has all you need for a small family. Pros: Super comfy bed nice garden especially for family with kids and in a calm neighbourhood.  Cons: a microwave would be so handy ;)

Recommend the apartment and the hosts!"
1931788,249204621,2018-04-01,35995830,José,La casa de Jim es preciosa la ubicación es buena en un barrio muy residencial con buenos lugares de comida con fáciles accesos en transporte público. Jim es un tipo extremadamente amable nos aconsejó en todo momento nos hizo sentir en cada. Recomiendo ampliamente este alojamiento.
2123469,302623771,2018-08-05,140692200,驰,a great experience!
2783251,528757460,2019-09-13,259841310,Megan,We had a fantastic stay at Ellen's apartment. She gave us tips of where restaurants were and things to do and see around the area. Great location and would recommend to anyone staying in San Fran.
6006768,452692455,2019-05-13,52261151,Andrew,Mimi and Mosh were phenomenal hosts. The unit was lovely and their neighborhood and location were perfect for walking to all of the best parts of the city. Highly recommend and hope to stay again!
32389762,483705419,2019-07-07,268421642,Tim,"This is a great B&B! Well located nice apartment and good decorated. Good bed for a perfect sleep and rest. Nice kitchen with great fridge and coffee machine. Nice coffee too. As well as perfect bathroom. Fast response and action from hosts K&J. Improvement tips;    Vacuum clean floors a bit more while was not totally clean and invest in the garden to make the view and terrace nice so guest could enjoy breakfast outside there. Overall good B&B and I recommend it.

585225,519527808,2019-08-28,58474343,Liesbeth,Loved the place quiet neighborhood. Good local tips busstop around the corner.  And nice bakery’s whoole food on 24th street.
19265072,179128570,2017-08-06,44379164,Jared,Won's place was great! He was very nice and easy to communicate with and his place looks great and was very central. Would definitely recommend!
20994570,526950341,2019-09-09,146636133,Sarah,"Kal's place is in a great location - just a stone's throw away from Golden Gate Park and Ocean Beach. The neighbourhood felt safe to walk around and there was plenty to do in the immediate area. 

The accommodation was sparkling clean with thoughtful amenities such as coffee and shampoo and Kal was great at replying when we had any questions. 

All in all it was a cozy spot to come home to after a busy day exploring San Francisco and I can't recommend it enough!"
859310,3235547,2013-01-02,4517621,Daniel,Wonderful experience - great location in the Mission District that makes for a perfect spot to venture out from. Close to great food shopping and transit options (BART Muni) to get anywhere else in SF. Excellent hosts amazing view of the city from the bedroom. Can't say enough good things about this place!
379349,72635310,2016-05-04,67065583,Jessica,This is a great location for me since it's a 10 minute walk from my son's place.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood feels very safe.  When people are moving about the room above it can be a little noisy but Miriam was very considerate to warn me that they would be entertaining one evening.  She also welcomed me with delicious blonde brownies.  We met briefly and had a nice chat.  I would stay here again.
4069838,358837227,2018-12-15,58517805,Marwa,Ashley's place is beautiful and filled with absolutely everything you might need. It's in a great location with vibrant murals great restaurants and easy access to downtown. One of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed at!
680288,64198211,2016-03-01,44627982,Donna,Dont hesitate to book here.  The cottage was delightful.  Perfect stay.  Awesome location and terrific hosts!  I would absolutely go & stay there again.  It couldn't have been better!
585326,406488952,2019-01-29,105644818,Luye,This is nice place to stay. And the pubic transportation is very convenient here
18286171,286676287,2018-07-06,200052018,Elizabeth,Quite and quick to respond very pleasant to stay with
1998111,127050758,2017-01-15,96882255,Amanda,Kenix is a lovely hostess! She was amazing at communication and always available and ready to help with whatever we needed! She had some great tips for seeing the city and her home was very clean neat and the space was wonderful! Parking could be tricky so Kenix went the extra mile to ensure we had a great parking spot for the night! A great stay!
8904047,122947931,2016-12-26,56705404,Theresa,We were very happy with Amy's space.  We plan on staying there again on our next trip to San Francisco.  It was clean modern and well-decorated.  It is a good size for a couple.  The check-in process was very quick and efficient.  We liked that it was located in a neighborhood but within a short walking distance to Velencia Street where there were many shops restaurants and bar/clubs.
22568473,555600054,2019-10-27,11136517,Emily,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9752553,206966805,2017-10-27,1599617,Matthew,We had a fantastic week at Paul's - great introduction and orientation from the host and a picture perfect location amongst the shops and restaurants in Pacific Heights. The apartment is spacious and great for 2-4 people. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare and enjoy your own meals the closet is large the keyhole view of the Golden Gate is spectacular as you walk out the front door. We would definitely return perhaps next time with our daughters
14179987,121910651,2016-12-19,104507479,John,Very quaint and quite. It's absolutely adorable and very romantic for couples. Lots of shops restaurants and bars just one block over on chestnut. I highly recommend this anyone.
13635551,90682214,2016-08-01,84618914,Sachiko,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I am definitely glad Leena was my first host! Quick response smooth communication and the place was fantastic! Very clean and cozy and simply just a place you'd want to come home to after a long day of being out. 

I was there for 2 nights with 2 of my girlfriends...they took turns sleeping on the couch but said that it was comfortable! The bathroom was clean and was provided with amenities and more than enough towels. Very accessible to get around and great neighborhood. 

If I had to say one thing...the only inconvenience I had was parking. Since only street parking was available. But that's about it. And be careful with the parking restrictions of when you can park. I totally missed the sign and got a ticket! But even with this I would still love to come back! I highly recommend this place!"
14804950,151394468,2017-05-12,13087721,Anna,It was fantastic! Great location minutes from Mission district close to the BART. The bed is super comfortable! Great shower and everything you need for a short term stay. Would highly recommend for anyone!
1992217,75280799,2016-05-20,5510892,Noemi,"We really enjoyed our stay with Peter who is extremely warm welcoming and generous with information. The room is very nice and comfortable with great views. The location is fantastic between Noe Valley the Castro district and the Mission our favourite part of town. 
Our experience was perfect and we highly recommend to visitors to stay at Peter's place.
Thanks Peter for your amazing hospitality and your delicious breakfasts! Joe and Noemi

13618517,491157220,2019-07-19,209882742,Jessica,"Amazing little spot near Union Square. Lots of places close by to eat must eat brunch and dinner spot is Lapisara Eatery a block or so away. Mexican at Matador is amazing too! Finally Sushi at Sanraku is another MUST I found quite handy when we’d been out all day was nice to eat close by. 
Fantastic coffee complimentary in the lobby of a morning along with cold drinks of an afternoon. 
My only downfall was at check in; due to it being a Timeshare type complex there was a haggle of trying to get you to tie into their other resorts etc. Some people may not mind this; I just found it a bit pressing of hard sales after we’d been travelling for a long time. But after we’d expressed no interest there was no further chasing of it.
Thanks for a fantastic stay and memorable stay in San Fran!"
10088395,64627133,2016-03-06,45220270,Kunal,I had a wonderful time staying with Stephen. He was a friendly thoughtful host who made sure I was enjoying my stay and the neighborhood. The bedroom was comfortable and I appreciated the closet space and drawer shelves to store my things. The bathroom was large and clean with great water pressure and temperature. Stephen encouraged me to treat his home like my own graciously offering me the use of his office area to get work done and his sound system to kick back and relax. I would definitely stay with Stephen again should the need arise I wish my visit had been longer!
3759246,49193164,2015-10-01,1772270,Kellie,I booked this in-law for myself and my boyfriend for just one night and on very short notice but David was quick to reply and very accommodating with our late check-in.  It was a good space for our quick trip but would be great for a longer stay as well.  And we could use the driveway space!  The only drawback was the construction right next door but it got us out of bed right when we needed to be.
6423158,277571191,2018-06-16,165028479,Elizabeth,Alice’s place was perfect for a week long visit.  She provided all the extras we could need including information about the public transportation system.  The neighborhood is beautiful and there was always a place out front to park.  
9197404,71412397,2016-04-25,397512,Vicki,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Shawna's classic SF Victorian. The room had everything I needed-- plenty of clothing storage reading light fresh air and the best part - a host kitty named Whiskey who purred when she saw me. She even kept me company at night.

The bathroom is spacious and a drawer is designated for the guest's use. The water pressure was great. 

There was a sweet little patio off of the kitchen where I enjoyed my morning tea. 

The neighborhood is fantastic for walking movie theaters public transportation for restaurants and unusual shopping including boutiques vintage furniture and art galleries. I highly recommend Creativity Explored on 16th and Guerrero. The varied cuisine offerings are Indian street food vegan  Mexican Tapas Mediterranean and fabulous bakeries to name a few.

But the best part of my stay was getting to know my host. While we didn't spend a lot of time together the time we did spend was both interesting and very congenial. I feel like I made a new friend in my home town.

Highly recommend this listing and I will definitely return. "
28182805,400027038,2019-01-10,224691288,Tatiana,great space in an ideal location.  note that although the apt can accommodate 2 (1 in the bedroom the other in a pull out couch) the space is quite small and not ideal for any groups that are not family/ closely related.  would absolutely stay here again.
13685131,490539964,2019-07-18,30842724,Dolores,This is a comfortable and cozy studio located in a quiet residential area near downtown SF. It is ideal for couples and solo travellers. Marty is a kind and helpful host. We thoroughly recommend staying at his place and when we come back to San Francisco we’ll surely be staying with him again! Thank you Marty!
859336,86419309,2016-07-16,77432431,Russell,Anka (and Milo the dog) are lovely and friendly. The room is everything as described and the location in Castro is perfect for an easy trip downtown on the trolley buses or an interesting area to explore in its own right. Top tip - use the recommendations for eat and drink in the info folder
992676,16139714,2014-07-22,15357755,Tim,Do you want a place with all the comforts of a good hotel room?  Convenient transport to both San Francisco Airport and the City? A host who likes to greet and get to know her guests but also gives them privacy? You won't be disappointed with this Studio Oasis and Kate's hospitality.  Five stars!
4387067,216628916,2017-12-04,151298630,Melissa,A beautiful room in a great neighborhood. What more could you want? The listing was very accurate and the room is so spacious I had plenty of room for my morning yoga practice. I whole heartedly recommend!
27765343,429705564,2019-03-28,243181136,Konrad,Emily's apartment was fantastic! It was well located in SoMa and very tastefully decorated.  The bed was comfy and it was nice having a personal bathroom. Would stay again!
16255081,359738960,2018-12-17,138880928,Eric,Great location!
23611950,480005141,2019-07-01,49553279,Gladys,"Really good location in downtown San Francisco. The room was small but this is no surprise since it was quite cheap for San Francisco... It was clean and the staff was really nice.
I booked a shuttle (from another company) for the airport at the front desk the hotel staff was helpful but the shuttle driver did not come into the lobby to get me and left without me... Had to wait 45minutes to get another one! Be careful and look for the shuttle if you book one."
14220594,431353334,2019-03-31,181102912,Nico,Great place inside. Good escape form the city.
8352275,255206044,2018-04-19,119990392,Ana,We stayed here 3 nights and loved it! We were hesitant at first because it was our first time staying in a shared space but we were pleasantly surprised with how much privacy we had. The room is down stairs with its own bathroom like your own little suite. The room had everything we needed like towels toiletries kurig tv/Netflix tons of outlets microwave/mini fridge. The bed was super comfy and the hot tub outside was a huge plus. Brent and his wife Pascale were so pleasant we absolutely recommend staying with them!
24309390,318543928,2018-09-03,155829751,Jeff,Glen graciously opened up his apartment to myself and friends. He was a quick communicator and kept the place very clean! He even left a few extra touches such as water chocolates etc. Anytime I had a question or inquiry Glen met these requests. I would recommend this place and it's location (in a quiet neighborhood).
6653474,39047448,2015-07-20,36167115,Boris,The location is perfect there are buses to take you anywhere in San Francisco. The house was very clean and well managed and Ari was a great host with tons of info about activities and the local cuisine. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good San Fran experience while staying in the heart of this city. Thank you Ari for the experiencewe will be sure to come back.
12679234,188814274,2017-08-30,140453647,Anissa,Very clean house in a quiet houd. We enjoyed our stay in Rachel's home. Rachel was very attentionate and quick to answers to any inquiries. Thanks you Rachel
7067087,419771346,2019-03-04,228263985,Guang,Great place great people
280673,36647666,2015-06-30,23897064,Geneviève,"Shani gave me a warm welcome (and even warmer good bye! because we knew better each others). When I arrived she answered my questions and explained me how to buy a Clipper Card and the bus stops near the house in Church St.  I had ( and have yet) difficulty speaking fluently and understanding ( when people speak fast) english and she tried her best to explain me what she told me. Shani is a VERY GENEROUS woman. I staid at her home 1 month and she gave me many things. 
Her cat is SO SWEET !!!
The room is spacious bright. I can open the window and see flowers and nature. The bed is very good. I did'nt have backache. I can use the fridge. It's very generous.
  And ... it's very very cheap! It's S.F !!! 
 Mission St. and Church St. are near with restaurants and there's a lot of launderettes all around. I can wash and dry my clothes quickly. There's a lot of markets too.
Shani's house is a VERY good renting in S.F. She's a good hostess even she has a lot of work."
5905530,458192579,2019-05-25,257390498,Shalini,Great place wonderful host.
17585947,532435385,2019-09-19,36574146,Sarah,Perfect sized lovely guest apartment for a couple visiting the city. Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood easy to access the marina beaches bridge etc. via Uber or Lyft.
12026856,93225850,2016-08-12,78695788,Chelsea,Cute place in a very sweet neighborhood and Maria was helpful and accessible. I'd highly recommend staying here if you're in San Francisco. 
5853587,404095848,2019-01-22,198196695,Erick,Rick's place is in a very nice spot with easy access to public transit and local spots. I very much enjoyed my time.
4110344,429377185,2019-03-27,38793910,Leonard,Great location very easy and efficient check in. Isn’t over the top but it is a affordable safe and convenient location with great customer service.
719431,26866954,2015-02-21,2104098,Shiloh,This apartment was a great spot to relax during our travels in San Francisco! We stayed in the Garden Suite which had 3 nice-size windows two of which look directly out on to the beautiful garden. The apartment is on the 1st floor and we loved the keyless entry. The  fridge and convection/microwave oven in the suite made it easy to prepare meals and we had access to a full shared kitchen if needed. Having access to a washer and dryer on the 1st floor was great as well. Others have mentioned that sound travels in this house and that's true -- it's nothing extreme but if you are sensitive to sound it might be a consideration as you can occasionally hear footsteps and voices from other units. The neighborhood is beautiful -- the house is on a residential street with many restaurants and shopping options just 2 blocks down the hill. It is very convenient to public transportation which made it easy to get anywhere from the beach to the Castro quickly. Phil was a wonderful host - I definitely recommend this apartment! 
1926253,197994809,2017-09-27,99466946,Dave,"Lovely little spot with nice little touches such as some supplies in the fridge maps and a couple of BART tickets to get you started.

Alittle bit noisy with the dogs scuttling about upstairs but fine overall. 

Neighbourhood is quiet."
21113266,332205028,2018-10-04,128905401,Matthew,I highly recommend staying here!! We arrived to candle light and a bottle of wine!! We flew in on a late flight and the back yard hot tub felt sooooo good!  we had everything we needed and more! Any questions throughout our stay were answered quickly! I would definitely stay here again;)!
10321776,368984075,2019-01-08,6819511,Jose,Arpita's place was perfect for what we needed.  She was super nice and always available with any question we had.  The place was sparkling clean and more spacious than we expected.  The place is a bit far from the city center but it is perfect for those who have a car and want piece of mind that the parking is free and it is safe outside and those who want to sleep in a quiet street away from the noise of the city.  Also the metro stop to the city center is only two blocks away so it is pretty easy to get around.
10603148,203246112,2017-10-14,2530567,Krister,John’s place was beautiful and incredibly conveniently located in Nob Hill. Better than all of this was the warm and gracious hospitality he offered from when we arrived to when we left. I left his home wanting to be as welcoming and kind as he is on a daily basis. I cannot imagine finding a better location and host in the city.
51773,252594,2011-05-05,530251,Jeff,Jay continues to be awesome -- I would stay with her on every visit to SF!
4902565,33338194,2015-05-26,33670661,Jianjun,Host is very nice to leave to key to us. The room is as described. 
4257302,152636512,2017-05-17,41091842,Emily,Overall this place is a good value for what it offers and its location. The bed and linens were lovely. As a former resident of the neighborhood I was a bit disappointed by how far away it was from Divisadero (about a 10 minute walk). Because of the (very reasonable) privacy measures it was hard to know this would be the case so it's certainly not the host's fault. I found the ambient noise (e.g. barking dog and other loud noises right above the bedroom ~8am) to be irritating since I was on vacation and trying to sleep in. I doubt I'd stay here again since there is a perfectly nie and affordable hotel nearby on Divis that costs about the same but I appreciated Alexandra's hospitality. 
958507,13241205,2014-05-23,13347726,Brian,"Absolutely the best way to visit San Francisco.  We had a great time at John's house.    It's in a great location everything was an easy walk or quick cab ride.  The house had plenty of space comfortable beds and allowed us enough room to spread out at the end of the day.  Everything we needed was provided communication with John was great and we'll certainly look to stay here again if we are back in San Francisco.  

I spend 150+ nights in hotels each year and let me assure you this was a very welcome change.  The costs were actually cheaper than a hotel so if you are considering hotel vs John's house hands down stay with John.  I would not hesitate to bring my family or friends if I had the occasion to do so.   

Thank you John for the great stay and wonderful property!"

We had the whole bottom floor to ourselves . The veiw was amazing . After going out it was so relaxing to come back to a nice glass of wine and watch the sunset from the grand windows . 
Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a nice quiet place to stay in a high end neighborhood . With a wonderful host that makes you feel like it's your home too. 

Thank you Dee and hope to visit again in the future .

4718531,110990626,2016-10-29,87646336,Eric,Mike was an amazing host! He warmly greeted me when I arrived showed me around and then got out of the way. He always responded very quickly to my messages and event let me borrow some of his props for a costumed event I had to attend. Would certainly recommend!
2111361,23351358,2014-11-29,23700415,Rian,Carlos was a really caring person. And it was a great experience staying at his place. The place was the same as pictures and the apt was secured and clean! Everything was perfect and absolutely better than inn or just hotel. I wished this place would be mine:). wanted to stay longer in here!!! Thanks for this opportunity Carlos!
19014320,267456417,2018-05-21,119962706,Brittany,Perfect place to stay and explore the city! My husband and I managed to make it work even though it was a little snug but the location and walkability of the place more than makes up for it. You’re not supposed to spend all your time indoors in such a great city...go out and explore while making this cottage yours to rest up in for the next day of adventure.
21459964,456108755,2019-05-20,77787499,Hank,Clean convenient place to pier 39 loving the decoration of the house and the great host. All these stuffs make this feel like home.
15400940,137839245,2017-03-17,97158785,David,Great clean apartment in an exceptional location.  Wonderful restaurants shops & markets within blocks.  Especially loved the small park across the street.
44032,662166,2011-10-25,973953,Cesar,"Comfortable and beautiful place the location is very convenient; bear in mind it is a busy neighborhood rich and diverse.
Great location for BART and restaurants...Check out 16th Street"
14475808,106354126,2016-10-05,9886846,Noam,"Ernest is a nice guy but we were very disappointed with the apartment. In short the communication with Ernest was poor he didn't answer our calls when we arrived and he wasn't at the apartment to welcome us. We were lucky that his father was next door and he succeeded to contact Ernest. Even when we left the house and sent him a message he didn't answer. The location of the house is not attractive (and that is an understatement) far from the center of city. The apartment is literally empty.

220418,198504687,2017-09-29,122245210,Mélanie,Chambre très sympathique bien située car proche des transports en commun et restaurants. Salle de bain partagée pour 3 chambres et chambre spacieuse.  Cependant nous n’avons jamais rencontré notre hôte...
21584555,471015527,2019-06-16,109849888,Corey,My friend and I had a lovely time at their home. Everything was clean and the home is beautiful. Felt like being at home with all the lovely touches. The room with the en suite bathroom made all the difference and was so perfect. Hope to visit and stay here again soon!
5070945,74081925,2016-05-13,22531846,Luke,This is basically a hotel with a kindof hostel vibe. We got the room with a private bathroom and it was quite nice. Checkin was easy with the front desk clerk I felt safe and comfortable the entire time :)
2770268,349535583,2018-11-17,184982392,Joshua,Convenient location good experience.  Thanks!
3257886,520034012,2019-08-29,233362688,Claire,Great place to stay with cute outdoor area. Easy to get to central SF and all others places of interest.
3697738,81414321,2016-06-22,19345601,George,Jay and Tina were wonderful hosts. Their home is in a great neighborhood close to shops and restaurants. The home is impeccably clean and is stocked with all the essentials you'd need. We would look forward to coming home after a day of sight seeing to the home relax in the living room followed by wine in the garden. Thanks jay and Tina!
24129914,456864955,2019-05-22,230330157,Kayla,We had a great stay in Leslie's space. It's very cute and comfortable and we were able to take advantage of the full kitchen and washer/dryer which was very convenient. Be prepared for a large spiral staircase up to the bedroom/bathroom. It was a short walk to restaurants and Lafayette park. The only issue we ran into was finding street parking and having to move our car for street cleaning but other than that we had a great stay.
27699796,459730953,2019-05-27,124777110,Cherry,The owner is really helpful.
752607,60499045,2016-01-24,53651143,Dan,This place was everything we wanted and Lily was a great host. She was out of town but easily reachable by text. I'd definitely recommend staying here. 
7930461,77948118,2016-06-04,58399140,Quinton,"This was our very first Air BnB experience and we could not have chosen a better apartment in a better location. After a long flight from Australia to San Francisco we were beyond relieved when we hopped off of the MUNI and walked only a few minutes up the street to Justine and Matt's little oasis. The studio was lovely and private absolutely spotless beautiful and warm with gorgeous sheets towels and a HUGE flat screen TV that is great to switch on and zone out to after a big day sightseeing. The area of West Portal was absolutely gorgeous too we loved it. I would wake up early and wander down to Peets coffee to send off some emails over an espresso and we usually finished off with dinner at Squat and Gobble which has really great food for a great price! 
Initially we decided to stay out of the city to save a little bit of money but I can safely say that if we return (Which we may do on this trip) we will stay again at Justine's apartment in the beautiful West Portal. Don't think about it just do it. "
11464408,70782666,2016-04-20,47901143,Emma,We was made to feel very welcome. The room is very private and you have everything you need. Ulysses is lovely and even helped us out with a little car problem. Would definitely stay again 
14142409,94723865,2016-08-16,85671220,Katrina,This apartment was great and we felt very comfortable in it. We were first timers in San Fran and we are very happy to have found this place. BUT for future guests who are driving like we did their is NO parking on premises it is only street parking but since the home is on a main street parking can be difficult and may need to park a few blocks away. Otherwise the apartment was very clean and had everything we needed and was a good location for walking to Golden Gate park and to restaurants near by! Would stay here again!
4558898,455523099,2019-05-19,33602537,Jaime,Stylish and beautiful apartment room was very comfortable. Perfect location
19015884,282239996,2018-06-26,25709548,Michael,Jennifer’s apartment is fantastic - full of thoughtful touches to make life easier. Small things like ice in the freezer plenty of coffee and hand soap in the bathroom all make life that bit easier! Jennifer gave us lots of great tips for SF and really made us feel welcome.
30817227,426353376,2019-03-20,2760294,Michael,Thanks! Staying at Pankaj and Sarah's apartment was easy and uneventful. I was here for work and it was super easy to check-in/check-out with the very complete instructions and the apartment was wonderfully decorated.
4902855,62084943,2016-02-11,48088011,David,The response time was very fast when any correspondence happened (digitally).  The Tenderloin district was a bit more of a high-risk neighborhood than I had thought but Tony's building was secure and had cameras as well.
9650878,202075536,2017-10-09,13049148,Thao,I had a wonderful stay at Carl and Michael's airbnb and would definitely recommend it. They are responsive thoughtful and helpful hosts. The location is in a quaint area; it's a  lovely neighbourhood to stroll around to see Victorian style houses (it is quite close to the Painted ladies). The room I stayed in is clean and spacious with a fridge and connected to a clean shared washroom. Overall a great value stay.
1855096,237633618,2018-02-23,20050640,Richard,"Super adresse.
Quartier très sympa. Très beaux espaces dans l'appartement. Chambre avec lit très confortable salle de bain très agréable grande cuisine et super espaces de vie commune.
Tout est parfait !"
909063,146360516,2017-04-22,18714029,Prathamesh D,"With the underground rail and other commute options just round the corner the place was very connected with wherever you wanted to get to. In fact the subway to and from the airport passes thru the corner station. And being a teeny block away the place gets no vibrations due to the passing trains.

The only thing is the accommodation is on Level 3 (which actually means second floor as in the US the ground floor is Level 1). But that was not much of an issue as Mark helped me up with my luggage effortlessly!

Mark & Rafael are well-stocked with all the regular things one would expect to get one self through the day. They even had adapter plugs of all varieties. Mind well should you request one in a hotel chances are you may have to wait a day till your turn comes to be allotted one. And some hotels just point you in the direction of a nearby convenience store to get one.
If you have time to waste there is a huge TV. And if you have time for relaxing you can sit under the open sky perched up the tall the chairs and table with a mug in hand!

They have a very lovable dog. First dog I have ever come across in my life who did not bark even once during my entire stay - he just looks at you calmly sometimes with a slight tilt of the head.

The neighbours (the ones I met) too were very friendly and supportive.

Mark was very welcoming a perfect host. He gave excellent suggestions for the restaurants in the vicinity.
It may be noted that there is just one bathroom but I never had any issue due to that during my entire stay.

Lastly the place is well-stocked with books and magazines has excellent wifi speed is airy with lot of natural light.

What worked for me most was the study table in the room with a comfortable chair. And then I also had the sofa and the rocking chair (both in the room) to relax in!

221342,315046977,2018-08-27,113847595,Conrad,Perfect location to explore San Francisco.  I would recommend it to anyone.
3808193,461524753,2019-05-31,26146126,Christopher,James’s apartment is a very conveniently located little hideaway within easy walking and commuting distance to a lot of areas. He was a great and easy host with quick responses. The apartment is well decorated and very comfortable though there is not a lot of storage space available. It was a very enjoyable stay.
99094,336259741,2018-10-14,203162606,Julie,A great night out highly recommend for solo travelers.
17551632,318506720,2018-09-03,33338887,Charles,Susanna et Jason ont été des hôtes absolument parfaits. Prévenants à l'écoute et extrêmement réactifs. La chambre est mignonne isolée du reste du logement où vous serez totalement autonomes. Il y a plein de petites attentions qui confirme que Susanna et Jason sont des hôtes expérimentés. La localisation est presque parfaite vous êtes à côté de tout grâce aux Uber pour 5 à 10 dollars par trajet maximum. Je recommande cet endroit à 100% et je sais où dormir la prochaine fois que je me rends à San Francisco.
15207940,256832611,2018-04-23,25838588,Becca,The room was very spacious clean and beautiful. Ha was very generous meeting me to check in late. Thank you so much!
22715454,282955151,2018-06-28,60075505,Ana,The house is very clean the beds are confortable and the kitchen well equipped.  It’s a good space for a family of 4.
4833101,331480714,2018-10-02,121880604,Cara Elizabeth,Such an amazing place to stay I had to come back a second time. Couldn't recommend Mike and his wonderful home enough!
8356380,278746395,2018-06-18,29890294,Flavia,"Cheryl is a very good host in case of need she answered immediately she gave important informations and she even lent us her scale to weigh our baggage.
The room is located next to the garage has a small window overlooking the garden. Is cute clean have a nice style big where we could move very well in two people with lot of baggages. There was a coffee machine water tea coffee chocolates salted peanuts.... A bathroom with bathtub where perhaps there was a bit of humidity due to the fact that there was not a window  in the bathroom and maybe the fan was not strong enough. In any case we found ourselves as well as we were at our home the bed is very comfortable. Very good neighborhood we know nothing about public transport because we only moved by car and stay only one night. I absolutely recommend it!"
15662917,262700648,2018-05-09,10304374,Camaren,Eileen's place is the very best!
15051965,229290851,2018-01-22,57513598,W,Would second other comments about cleanliness space linens and communication with host.  Will definitely stay again when visiting my son.
930955,5651662,2013-07-09,5912169,Andy,Luke was great to deal with and his apartment is in a great location and is very well-kept and exceptionally clean. Having a spot to park was also a big plus although it's just a short stroll to the beautiful little village of Cole Valley. Will definitely repeat if available on future trips. 
909063,6889695,2013-08-29,6154429,Siobhan,I had an amazing time in San Francisco with Mark and Rafael. They are delightful hosts and their home is amazing. Mark and Rafael make you feel like a part of the family. San Fran was the final leg of my trip and when I saw my gorgeous room I felt so at home. It was by far my best experience on airbnb and I hope to stay in contact with these guys and visit again with my children next trip. Thanks Mark and Raf for a beautiful and special time x
11100926,419354286,2019-03-03,126427702,Alexandre,Everything went very well the apartment is very comfortable and well equipped!  Yael is very attentive and kind thank you!  We had a great time.
32747602,467709353,2019-06-10,150959245,Rob,This is newly remolded modern space to sleep 6. The location was great and we had a place to park added bonus. Victoria was very accommodating  to our change in schedule. I would stay again.
3225725,410169295,2019-02-09,81355435,Nathalie,"Nica's place was everything we needed to get our start in San Francisco. We needed to be close to the CalTrain and other public transit reliable wifi for work and also wanted to have a space in which we could feel at home - all of which we got in Nica's home! 

Amenities: full kitchen with dining area washer/dryer (!!) huge TV all in good working order. Wifi worked perfectly and reliably the entirety of our stay. 
Bathroom: although the bathroom is shared my husband and I rarely ever had to wait to use it in the 4-5 months we were there. Nica had the bathroom cleaned every week everything was perfectly clean! 
Location: good accessibility to the CalTrain a lot of different Bus stops and a Ford GoBike station nearby. Wholefoods is a very quick bus ride away a corner market is 2 blocks away and a Wallgreens is conveniently located on the corner of Potrero & 24th. 
View: Spectacular view from the bedroom!! 
Host responsiveness: the few times we ever had questions about the unit Nica responded incredibly fast and helped us resolve any issue we had! 

All in all the apartment was very accurately advertised and was exactly what we needed. Thank you again Nica!!"
15643873,226457550,2018-01-10,1614609,Joey,We loved having our team offsite at Michael's place -- would definitely recommend for team sizes up to 10.  It's a great location for both food lunch options and proximity to public transportation for those coming from outside of the city.  We will definitely be back again!
1511076,484902483,2019-07-09,7294980,Jeff,Jefferson and Gary are amazing hosts with a wonderful space. Their home could not be better situated in the city and they've provided a lot of thoughtful touches that make a stay here extra comfortable and memorable. Highly recommend!!
1203526,38802054,2015-07-18,6687758,Nathan,Ashirvadam welcomed us nicely into his home and everything was as described. Really pretty quiet neighborhood too!
19039703,295973152,2018-07-24,11023812,Jane,"Sandy’s place is very close to Golden Gate Park. The furnishings are simple which is all we needed. There is a refrigerator and microwave and a pot to make hot water. 
Though it is very private once you are in the space you do enter through the front door and walk through the garage and back outside to your private door. "
16897598,466845499,2019-06-09,5021129,Glenn,Great place close to transport and shops on quiet street
33578,71464666,2016-04-25,2273556,Yao,I love staying with Kepa in San Francisco her spaces are always a delight! My last stay with her made such an impression on me that I knew I wanted to stay with her again this time. Her amazing botanical garden is such an oasis in the heart of San Francisco. She made me and my husband feel so welcome the whole time I love that she lives on sight and is available for questions or requests. Being a creative myself I really appreciated all of the design decor and architecture in her spaces. Everything you need is readily available in the space and kept so neat and clean. Thanks again Kepa!
33781225,469536737,2019-06-14,22973095,Alison,Location was convenient for us as we had an event to attend nearby. Otherwise would never have paid for this spot. Jessica was informative and the unit was found as advertised.
27938375,332631610,2018-10-05,4201458,Laurin,Valentino is a very friendly and gracious host and a wealth of knowledge for great local eats.  The Dollhouse is quite charming but being an old house it has some quirks and character that might not be for everyone.  I was not able to get WIFI in my room on the top floor and it's important to note that the individual bedroom doors cannot be locked from the outside to secure your belongings.  The shower on the top floor was also extremely small.  I was also checked into the wrong room and then asked to move after one night.  Despite these small issues I very much enjoyed my stay at the Dollhouse and I will be a returning visitor.
32549667,515962410,2019-08-23,54807373,Eileen,VERY carefully read the instructions for how to lock your room when you leave it because if you are locked out you may be stuck for HOURS before a solution is presented.
18596420,186879333,2017-08-25,103597936,Nicolas,Of the few Air BnBs my friends and I have stayed in on our west coast trip Abby's was easily one of the nicest
1696383,21089552,2014-10-11,16921719,Alison,The room was clean comfortable and safe. Great location in upcoming neighborhood.
3311711,108785824,2016-10-17,59522211,Pam,I felt very welcomed and Rye gave me some great hints on places to see around the city. Room was comfy bathroom great and coffee was yummy and ready when I woke up each morning 
13591271,153770470,2017-05-21,39767983,Sonya,The place was clean and simple. The location was great. I loved being so close to the BART station. 
1498953,55141105,2015-11-28,6891451,Andrew,Beautiful home in a great part of San Francisco. We enjoyed staying so close to the beach and Golden Gate Park and we were very comfortable in Anna and Eddie's fabulous home. The kitchen was wonderful as were the views from the upper deck overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It was a 5 star experience.
14775913,508332252,2019-08-12,11452781,Delphine,Accueil très sympathique et disponible. Merci confortable très bien équipée. Terrasse avec vue incroyable sur San Francisco. A recommander pour un séjour en famille

23521739,528816953,2019-09-13,61567162,Miles,Comfortable easy to access free coffee back patio good value.
3354928,103773086,2016-09-24,28134679,Sue,Tan was a good communicator and the instructions were spot on.  But the apartment smelt and we couldn't find out why.  The neighbours living upstairs are noisy and the renovations to the apartment next door meant that it was not a quiet relaxing experience.  Also we arrived after 11pm and yet there was no milk or useable amenities in the house which would have been a nice touch.
15822076,210146226,2017-11-07,35248184,Brittany,Great place in a nice residential neighbourhood. Everything we needed for a short visit to SF!
5852066,523939670,2019-09-04,68768083,Christine,Had a great stay at Paul’s! The place was clean comfortable and stylishly decorated as well as fully furnished with needed amenities. It was also a pleasure to meet Paul who was friendly great to converse with as well as very helpful with any need that pops up.
164207,162884132,2017-06-22,28356260,Jeremy,Nice place with food within walking distance. Comfortable and good value. Phil is a good host. 
1578597,133160726,2017-02-20,29235553,Valerie,This was a great little studio very clean with a bed so comfortable I wanted to take it home. I found everything exactly as presented and would stay here again.
17191322,165078909,2017-06-30,75026094,Alex,The place was great. Right in downtown. A bit small  but due to the location worth the price. Very clean and he was very accommodating with clear instructions. Would stay there again!
72921,1202442,2012-04-30,373791,Byron & Christine,"This apartment is a gem! And Eric is the most considerate host I've encountered! 
The location couldn't be better! It's a few blocks to the Painted Ladies and great boutiques and restaurants/coffee shops of Lower Haight. 

I booked this apartment for 6 people. The pictures don't capture the fact that it's quite spacious enough for 6! Eric purchased a new table that seats 6 perfectly. He also provided us with all of our cooking needs! (enough pans knives mixing bowls etc. to eat like kings) We ate breakfasts and dinners there and couldn't be happier. The kitchen window has a great view of the city. Even though the pictures make the kitchen look small we actually had 3 people in there prepping and cooking comfortably! 
The apartment is sparkling clean feels very safe sunny has Wifi good water pressure and hot showers for everyone 5 minute drive to Whole Foods and even closer to Safeway and lots of corner markets has a huge walkin closet perfect for storage (or possibly an unruly child) ;) and was just perfect for sleeping in cooking brunch and lounging AND exploring San Francisco! We easily found taxis into downtown on Friday and Saturday nights. 

I will definitely stay at this apartment or any of Eric's places again!"
33969322,559234106,2019-11-03,294289861,Catie,Loved everything about our stay. Beautiful historic hotel and wonderful staff.
144978,478279,2011-08-27,736566,Jennifer,Jay was a wonderful host. She was welcoming kind and her home is very comfortable. I would love to stay again!
28259229,531975204,2019-09-18,253460662,Olivier,Great place to stay and awesome location. Don't forget your hearplug if you're sensitive to noise (bass vibration) on thursday friday and saturday. There is the club SF Underground near Thomas house. Me and my wife slept well all the week :) Very good restaurant in the area. See you !
1356817,173138943,2017-07-22,79248411,Matthew,Alex was an excellent host. He had many wonderful suggestions for the area and offered friendly insiders tips of the city. He communicated when necessary and made sure his guests were very comfortable yet he was not the slightest bit intrusive or unnecessarily involved. 
30175141,560714980,2019-11-07,274079364,Rachel,Fantastic location easy to travel to multiple destinations. Our only complaint was that the bathtub had some mold around it but everything else was very nice.
10455995,233691211,2018-02-10,127036888,Amir,Sarah and Mark are great hosts. I stayed at their place over a month. They are great hosts
191632,193495691,2017-09-13,36069802,Cindy,Maria's place is well appointed and comfortable. The bed was fine. I like that there is a private entrance that does not disturb the home or family. It was easy getting around from her location. The parking is not simple but that is not unique to her (Website hidden by Airbnb) is a global condition of San Francisco.  She was very gracious and helped us find a spot parked her car in it and stayed until we drove to it. She also mailed some things we left behind. She was a very accommodating Air B&B hostess!
3082327,68699874,2016-04-06,51810357,Xinxin,Simon's home is perfect. Very clean quite and have everything you needed. And you can get public transportation very easily. meanwhile Simon is very nice he gave me tips for traveling and it's useful. I only stay there for two days really hope I can get another chance to stay there again.

1214080,6305195,2013-08-07,7179512,Debra,If you want a fabulous place to stay in SF you must stay at Dave's place.  I stayed with my kids and nephew and we had an excellent stay.  Dave is such a gracious host and made us feel right at home.  His dog Maddy gave my kids the wonderful experience of having a dog and got them in training for our new puppy.  From the lovely artwork wonderful garden area and hot tub this is the place to stay in SF.  It is close to the BART and centrally located in the city. I plan to make it my place to stay anytime I am in SF and it is available.
16678379,349524232,2018-11-17,37915655,Alexandra,Perfect bedroom with private bathroom. Key code entryway was a big plus. Quick response during booking and showed great hospitality making sure everything was great. I’d definitely stay here again when I’m in town!
918341,311256446,2018-08-20,33477034,Daniel,Always a pleasure to stay at Kepa's! A little slice of heaven in the big city.
8068539,116465739,2016-11-30,41847886,Issei,It was a perfect place to stay. We had a great time living in great Mission District!
20386464,512965533,2019-08-18,24866267,Tim,Loved this place.  Nice spot to visit in San Francisco.  Easy to hit all of the major spots.  Won was really helpful.
9587361,410786832,2019-02-10,46150644,Zoya,"Nathan&Rita were super accommodating very quick to respond very nice and helpful. Five star hosts!
The only negative comment I will leave (just to have a fair review) is that the place was not as baby/child-friendly as I had hoped. There's not a lot of place for a kid to crawl around and there's some artifacts (like a cool historic record player book shelves and a glass table) that need to be kept a way from a child. The rocking horse (which I thought could be a nice asset for a child) is not for use (it's an artifact to be looked at only). If you're traveling without children this is a very cute place. 
The location is stellar though! Great access to parks grocery stores restaurants. Awesome quite neighborhood! Great for families (with older children). Thanks Nathan&Rita!"
6006768,321616679,2018-09-10,9800780,David,This apartment is cosy but has every facility you will need including excellent laundry facilities. It’s set in a lovely upscale residential area close to transport links to the city. Fillmore Street with its great bars and restaurant is about a 20 minute walk or 5 minute bus ride. Mimi and Mosh are delightful friendly and very quick to respond to any queries.
3611131,69330415,2016-04-10,22261747,King,Apartment was clean well-stocked everything worked just as expected and the free Netflix was a great plus.  Phone service is spotty but the wi-fi made it easy to surf the internet and call.  Painless check-in as well.
5007358,41946940,2015-08-10,34399474,Alane,The room was very clean and it appeared just as described online. The host was very accommodating when me and one other person needed to leave our bags in the house hours before our delayed flight. It was a very wonderful stay to say the least.
4464347,47472764,2015-09-19,33249358,Young,There's no lock for locker even need to buy lockset so have to buy from them. The breakfast is not up to standard as other hostels i stayed before in Europe. Luckily the bathroom still OK.
10788469,364458001,2018-12-30,149865572,Coralie,"La maison de james est très accueillante idéalement située et fonctionnelle.
Le point de vue est juste exceptionnel !
Nous avons passé un séjour confortable agréable rendu possible grâce aux attentions de James à notre égard.
Je recommande vivement ce logement."
17419803,483750293,2019-07-07,39938535,Margo,Really enjoyed staying there. Thank you!
23354077,543424520,2019-10-07,82651726,Rainer,Ein liebevoll eingerichtetes Apartment im Herzen von San Francisco das vor allem durch seine Lage Sauberkeit und dem Komfort punktet! Das Mission Viertel sowie das Castro Viertel liegen in unmittelbarer Nähe und sind fußläufig erreichbar. Viele tolle Cafés und Lokalitäten sind in der Nähe. Ich würde jederzeit wiederkommen!
4069838,21522607,2014-10-19,1839219,Derric,Ashley and Adrian were really great however I didn't feel the space offered any privacy. There is no lock for the door from the inside (but the can lock you in from the outside) a few times they just walked right in without knocking or notice. There is another door that has direct access to the space from the upstairs unit but cannot be locked. The laundry for the entire house is in the kitchen of the space without any notice people will enter the space to do laundry (3 times in 7 days!) look for their cat or to light candles while you're sleeping (yes this really happened). On 2 occasions I found my belongings had been moved. If you're looking for a quiet private space to relax in this isn't the place for you. If you don't mind the intrusions this place is great. Great location (I love Pissed Off Petes) Garage parking (a commodity in SF) Fantastic back yard area and comfy beds.
4439461,73828843,2016-05-10,56276600,Aaron,Really nice.   10/10 would stay again.    High quality clean personable professional.   
3157541,257331011,2018-04-25,52174674,Nathan,Mishi was a wonderful host. Not only is her place great she’s an amazing host. She knows San Francisco well and can give recommendations to make your trip even more memorable.
8592609,135668560,2017-03-05,27001081,Morgane,The place was perfect for us spacious with everything we needed to live during a few weeks. We had a very great stay and would recommend the place to anyone who would be looking for a nice and quiet place to stay in Noe Valley! Great views of the city! Thank you Jenny and Norbert!
23106047,259334542,2018-05-01,2208217,"H V ""Jack""","An incredible garden.  Really lovely and with a view!!
The design inside is thoughtful functional and stylish making excellent use of the limited space."
3082327,343778455,2018-11-01,79107055,Thomas,This was my second stay at Simon's home. Everything was great again. I've possible I would stay also for a 3rd time.
593253,137177043,2017-03-13,24592413,Shelby,Trevor and Scott are phenomenal hosts and you can't beat the location of their adorable spacious home. Nestled in Lower Height & surrounded by great food and bars it's also within walking distance of upparks and scenic spots. Trevor and Scott made me feel like a local for a short 48 hours. 
845501,470055376,2019-06-15,244390966,Samantha,Very nice and loved the location would come back again.
297897,5214188,2013-06-18,6413018,Sharon,The flat was very comfortable and in an excellent location for getting to Ocean Beach Golden Gate Park and the N Judah trolley line.  Tim and his family were lovely hosts greeting us on our arrival and leaving us some much-appreciated breakfast foods and delicious coffee as well as a pass to the Academy of Sciences.  Our kids appreciated the bunk beds and  access to Netflix (as did we since our ordinarily early risers were up by 4:30-5:00 each day with the time difference from the East coast!)  Thank you for a great stay!  
9150693,143614134,2017-04-12,54054647,Molly,This was perfect for a quick trip to San Francisco. It was laughable how anywhere we wanted to go was just a short walk away! It was quiet and safe. 
3354928,179566152,2017-08-07,66109034,Francis,Great location beautiful building!
585326,59762850,2016-01-15,50776485,John,Su's place was above my expectations.  The accomendations were clean and quiet.  Parking was easy and public transportation a cinch.  I highly recommend Su.

20608059,246986401,2018-03-26,174286240,Carolyn,Carol's place is lovely VERY clean and SO convenient. The super easy check-in and out process and incredibly flexible check-in and out times really helped us out. Thanks for a great stay!
216064,499777960,2019-08-01,17577070,Ruth,Benjamin’s tour was one of our highlights of Paris. He is extremely knowledgeable and provided a tremendous amount of historical information in a short period of time. He was conscientious with details about meeting him including suggestions about the Metro. We became friends with the other guests. I highly recommend his tour.
11048759,209716977,2017-11-05,127920014,Taylor,Lovely little space. Comfy and modern. 
1624068,55677055,2015-12-04,28058238,Jasmine,The hotel was awesome and the room was better than expected. All the hotel staff were very friendly and the accommodations were good too. Plenty of restaurants and Chinatown within walking distance and just a couple blocks from union square.
883937,150638118,2017-05-08,14141322,Tyler,Awesome pad! Great location and a good home base to explore the Mission. Suzy was awesome super accommodating and very friendly. Thanks for everything!  
13333814,511714418,2019-08-17,151845059,Soumajyoti,The location is the best part. It is really peaceful and very clean. The room is a bit small compared to what you see and expect from the photos.
29018006,420164374,2019-03-05,73097144,Carlos,Sara’s communication was on point throughout the whole process. Super nice.

1605483,169520725,2017-07-12,2686396,Alex,I loved it as simple as that! Siobhann was an excellent host and gave me useful tips to go around SF for my first time in the city. Her place is nice and perfectly met my expectations. She offers all the amenities you can think of and even keeps some treats in a mini fridge in the room nice little touch right there! The room was clean the bed comfortable and I slept like a baby. PS: her cat is absolutely adorable and very cuddly it was a nice presence in the house!
30502421,463037542,2019-06-02,242172318,Salvador,This airbnb was amazing i felt at home! Micah was extremely helpful throughout everything. I would come to stay again in the future.
45299,402519,2011-07-28,462976,Christian,"This little studio is so wonderful. Very small. But so nice and clean. Very inviting. Centrally located. Like no really! You're at the edge of where the Castro meets the Mission District. Right on 18th St you can walk in either direction and find something to do or eat or drink or anything! Continue east down 18th and you will find Dolores Park for tennis or just sunning yourself with all of the locals just laying out having a nice time. Further down 18th you will find Valencia and Mission Streets for lots of funky and/or fine dining. And near by is Philz Coffee. Coffee made to order by a single pour. So Good!

Comfy studio has a lovely little court  yard and a washer and dryer if you need to use it. The studio looks just like the pictures and our hosts were so kind!

My only two notes on the place are these. 
1)The key to the front gate is tricky and needs to be jiggled or something. That having been said it's hard to tell which one is the key for the front gate. Between not being able to tell the keys apart and not being able to open the front gate when we had the right key in the lock we were left outside for a while late at night as we wrestled and wrestled with the keys and the gate and trying not to wake up or disturb the neighbors. So a little tag on the front key and a warning about the tricky key/lock would have helped us a lot. 

2)We were asked to do the laundry and clean the bed sheets before we checked out on our last day. Ya know for the price and the location this doesn't seem to unreasonable but I don't recall finding this in the original description and we sort of felt like this was sprung on us when we got there. So we had to delay our check out and change or morning plans just to do laundry. When I found the laundry room I realized it was the laundry for the whole property and every tenant had their own detergent marked for their own use. There didn't seem to be any detergent for the Comfy Studio itself. Well...maybe there was but it was not clearly marked. I went ahead and used someones detergent but felt weird about it.

Really this last part about the laundry is the only thing that made staying there a bit awkward and felt a bit ""taken"" by it. But I don't feel this was our hosts intentions at all. Just something that should be addressed for later Airbnbers.

Other than that I will totally recommend this place and Chas in the future!"
10193457,130885487,2017-02-09,69725681,Kelvin,The host canceled this reservation 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6365190,129414562,2017-01-30,650858,Bogdan,This place has perfect location. Everything is within reach and public transportation is fast to get you anywhere especially the BART trains. Warning: mister Chan wants to feed his guests. :) I really appreciated this though I preferred to eat outside because there's so much good food in San Francisco! Overall I had a wonderful time there.
14990478,400347301,2019-01-11,55238789,Maddy,One of the best air bnb’s I have stayed in. Beautiful personal touches and very comfortable space. Eddie and chip were very accommodating with the stay. Felt extremely safe. 10/10 overall
17222602,354437589,2018-12-01,27793916,Ming,The facilities in the gym center are amazing!
27725251,313042323,2018-08-24,36166391,Gloria,Kim's apartment was a dream and Eilien was so responsive and helpful. The location was perfect because being close to Caltrain was imperative to my stay. It also doesn't hurt that the apartment overlooks the entire skyline of San Francisco. I would stay there again in a heartbeat! 
17421876,204163665,2017-10-16,57988628,Sam,"Marina’s place is really great. From the point of booking she offers great communication. Check-in is also very efficient via a keypad system. 

While the studio is not right in the city as reflected by the price point it’s 20-30 minutes/ $10-15 in an UberPOOL to almost anywhere in the city. 

The extra little touches such as a coffee machine and Xbox were great and much appreciated. 

One slight issue for some travelers ( by certainly not for my cousin and I) was that the two beds may be too small for a couple. But in my opinion this is a rather minor compromise for such a fantastic place."
28733771,436306413,2019-04-12,237590054,Elina,For the firstimers in San Francisco Jessica’s place is perfect! Amazing location and everything near you could wish. You have your own peace in the room and it literally is exactly same as in the pictures. Clean quiet and lovely Airbnb!
16134193,131580130,2017-02-12,33287209,Caitlin,This was a beautiful and peaceful home in a wonderful location. We enjoyed exploring great restaurants and coffee shops in the neighborhood and loved the back patio! It was spotlessly clean modern and very comfortable. Totally recommend!!

4959980,293161743,2018-07-19,13246339,Wendy,Everything was easy about our stay. Check in help with museum passes questions during our stay... This was a great rental. The house is really clean and the extras of the pack n play high chair assortment of games and puzzles all made for a great stay with our family. I'd highly recommend staying here. There's a Safeway close by and lots of fun San Francisco adventures nearby. Thanks Tali! 
4439461,232419447,2018-02-04,152239672,Diana,Great location nice people who aim to please.
1336998,136966951,2017-03-12,109886520,Amanda,Doug and Richard were incredible hosts! We loved their hospitality and their home. Made our first Airbnb trip one to remember!
1281167,91027960,2016-08-03,81926862,Michelle,Such a great location and a great price in the middle of San Francisco. The hotel was comfortable the staff was friendly and the overnight parking (with in-and-out privileges as a guest) was so much cheaper than in other hotels I've been in. I would absolutely stay here again!
13901641,138830366,2017-03-21,26786363,Trenton,Highly recommended for a comfortable stay in SF that won't break the bank. The house is in a great quiet location and the room was super clean. Guanying was very hospitable and kind.
9650878,334642357,2018-10-09,54504700,Roger,Our stay with Carl was fantastic! The location is great - it's in a central spot of the city and has some great cafes and restaurants nearby. Carl was easy to communicate with and also had an extensive list of suggestions for things to do around San Francisco. I'd highly recommend staying here!
25634749,360477966,2018-12-20,217746575,辰辰 Billy,Great location beside the Golden Gate Park. Automatically check in and out.
16088064,145274644,2017-04-17,2252834,Kevin,"Pros: Joe's place was a perfect spot for our group. It's on the second floor of a building.  A full kitchen three bedrooms and enough beds for seven of us not to share! Three showers meant we didn't need to stagger wakeup times. Location was great. We walked to the waterfront Haight at AT&T park and the Caltrain. 

Cons: Not many but a couple of minor things. It has a large screen TV but content is streamed or through an antenna. Many channels but no sports (ESPN TNT or NBC). Lots of stairs to get to the unit so be aware if you have any mobility issues. 

Overall: 5 stars. Highly recommended."
1992217,31730607,2015-05-09,4160838,Celie,Peter's home is welcoming clean and tidy. The guest room has its own en suite bath and a balcony with a lovely view. The bed was very comfortable and the sheets and pillows were high quality. I was traveling for work and didn't get to spend much time with Peter but he always had a lovely breakfast of cereals and fruit waiting for me. I know he would've made me some of his famous french toast if only I didn't leave early each morning! 
4464347,564864620,2019-11-16,233998943,Alexis,Excelente atención
3761446,83595859,2016-07-03,43119954,Jacob,"Well there were ups and downs to say the least. 

The positives are they have a beautiful home in a fantastic location.

The negatives are they were not prepared to rent their home AT ALL. They left all personal belongings out. I'm talking about personal bills car keys clothes dirty towels toys clothes on the bed unmade bed and the list can go on. My family was very uncomfortable because it felt as if we walked in the front door as they left out the back. 

Overall Linda was very kind. Rob refused to answer me the second I voiced displeasure. 
It was not a great Airbnb experience BUT their home is beautiful and in a great location. I would not stay here again. "
23352511,402223014,2019-01-17,233942524,Olivier,"Both hosts are very welcoming. Their apartment is clean nicely located and spacious.

I was looking for an apartment for myself and this was the perfect choice."

1333047,557758498,2019-11-01,285062710,Isaiah,Graham's house is nice and very clean and the balcony provides a nice view. I have a minor cat allergy so I was a bit worried at first about the cats but the house was so clean that it was not a factor. Really close to the mission. Definitely hope to use it again the next time I'm in SF!
12741695,192089765,2017-09-09,143150926,Martina,This apartment was beautiful clean and full of modern technologies. I really recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice stay in west SF. We enjoyed it a lot.
12999869,206295393,2017-10-24,152743820,Wen,Very great place. The room is very clean and the decoration is unique and beautiful. I enjoy it very much. The construction noise is not loud and only appear during daytime. Sarah and Pankaj are very nice hosts. They response very fast without delay. You definitely should consider here when traveling in SF.
11494067,75399334,2016-05-21,9195692,Jamie,What a charming place! Catherine was very responsive and is a thoughtful and helpful host. I loved staying here! It was quiet and nicely decorated with comfortable modern pieces. The pretty little garden and lots of windows made me happy :) Thank you Catherine for the lovely stay!

16331804,152878852,2017-05-18,71318727,Anna,Kevin's home was affordable and clean. It is located close to public transit but took 45 minutes to an hour to commute to the city center.  Kevin was always available to answer questions and gave quick replies.

2046634,365870533,2019-01-01,216147137,Ran,Great hosts very helpful and quick response. The place is a little far from the touristy places takes about 30-40 min by bus. Room is not big but sufficient. No slippers. They provide good shampoo and conditioner. Kitchen is good too. If you want you can buy groceries nearby and cook yourself. Good A/C. Our room has a private bathroom. Another rooms share one bathroom. Overall positive.
21730409,426689588,2019-03-21,162763103,Radovan,Host is very kind he helped us with the parking. The house is located in the neighbourhood Richmond with the ideal position to Golden Gate Park and Golden Gate Bridge (both accesible by walk we did it). Also free water during stay with no extra charge was also really nice. Recommended!
9063798,262114243,2018-05-07,154063656,Nijel,The location of this spot is legendary. Close to everything you want to do. Really enjoyed walking around the hood in the morning. Room was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.
17979286,186887223,2017-08-25,37551782,Carmen,"If you think you know San Francisco you may want to guess again. This home is where you live when you're all grown up and like a more quiet space in a neighborhood with front yards.
I was blown away by this discovery and by how lovely this apartment was. The back garden is truly out of a magazine.
Carry on your luggage as your iron hair dryer huge closet with hangers etc. are all there for you. You don't even need a car as the bus stops right in front of the house. 
A true bed *and* breakfast with everything you can imagine. Including the kindest hosts!"
12590446,227696332,2018-01-15,70868174,Kristine,very private. Liked the use of real dishes.

You are t-e-r-r-i-f-i-c! Thanks for it all. 
One suggestion I’d instal a full length mirror somewhere."
13896608,178057488,2017-08-04,22865912,Melissa,Such a great place to stay when you're in the city and want to be able to easily access anything at anytime.  It was clean and communication was easy. I would highly recommend staying here whether your visiting for work or pleasure. Perfect spot if you want night life access but we had an infant so we didn't get to take advantage of that this trip.

18507951,177440529,2017-08-02,141063018,Michelle,The pictures do not give Diana's place justice! This little treasure was perfect. The bed was very comfortable the bathroom was clean and nice and the kitchen was stocked with breafast essentials. What I loved the most was how easy it was to get to places from Diana's place. Though parking can be a little tricky in this neighborhood it was very worth it.

713877,120876997,2016-12-12,48837237,Jurgen,The Location of this Air BB is beautiful & perfect itself walking distance to shops & cafe's but also to public transport to explore San Fancisco. The apartment itself is cosy and and very well equiped with a beautiful deck overviewing the city. The host Stacey was very helpful and easy to communicate with. When we left clothes she went all the way to send our stuff back overseas which meant a lot of time and effort from her side to get the big parcel send off by a courier which was all very amazing. Thank you again Stacey
4902729,137839209,2017-03-17,116618353,Sydney,Looks exactly like photos. Tony is really easy to get in touch with and is willing to work with you. Clean bedroom and bathroom. Location is great most attractions are in walking distance. Overall good experience.

25915813,297390057,2018-07-27,72521091,Sueyoung,Marlita and Luis are very kind super hosts. Also their house is very excellent and clean. It is even better than average hotels. Location is also good. If you have a car It is also convenient to visit some well known spots like Twin Peaks or Bay Bridge.

Any needs were promptly met.  "
109883,83177312,2016-07-01,76452240,Analilia,As soon as we set foot inside San Francisco Serenity we felt welcomed. The apartment exceed my expectations. We felt right at home. Adam and Joan are the perfect hosts. We had a customized passcode to enter the property which was great. There was a slight issue with one of the blankets but Adam was quick to resolve it no biggie. There was available free parking on the street which was great since we had a rental. Adam made some suggestions for restaurants which came in handy. If you can stop at Shaws on west portal for some candy and ice cream. It hit spot after dinner. Our stay was was amazing wish we could have enjoyed Adam and Joan's longer. 
1123125,307174839,2018-08-13,117531625,Amelia,Marion and her home are both amazing. The home is gorgeous and right outside a bus stop and up a block from a couple of cute shops and restaurants. Marion was extremely warm and helpful and even left us chocolates and wine. 
15330751,567870131,2019-11-23,9098285,Grace Juhae,Lovely clean home with a big room and comfortable bed to relax after  a long day. I really enjoyed staying with Jing and would recommend her place to my family and friends. She made me feel welcome and her cats are sweet addition!

16649876,407335486,2019-02-01,898789,Emily,Beautiful place with an artists touch!
32414,2449858,2012-09-29,3625957,Dhruva,"Nice cozy spot in Bernal Heights. The place is really well maintained and Lisa is a great host. All the key information was on the coffee table the place felt like it had just been cleaned and was easily accessible to the Mission via the 67 bus which goes right by the house. 
The only small downside is that you can hear everything on the street being right at street level but honestly this didn't really bother me and wouldn't affect my 5-star rating.
Decent food is down the street - not the best in SF where great food is aplenty but the selection is certainly solid. 
I spaced out and took the house key with me by accident after checking out and Lisa was very cool about letting me know and accommodating my schedule to get it back to her a few hours later in the day.  A great experience all around. Would definitely stay there again."
1995487,234706473,2018-02-13,64260372,Kriz,"Michael's place is amazing. The space is nicely designed and all details are attended to. I particularly loved the fireplace comes very handy in winter and it adds life to the room! Michael is very warm and welcoming and I am glad we met in person! He and Luis both made sure all my needs were taken care of so thank you both!
I would highly recommend this place to everyone :)"
1104362,357799220,2018-12-11,6429880,Charles,It was great to stay at Jan’s space again. The location was just wonderful on a beautiful short street which is very quiet.  The internal courtyard was delightful.  The design of the space was beautiful and the apartment looked out onto a wondrous garden with orange trees.
20269328,404877660,2019-01-25,34983314,Quinten,"Great location room was pleasant.
Friendly staff.
Place was old fashioned and a little rickety i happen to like that!
For that  price in SF  it is a good deal."

221342,19647623,2014-09-15,6031109,Vivian,We enjoyed our stay in Bill's suite. The bedroom & bath are very spacious & calm. The bed & pillows were very comfortable. Bill was a lovely host w/ ideas for dining. It is a great location for strolling around & exploring San Francisco. We felt very safe in the neighborhood. Beautiful view!
17271591,134885383,2017-03-01,57737638,Sven,We/ve been happy at all. Enjoyed our short stay. Location is awesome and perfect to stroll out to visit wonderful San Francisco.

7222704,210102854,2017-11-07,54238340,Maggie,I had a great stay here. The place was very clean and in a great neighborhood close to the beach and a nice walk to some really great views of the Golden Gate Bridge. The apartment was a bit chilly when I visited in early November so bring some sweatpants and a warm pair of socks! Overall this was a really great quiet place to stay. Dennis was also very accommodating and greeted us when we arrived and made himself available should we need anything during our visit.
28674015,546660715,2019-10-13,3731668,Eric,Clean affordable and Joey was a great host. Highly recommended

2123469,447498226,2019-05-03,198762,Todd,If you need a place to stay in the city for a few days Vivane & Lele's is a great spot very clean and has everything you'd need. The self check-in and out makes it super convenient for people like me who are traveling on weird schedules.
23222043,422735581,2019-03-11,7468670,Alli,"This apartment is spacious stylish and centrally located.  I love that it's a short walk to all that Hayes Valley has to offer (shopping great food Biergarten doggo park) and a short (uphill) walk to Safeway/Whole Foods and Duboce Park. It's easy to jump on the Muni F trolleys or 6/7 to get downtown.  I loved living in this apartment and was deeply saddened to leave!  I lived here for six months and while there was some construction it was always during the day (and I was at work).  Huge plus is that this apt is dog-friendly and my dog loved the giant window to observe all the comings and goings on Haight Street. 

11/10 would stay here again."
14401326,354408922,2018-12-01,115177558,Dr. Mary Kathleen (Kate),Kay and mark are super Superhosts! Great home top location loving care.

13127954,434839840,2019-04-08,14952016,Hareesh,Sarah and Pankaj were great! Really enjoyed staying at their place. They have a beautiful home.
3534282,199737583,2017-10-02,134542574,Afsheen,Right off of Valencia a convenient place to lay your head if you want to be in the heart of the Mission district.
1005642,401111040,2019-01-13,2647332,Sarah,Jan and Thriller the Cat are a delight!  Room is bright and bed was very comfortable.  Great place to crash in the evening if you have business in the city.  Location is the best part if you're an eater -- right around the corner from Bi-Rite Tartine and all the great restaurants on Valencia.
4387067,277169186,2018-06-15,11082209,Courtney,Beautiful listing and wonderful Host! I would absolutely stay at Jeffrey's Airbnb again and refer friends/family to as well!
5173043,68956701,2016-04-08,42413742,Lynn,We enjoyed our stay at the Wyndham Canterbury! We were warmly welcomed and given detailed information about the condo and the area we were staying in including recommendations for restaurants and sightseeing. Our condo was clean spacious and very comfortable. It was located near Union Square and we were able to walk to great restaurants. We would definitely stay here again. 
1535946,174084696,2017-07-24,19879701,Sisi,"Robert is a great host very detailed and nice to communicate. He replied us very quickly and always helpful to solve the problem.

The house is really convenient and near to the public transportation. We really like this house. What's more  he also provided a half cleaning for us which is really helpful when we stay with a baby.

We highly recommend this house to others in San Francisco.

Thanks for everything while our stay here."
4462326,76711388,2016-05-29,36054697,Jung,We stayed at Valerie's for 4 days. The place is only one block away from the bus stop (very convenient) you can take bus 24 to Castro and then take muni metro to places where you can catch buses to several popular tourist spots such as ferry building pier 39 union square Japan town or China town and many more depending on your trip schedule. Everything about the place was well kept and nice. Only one downside was that there was only one bathroom with shower so you may need to work your shower schedule with other guests. There were three other guests in the next room I had to wait over an hour to take shower in the morning. If you can wake up extra earlier then it'd be no problem. You can always communicate with Valerie through the app she usually responds back quickly whenever you need something or have questions to ask. Positive experience I would definitely want to come back and stay here again. 
13127954,246109229,2018-03-24,7039787,David,Terrific experience! Check in was super easy. The room and bathroom were very clean and well furnished & decorated. Would stay here again!

3416013,337864396,2018-10-17,55831342,Haytham,Great host .. Thank you Emily
5196399,53685766,2015-11-11,45068243,Hannah,I had a great time- comfortable bed plenty of space clean (especially the bathroom) and the location was great. Having a washer on the premises was another perk- I just wish I didn't bring my own towel because they had loads of clean ones to use! Generous and welcoming hosts that I'd recommend to anyone- thank you for letting me stay!
11225011,152639216,2017-05-17,53801153,Ryan,Beautifully minimal space with natural light from the garden. Perfect location in the Mission district and Michelle was very quick to reply when we had any questions. Would definitely stay again when we're next in SF!
9075976,304520309,2018-08-09,44085801,Helene,The home is well equiped and very nice to live in for a family. Quiet area. 
6688004,445166622,2019-04-28,38971030,Chuck,Linda was a wonderful host - considerate flexible and communicative.  All as advertised - very nice home with great surroundings.  Hope to be able to return to the  area soon - would definitely like to stay at Linda's again.

4483550,156729081,2017-05-31,51619829,Sarah,This place is fantastic.  Clean comfortable and well decorated.  Close to BART and muni shops and restaurants yet somehow quiet.  It had everything we needed for a family tourist trip to San Francisco.  
545685,3415544,2013-01-26,2544183,Bonnie,"I stayed at Linda's house for 7 nights.  It was right where I needed to be area wise (20 min walk) and the neighborhood is wonderful. Great restaurants and shopping.  I had everything I needed at Linda's minus a sponge for the dishes but made due.  She was very accommodating with my requests and left a lot of great information in the kitchen. It was great being able to come and go without thinking I was bothering anyone. In fact I never met Linda or her husband the whole time I was there. I felt like i was in Charlies Angels.  (sorry if you are too young to get that reference!).  The only complaint was the fridge made a loud clicking sound when the compressor went  on so I just unplugged it at night and it was no problem once I figured out what it was.  Very spacious and clean!
"
4269254,66992848,2016-03-26,50768486,Catherine,"Everything about our stay was excellent - Marjorie got in touch with us before our visit with all the information we would need and some really helpful restaurant recommendations. The apartment was the perfect size for us lovely and clean with high quality bathroom products and numerous San Francisco guide books as well as other books and DVDs. 

The location of the apartment was great we were able to walk around most of the city from the location and were right in the heart of Japantown. 

If we ever return to San Francisco we would certainly stay here again!"
1750093,329402289,2018-09-28,3397633,Memo,Wasn't sure what to expect for my first time renting a room as opposed to a whole home/unit. My experience was great and always felt welcomed by Daniel and family. Highly recommended.

23521739,450984293,2019-05-10,201549145,Tamara,I enjoyed my stay here James was a very good host and had great communication. The room itself was modern comfortable and clean and the apartment offered everything you could need during your stay here my personal favourite being the coffee machine!
2104437,161099020,2017-06-16,636269,Pauline,My stay was fine. He is a nice guy but he was away. Shared rooms could have been cleaner in particular the shower and bathroom which had hair all over and the room which had leftover wrappers (maybe from the previous guest?) but I booked same-day so could have been because no cleaner was available that day. 
8739,231520447,2018-02-01,61731362,Emmanuel,Very warm welcome in charming place and a great location in the Mission
20408154,302516779,2018-08-05,36169217,Gina,This is a great place to stay in San Francisco! Lynn and Ray are great communicators with quick responses and clear instructions. Check in is super easy and gives you a lot of flexibility planning your day. The space is clean and bright well equipped and well labeled. I definitely recommend staying here during your visit to San Fran! 
2432104,46702137,2015-09-13,19644000,Marine,La maison de Jennifer est située dans un quartier résidentiel très calme et bien desservi par les transports en commun (ligne KT pour aller à Downtown). Il y a des supérettes à proximité et plusieurs laveries. La chambre est très confortable avec un lit confortable un bureau et un placard et elle donne sur le jardin. Nous avions une salle de bain et une cuisine bien équipée pour notre usage personnel. Jennifer est très attentionnée et fait tout pour nous mettre à l'aise. Nous nous sommes senties comme chez nous pendant notre séjour. C'était parfait. Marine

654279,270642429,2018-05-29,122791574,Jonathan,It‘s an amazing room in a friendly home. Chris and Tim are very helpfull and kindly hosts. This is a perfect place stay in san francisco. 
1992217,567551598,2019-11-22,2399211,P Janine,Traveling with my friend who mostly stayed here and I stayed at night with a nearby cousin but we met in the mornings for a lovely coffee and muffin service on the balcony from our host with the most sweeping views! So according to her the bed wraps you up like a cozy bundle and as the location is high it feels like you’re sleeping on a cloud. It’s also incredibly clean and with a great host. Note there is a dog on premises. We didn’t see it and it’s not in your space but will bark now and then - important to know the layout - you are staying in one of two bedrooms in a shared flat with a common area and kitchen. The host is in the next room. Your bathroom is private as you have the master suite. It’s a quiet space and requires a stair climb. We appreciated the availability of the host who always provided clear instructions and supportive information. Recommend.
21909473,324726014,2018-09-17,188103341,Ian,"Great location excellent apartment for two people. Well equipped kitchen with a lovely bathroom and comfy bed.
Communication with Phyllis prior to visit was excellent with helpful tips on how to get from the airport to the house. We only met Phyllis briefly on arrival the rest of the communication was done via text.
The apartment is situated close to the Muni and a few blocks from a BART station which gets you into downtown San Francisco in about 30 minutes.   After exploring the neighbourhood we found some excellent little shops cafes and bars. We walked to the Mission district and got the bus up to the Castro and found some great restaurants.
The only issue we had was with the welcome pack - it had no information on local amenities such as a map travel info supermarkets bars and restaurants.  As new visitors to SF it would have been helpful to have some basic information that would have saved us time.  The pack was one page of basic instructions and then the rest were pages on how to recycle.
As first time Airbnb guests it was a very good first experience and we would recommend using this apartment for your stay in San Francisco."
15330751,505787602,2019-08-09,3678049,Eva,Jing’s space was clean and lovely and the bed was incredibly comfortable! Her cats especially Coco were also amazing. Would definitely stay here in the future!

21650740,289607029,2018-07-12,121408970,Chris,Loved Servio’s place.  In spite of being in a “flat” of sorts it was very private and easy to access.  Cool little neighborhood and much more than you would ever get from  hotel.  Servio could not have been a better host and responded to questions and requests immediately.  Very very happy overall.
22563498,518492203,2019-08-26,183785448,David,I had a wonderful experience while staying at Jenny’s place. She is the best Air B&B host I’ve ever had.
7026287,520053377,2019-08-29,65572922,Laurie,A really nice time spending at Melissa & Nicole place. The room is clean confortable and well located. We enjoyed our few days in San Francisco and highly recommend Melissa & Nicole who are adorable. If we come back to SF we will definitely choose this place!

5007358,307447772,2018-08-14,9515711,Wyatt,"Communication with Tony was quick and easy. This is where it ends. The rest is a headache.

Unfortunately Tony's place is misrepresented with the photo. The photo of the bed which looks nice presents the space as modern and clean. It is not modern nor is it clean. As soon as you enter the main door to the building you are faced with a long and narrow flight of stairs and you have two flights to navigate - if you're carrying a large or heavy suitcase this place is not for you. I discovered my room was also the ""Fire Escape"" as indicated on the door with the large red and white sign. I entered the single room turned on the light switch to see insects scurry around the floor and out the door. (Never had I such an experience with Airbnb.) I opened another small door which was the bathroom and looked in the shower - it was stained with mold and soap scum. To put it lightly - the place is nothing short of headache. The noise outside the window was loud and if I were to close the window the room would have been too hot - it was already quite warm in the room and it did not have air-conditioning. I could not stay in this place - I left immediately found a hotel and cancelled my Airbnb reservation.

I contacted Airbnb support and Tony via Airbnb email and I have not heard from either - this surprises me. I have used Airbnb for several years and this is my first poor experience with a stay and with Airbnb. I cannot say anything positive about this experience.

Let's see if Airbnb will post this message.

786506,504483826,2019-08-07,78020427,Liz,Really lovely hostel! Super affordable for a SF trip.
13602723,360475506,2018-12-20,61099853,Inès,Great place- really comfortable. Kate and her husband were very welcoming. Would definitely stay here again!
14538591,141337844,2017-04-02,27503642,Alejandra,The location is great. It is very close to ocean beach as well as public transportation making it very easy to get into the main attractions of the city.  It is also steps away from Golden Gate Park which could take days to stroll through. Paulina and Ashley were very receptive and available when any issues came up.  The main issue is that the unit is directly below a common area of the main house which probably has hardwood floors. There was constant noise between 7 and 9 AM and you could hear everything from people running up and down children crying and what I assume were dogs running back-and-forth and things being dropped on the floor.  If you are trying to sleep in it will be impossible unless you are a very deep sleeper. I would recommend this place if you are on a budget and are only going to be there for a couple of nights otherwise look elsewhere. 
470686,37913812,2015-07-11,37407190,Thomas,This was my first Airbnb experience. It was great. I was only there to sleep and shower. The few minutes I saw Hao he provided useful advice about the city. I would definitely rent from him again.
10418322,452294364,2019-05-12,196839896,Calvin,The host was very accommodating the room was designed well and the location was ideal.
34228309,517824692,2019-08-25,121770072,John,Jordan’s place is fantastic! It is on the top floor on a beautiful quiet street in Pacific Heights with great light and views to the south. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated formal but comfortable. The kitchen is huge and well equipped. The house was spotless with nice and thoughtful amenities. The private entrance leads to a fairly steep staircase so guests need to be ok with that. Overall a perfect stay - great location lovely home gracious hosts.
3441517,279140331,2018-06-19,44911833,Sean,Judy was a great host. We were met upon arrival and given fresh bagels and coffee. Judy was great at explaining the apartment amenities and has a real passion for San Francisco which comes across when she gives advice of places to see and where to eat. The apartment itself is out of the centre of San Fran but Uber is a great cost effective way to get around. Would definitely recommend Judy’s apartment for a stay in San Francisco.
9605720,209721697,2017-11-05,65985739,Andrew,This place has the most amazing view -- it's really unbeatable for San Francisco. the pics are an accurate reflection of the flat. I love being in Chinatown as well -- I like the feel of the place.  This is a very central location and you can reasonably walk to a lot of the city from here --- of course public transportation is also quite easy in San Francisco.  I enjoyed using the Miele coffee machine the flat is nicely appointed and very comfortable.  The best of all is sunrise -- to watch the light slowly creep over the city is quite a site from this elevated position. You can clearly see Alcatraz the Bay Bridge Coit Tower and the Transamerica building. Check in was simple communication with Adrian was easy although I really didn't need anything because instructions were clear. I would definitely stay here again.
12905538,572015008,2019-12-01,22695206,Rachelle,Freya’s place fit all of our needs perfectly! The beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped and had a lot of condiments. The notes around the house were really helpful so that we knew how everything works.  We also were happily surprised at how close it was to the beach. We enjoyed watching the sunset and the surfers. Freya’s communication was great and she responded to our messages right away. We can’t wait to stay here again!

20695687,491141020,2019-07-19,50367737,Lani,Tyler's home was a breath of fresh air after staying in a hotel in downtown Union Square. Slightly far distance wise from the things we wanted to do but Mission is close for food and night life if you don't have a car

My bedroom was beautiful and really comfortable perfect to have some rest after a day of visiting SF. My best Airbnb experience !

727866,55225235,2015-11-29,32759494,Trisha,This was my first time using airbnb and Kevin & Esther couldn't have been more welcoming!! They are genuinely good hearted people ❤️ Their studio was relaxing beautiful and wonderfully located. I had no trouble finding parking in their peaceful neighborhood. My only regret is that I didn't plan to stay longer. I would definitely stay here again! 
29062428,560437329,2019-11-06,108061203,Maddison,Great stay
2665028,71030969,2016-04-23,33865061,Geraldine,I stayed at Jon's for 4 weeks and had a very comfortable and overall great stay. Jon was extremely attentive with anything I needed and catered to any requests I had. He responds very quickly so you always feel very well looked after. I felt at home here and loved the location probably the most being surrounded by so many great cafes and restaurants. I felt very safe too being on my own the neighbourhood has a great vibe & atmosphere. His space is large with lots of natural light plus an added bonus of the balcony off the living area. Kitchen and bathrooms are great modern & clean with necessary cooking utensils. He has free wifi which is obviously very helpful too. I was too busy with work to enjoy the rooftop but it's a great space also with panoramic city views. I would highly recommend staying here you won't be disappointed. 
164207,2424904,2012-09-26,3499718,Serena,Phil is the perfect host- thoughtful interesting and with tonnes of local knowledge. The room was great with loads of guidebooks and leaflets towels and loads of useful items like a hair dryer and tablet to help with online bookings etc. 
17408793,171731896,2017-07-18,1261168,Richard,Peter's apartment is in a great location; near transit and close to Ocean Beach and Golden Gate Park. The apartment has all of the basics you need and is clean and comfortable.
9837993,280674881,2018-06-23,173351250,Isabelle-Anne,Very lovely apartment easy access clean and quick response from Donald.
19180222,202756024,2017-10-12,102714522,Julian,Great stay with great hosts! If I am in the area in the future will definitely try to stay with them again and can wholeheartedly recommend to others.
5068486,519501757,2019-08-28,10301270,Massimiliano,This home is the top I can imagine for visiting San Francisco: amazing in a very nice neighborhood close to public transports with a very nice garden. It’ very well organized and with all the stuff you may need and even more. Karen left in the house all kind of food you can need for breakfast  It isn't just a stay it is really staying at “home”.   You can find all the information about S. Francisco and Karen is so helpful if needed. All that books in the shelves are something that help you to feel confortable in it.
3123536,45290910,2015-09-01,32540097,Hanna,"We had a FABULOUS experience at Lanalee's! She took care of me and my family in a way I never had expected. My 6 month old daughter now have a new aunt and we have new friends :) 
The room is very nice with comfy bed and wonderful view we also really appreciated that it was so big. The area is nice and felt very safe. 
You can really feel like you're at home when you are here! 
I want to go back to SF soon again mostly to catch up with Lanalee! "

Stacey's advices were very useful"
6272816,139496760,2017-03-25,71219470,Long,We had a pleasant stay at Praise's apartment while exploring San Francisco. The place is a short walk to public transportation and getting to downtown SF is under 20 minutes. It is in convenient neighborhood with some great restaurants nearby.
23522934,407311581,2019-02-01,51191407,Heo,It was nice place.
4033038,508341634,2019-08-12,260608417,Stephanie,We had a wonderful family weekend in Simone's home. We played chess we grilled on the BBQ and we easily accessed public transit and delicious local restaurants. We loved it! We highly recommend Simone as a host as well as this location for a family trip to San Francisco.
13796921,548473082,2019-10-17,2113984,Cormac,Nice compact immaculately tidy space. Friendly welcome when I arrived.

18550910,483672468,2019-07-07,12962850,Amelia,Joe's place worked out really well for me and my travel partner. Check-in was super easy and the apartment was spacious light filled and immaculate. It was very close to a very active part of Haight Street which worked out well for us too. I also enjoyed talking to Joe about urban planning and history in the San Francisco!
3043102,295987414,2018-07-24,1463301,Deidre,Jed's place was amazing!  Two blocks away from the beach and park.  Easy walk to public transit.  The place is open and airy and neighborhood is safe with lots of cool restaurants down the street.  Jed is a great host!  You need to stay at his place when heading to San Francisco!!!  Yay!!
15733592,120091663,2016-12-07,9979843,Slawomir,This place has everything that I needed full kitchen a lot of space for sleeping and eating as well as a desk for working. Dave is a great host very responsive and helpful. Location is great in the heart of North Beach and at the same time insulated from all the activities due to the location at the end of the closed street. Great value and surely a place I would like to stay in again.
4417901,50049820,2015-10-08,45689895,Karin,Nice place and helpful staff. Breakfast allright but not awesome. You hear your neigbhours.

12835527,277606005,2018-06-16,180276728,Hannah,Das Apartement ist sehr schön und gemütlich eingerichtet. Es ist alles da was man braucht. Die Gastgeber sind sehr nett und hilfsbereit und haben gute Tips parat. Die Lage ist in einem schön gelegenen Stadtteil und man kommt schnell mit Bus und Bahn überall hin. Wir können dieses Apartment nur sehr empfehlen. Viel schöner als in einem Hotel.
12515810,193730450,2017-09-14,27554005,Emma,Great location! We were here for a business trip for a few days and this was a perfect spot to get to where we needed. Easy to find. Nicely designed. Quiet part of town. VERY clean. The only negative is the parking (which we didn't find a problem but others may); one hour parking during the day on the weekdays and there wasn't any A/C which is common in the bay area so it was expected but we had to open the window at night which made me worry because we had very expensive gear/equipment with us. Otherwise incredibly easy check in with a key lock there's a market next door so you can grab anything you need and great food nearby. Would stay here again!!
884770,11404861,2014-04-01,5431556,Julia,Great host good location. Overall I had a great stay at Sandra's place in Russian Hill!
5253439,132381986,2017-02-17,57884272,Eugene,"Duncan was an amazing home with great Intel on the Mission district and all its gems.

During my stay here I met about a dozen new people and all with great stories as this is a perfect setting for travellers looking to meet others. 

Roux is a friendly dog who stayed awake with me during late hours when it got quite and is totally lovable. 

If you want a friendly stay in the middle of the lively city this is definitely the place!!"
4463165,54446608,2015-11-20,27896141,Mike,Quiet comfortable great location. Valerie is a gracious host!
13815533,251872005,2018-04-08,20289245,Sandi,We really enjoyed our stay. While this is not in the center of the city it is within walking distance of the beach and close to Golden Gate Park. Beautifully appointed and peaceful.
2046807,37697054,2015-07-09,15873407,Janet,Kevin was a great host and the place was perfect. He was very quick to respond with any questions and the use of the garage space for our rental car was an added bonus. The space is basically just like having your own hotel room. It was very clean and comfortable. It is so close to so many amazing restaurants that it doesn't even matter there is no kitchen. It's the perfect spot for a short stay in San Francisco. Definitely recommend this place!
8172628,332610914,2018-10-05,93788562,Sion,Susan is the one of the kindest most considerate people that we have ever met. We spent a few days at Susan's place and it was a very pleasant and comfortable experience. She went out of her way to make us feel at home. The location is great as well and I highly recommend Susan's place for any future SF trips.
545585,31055708,2015-05-01,30311080,Ryan,Much thanks to Jose for the hospitality and use of the beautiful Nob Hill condo.  Everything was perfect.  The condo is in a great location to get to just about anything in the city and has fantastic views!
4949779,120947977,2016-12-12,85020356,Guilherme,It was my first experience with airbnb. Before arriving the house I was a little bit worried to stay in a unknown place.  However my first airbnb let me so surprised positvely! Maryam was lovely and make me feel in my ouwn home. Ambrish was very helpful and always ready to offer fast solutions when I needed. The house is very clean and silent.  There's a beuatiful  terrace outside with   trees and plants. Other gests  I met was so polited also. My room was big and there was frigobar and heater.  Thus I have to give congratulations to them and thanks for everything they have done for me.  Moreover I hope to see them again in Brazil ou USA.

27260835,331124867,2018-10-01,26816597,Claudia,"Great location near Ocean Beach. Lots of cute restaurants and bars nearby. The studio was clean. The bed was rather hard-I would add a memory foam mattress topper. Note in the picture there is just one small upholstered chair for relaxing. The accessible backyard looks cute and inviting from the window but when we went out there to eat a sandwich let's just say that the dog had made several ""visits"" and the yard had not been cleaned up. On a positive note when I let Joya know that the brand new air mattress had failed to stay inflated for more than a couple of hours she was kind enough to offer me a refund as compensation."
21650740,568793758,2019-11-24,20060479,Taylor,Very clean space very helpful host!
640352,21326268,2014-10-14,1776844,Matt,"We rented Jessica and Steven's place to use as a workspace to launch a new product over a four day period. 

We had a great stay and the couches kitchen and shower were all amazing.

I'd definitely recommend the space for offsites with teams or for startups looking for a hacker house for a weekend."

4105892,232857010,2018-02-06,16263212,Yuge,Skate and Jeannie's place is truly one of a kind. The house has the most beautiful backyard where you'll have access to a view of San Francisco's magnificent skyline. The rooms are very clean and stylish. Skate and Jeannie are warm and responsive. One of my best Airbnb experiences!
1421937,219537452,2017-12-17,37910656,Jennyane,This was my second stay at Dee’s house. It was a whirlwind of a trip (only two days!) but Dee made our stay very pleasant and comfortable. Everything was on point (i.e. booking process checking-in communication with Dee amenities local tips etc.). What you see is what you get! We are so glad that Dee’s Airbnb room (booked same room as last time) was available for the trip. Merry Christmas! Happy travels!
4387067,96620687,2016-08-23,57900284,Ashley,The hosts gave us recommendations on restaraunts and attractions that we found very helpful. Let us leave our bags when we arrived early and made our stay very enjoyable. 
13857866,98703897,2016-09-01,13787516,Colette,Great space in a prime location to explore the best parts of the city. Kate was hospitable and responsive and her local tips were helpful and spot on.

It had everything I needed for a work trip and I hope to be able to stay here again in the future!!

Terry cared about us and replyed to me so I think he is very reliable."

29924753,510187037,2019-08-15,130763298,Andreina,Nice and comfortable place to stay for a visit to San Fran. Host was helpful and responsive. Close to transportation and it’s a quick ride into downtown.
24463,159115263,2017-06-09,2168371,Isaac,Such an incredible view apartment and host. Highly highly recommend. Cathryn was friendly and engaging and her place has all the amenities that you could need. It was pretty easy and cheap to uber places and nice to come back to after a day of work or sightseeing. Plus her balcony gives you the perfect view of Karl the Fog!
2948159,286239736,2018-07-05,184110111,Judy,This condo is wonderful.  It is centrally located so easy to get to all the sites.  The view was absolutely beautiful when the fog cleared.  It had everything we needed for a great stay.  It was nicely decorated clean and spacious.  
748256,35683348,2015-06-21,5412773,Mellisa,Great room great amenities great condo! Michael and Yesica's home is absolutely beautiful from their custom lamps to their collage canvases of their different vacations. We met Yesica upon arrival and we were able to drop off some stuff before official check-in. She was very helpful and provided us with directions to BART (very close) and suggestions for things to see and places to eat. We met Michael briefly and he was welcoming and friendly. Because of our busy schedules we were not able to spend much time in the condo aside from sleeping but there's a nice living room area to relax and watch TV and roof access. Overall a great stay and I would stay here again!
39418,54306251,2015-11-18,29539327,Melissa,This is a great option for anyone looking for a quiet place to stay with easy accesss to public transport. There are many dining options within walking distance and downtown is jst a short BART ride away. Therese and Nelson were wonderful hosts and made me feel very welcome during my four month stay here. I highly recommend this apartment and this neighbourhood. It has everything you need for a short or longer stay.
2948159,163983358,2017-06-25,51257334,Bill And Sue,Stefan's apartment was very nicely decorated comfortable and clean. Stefan was a great host and was extremely accommodating. The apartment has nice views of the city below. Thanks for an enjoyable stay. 
5094146,28536883,2015-03-25,2321786,Sean,"Abhay was a great host... and his was a warm and welcoming home. The apartment itself was in a great safe neighborhood and I really enjoyed Abhay's friendly dog who was affectionate (and surprisingly quiet and well-behaved given how happy he was to see me).

The apartment was extremely neat and as a person who is interested in good design I felt very appreciative of the details and decorations of the house which felt both comfortable and aesthetically pleasing.

The keyless door entry system was the best I've used on Airbnb... very easy to come and go."
8030646,450576938,2019-05-09,109872613,Charlotte,The bed was SO comfortable and Kurya the cat was lovely and friendly. There’s a chalkboard in the common area with some chalk for guests to use which was a nice unique touch
1206184,234154877,2018-02-11,107551594,Kevin,Easy checkin and great location.  Separate rooms for tub/shower and toilet is also a plus
13669721,168936793,2017-07-10,64954727,Terri,What delightful hosts and an exquisite home to spend an entire week in SF for our daughter's wedding. The house is immaculate with everything you need for a delightful stay. We hosted a dinner for 5 where we cooked the entire meal in the kitchen. Another meal was catered but we were able to host 11 with the owner's approval. Our last dinner in the home we hosted 7 of us comfortably in the dining room with pizza from Gialini's in Glen Park. With an incredible view my 83 year old mother was not able to negotiate the hills for the mile walk into Glen Park but Uber provided easy transportation back. This was the best experience we've had with Airbnb!
4948340,254707821,2018-04-17,149071991,Daniele,L'abitazione si trova in una buona posizione (circa 30 min di autobus dal centro) in un quartiere con tutte le comodità (bar ristoranti negozi...); tuttavia la casa benché pulita è molto vecchia e senza riscaldamento quindi non proprio accogliente. Vanno riconosciute comunque a Budi la sua gentilezza e disponibilità ed il fatto che a quel prezzo difficilmente troverete di meglio a San Francisco.

Donna was great communicating with us both before and during our stay and made us feel very welcome.  The apartment was beautiful with lots of light clean well appointed with everything we needed quiet very convenient to shops etc. within walking distance and very close to the ""J"" for public transportation.  We also enjoyed the courtyard watching the (outside) cats and the birds at the feeder."

6505426,99927186,2016-09-06,30412579,Jessica,Communication leading up to the trip was easy and the space was wonderful - super cute decor neat and functional. We stayed with our friends who stayed in one room while we slept in the other. There was just enough separation between the two spaces for a balance of fun with friends and privacy. The neighborhood was also great - a quick walk to many brunch spots that we enjoyed both mornings we were in town. Thanks for the great stay!
8051735,53422655,2015-11-08,4755601,Heather,"Angeline was a great hostess! My husband and I along with another couple stayed at the house and there was plenty of room for all of us. The house is in a great location  minutes from restaurants coffee shops grocers  walking/biking trails beach etc.

We had one technical issue with the heater while we were there on the first night and Angeline was there within minutes to have it fixed. "

581216,283388567,2018-06-29,21080411,Paul,"This is a great location. We walked to the warf area each day ambling through Fort Mason and drinking in views of the bay. 

We have been to many places where shampoo and toilet paper and salt were either not provided or in seriously limited supply. Not here great amenities including most spices anyone could want nicely scented body wash large bath towels etc. etc. Even coffee and filters.

There were three young boys (11 12 and 13) with us and the space worked perfectly."
8974563,225522923,2018-01-06,128630139,Brian,Craig was very helpful via text. We weren't able to see Craig until the last day but yet still Craig's ability to keep in touch via text give parking suggestions and being open to communicate made the stay really easy. This is a great place in a wonderful neighborhood close to a lot of fun things.
13083682,427062450,2019-03-22,234321906,Xavier,It's a great stay with Lyle and the  next GDC I'd love to come back here.

many thanks for a great stay at your house. I love the house style and the views and lights are really exceptional. Every details is very well thought out and i wish i could for 3 months rather than 10 days!

7987618,96021161,2016-08-21,26468797,Maikel,Very warm and caring host who makes you feel right at home! I would come back in a heartbeat.
748222,552527833,2019-10-21,107291182,Steven,Great place extremely clean and nicely furnished!!!
3811916,73438233,2016-05-08,2618387,Christopher,Amanda made us feel very welcome and her flat was exactly what we hoped!  The little kitchen worked great for making breakfasts and the bed was very comfortable.  She was also very helpful with our departure: she let us leave our bags there and even keep the key well after checkout until it was time to leave for the airport.
2496086,73666085,2016-05-09,23355598,Susan,Victor hosted us so well. His home is clean and convenient to both the airport and downtown SF.  We enjoyed our days in SF. 
4093967,186179069,2017-08-23,37215185,Dana,Das Haus von Jeannie und Skate ist ein atemberaubendes Kunstwerk! Es gibt jeden Tag etwas Neues zu entdecken. Sie haben sich so viel Mühe bei kleinsten Dingen gegeben. Die Aussicht auf San Francisco war einmalig. Empfehlenswert ist den morgendlichen Kaffee auf einen der verschiedenen Ebenen im Garten zu sich zu nehmen. Skate und Jeannie waren immer für ein nettes Gespräch und super Tipps offen. Danke für alles wir haben uns wie Zuhause gefühlt! Gerne kommen wir wieder!
6529234,139497306,2017-03-25,114074436,Dominique,I stayed with my 15 year old son at Adrian's place and we loved it! The studio is very comfortable and clean in a quiet neighborhood close to the park and also close to the bus line. Adrian left coffee tea milk cereal and fruits for us to enjoy the first morning we really appreciated that! Everything was perfect! I highly recommend staying there!
5904305,349221209,2018-11-16,67599662,Sarah,Sebastian was a great host.  I appreciate his streamlined check-in. The room was clean and bright. And the apartment was well located. Highly recommend.

6120540,495882089,2019-07-26,212395629,Shan,Not my cup of tea. That said it is not a bad place at all and is hosted by the kindest person ever - Pam. Despite being late she was always up to help and went the extra mile by doing my laundry! Perhaps I prefer places that are more modern. The wifi can lag if you close the door to the room. All in all great place!
26566885,527378247,2019-09-10,109229260,Matthew,Cozy room good location and a VERY accommodating host. Went out of her way to ensure I had everything I needed while in town for business. Thanks!
21730409,476233615,2019-06-25,12383959,Giuliano,Clean quiet greatly connected through public transportation also not far away from the beautiful Golden Gate Park. Had a great stay in one of Alex’s rooms and he’s been extremely nice and welcoming the whole time. A good base to explore the city!
499096,148007997,2017-04-29,118910358,Dee Ann,Ingrid's place is extremely clean and very quiet because it is back from the street. Fast internet firm bed nice hot water and great water pressure  -- 4 things that are important to me. Check in and out went off without a hitch. Ingrid was easy to keep in touch with via text messaging and very friendly as well as helpful. Washer and dryer appeared to be new and worked well. There are lots of great restaurants within walking distance (Ingrid provides a good list) as well as small stores that sell food. If I'm back in the area I'll try to rebook with Ingrid.
9075976,311167344,2018-08-20,7663433,Richard,"We have just had the perfect trip to SF - thanks to Read’s place! Staying in Read’s house was brilliant for many reasons. The house is extremely spacious and comfortable and so well equipped it is truly a home from home. Our family of 4 including our two adult children settled right in and immediately felt we had the ideal base from which to explore SF. The house was spotlessly clean with everything we needed. Pounce the cat was a real added bonus - he’s a very relaxed friendly dude and helped give that homely feel. 

The location is excellent. Outer Sunset is a really quiet safe place to stay in but with loads of local amenities - easily found thanks to Read’s comprehensive house info (and excellent communication). But it is also on several public transport routes directly into downtown SF that are incredibly cheap and efficient. AND... the Ocean! Ocean beach is beautiful.

Finally Read was an outstanding host. Really quick to communicate support and advise and extraordinarily proactive in making sure our stay was perfect. Check-in was smooth the house/local info was clear and detailed and the info to look after Pounce made it very very easy and enjoyable.

I cannot recommend Read’s place highly enough. If we are ever lucky enough to get back to SF we will definitely book Read’s again. Thank you Read.

19015884,250959088,2018-04-06,65952822,Erica,My second time staying here such a lovely place. I often travel to SF for business and this is always my first choice! Jennifer and Henry are extremely hospitable nice and such great hosts! I recommend this to any business traveler or a duo traveling to SF!

1556680,101068166,2016-09-11,56769183,Jon-Michael,We loved our stay David the host was great. We want to visit again!
3333870,86885405,2016-07-17,15181805,John,The location and the facilities are first rate.  I plan to stay again during my next visit to San Francisco.
394575,17614831,2014-08-15,6359658,Deborah,My guest had a great time in this unique and cozy flat. Thanks Mike and Nic!
1336998,64234972,2016-03-01,21128521,Alice,Doug and Richard made us feel very much at home. In our sunny private room there were beautiful Cala lilies from the garden. The bed and linens were incredibly comfortable and the location of the room makes it very private from the rest of the house. It's quite a large room with a nice round table several chairs and plenty of space to spread out. There's a private garden in the back with a gas fireplace and comfy furniture which Doug and Richard encouraged us to use- and we did! Two friendly cats will welcome you again giving you the feeling you are right at home. A pretty dining room is always set up with the makings for fresh coffee and tea fruit granola and yogurt. We will definitely plan to stay again with Doug and Richard. 
31888526,500188566,2019-08-01,56136141,Janaye,Katherine's place is glorious!  I loved every minute staying there.  It was quaint and cozy near a lot of great restaurants and a gym that I love.  It was really quiet and the space is really stylish.  Katherine even left me some treats upon check-in.  I would definitely stay again.
16737908,442909694,2019-04-24,74897248,Jason,If you want to experience the Mission District in SF this is the place to stay. Donna and Doug provided great recommendations their place was stunning and in the heart of the Mission District without being on the strip itself. I was able to walk to the BART every day with no problem so getting around the city was a breeze from their location. Very clean place and a private bathroom make this a definite must stay spot!
31120211,554614861,2019-10-26,201978708,Joanna,Cyn’s place is an awesome value for being right in the city of San Francisco with the added bonus of free and easy street parking. Great safe location near tons of shops restaurants and activities. Her place offered ample space and amenities for our family and was very stylish to boot. Cyn was awesome in communicating with and accommodating us.
2710372,70718575,2016-04-20,5214697,Robin,The apartment was in a perfect location! Close to great shopping and restaurants; all within walking distance. The apartment was spacious had everything you would need for a most comfortable stay. The host Raja was fantastic. He was prompt in answering questions and seeing to our needs and requests. I couldn't have asked for a better more responsive host. We had a car but parking really was not a problem we found parking every night right in front of the apartment. Two gas stations close by. I look forward to going back again and again. 
21161595,567494901,2019-11-22,33505416,Michael,Claudia is a great host. Everything was exactly as listed. She is also very quick to respond to queries. Claudia went the extra mile to make us comfortable during our stay.
29002725,338161142,2018-10-18,219304475,Colleen,Excellent communication exactly what a business person or traveler would need for a short term stay.
6560870,182490674,2017-08-14,129905115,Lauren,Very modern clean & comfortable. We really enjoyed staying there and all of the comforts of home that were provided for us. Other than check in we didn't even see Sage & Babs. It was like staying in a vacation villa!
713877,121260174,2016-12-15,64594912,Tiffany,A real San Franciscan experience. Stacy's place was everything we imagined. Yes there were plenty of stairs to contend with but the views from the rooftop deck and out of the bedroom window were fabulous. Plenty of room for the 6 of us. The only problem was we didn't stay long enough for my 3 boys to each get a turn sleeping 'in the cupboard'. They thought this was fantastic.
15055277,343485161,2018-10-31,178012615,Grayson,super great place to sleep on a budget. If you're not hanging out in your place it's perfect. Used it for business travel and was fantastic.
59344,17641616,2014-08-15,2470792,Jaakko,A great place and location for exploring the best parts of San Francisco. Really nice neighborhood. John was very helpful and for example we could leave our bags safe at his house after the check out so we could explore the city some more before our late evening flight. All in all a great experience.
4678599,201702845,2017-10-08,152920642,Miles,Fantastic property book it if you have the chance!
17371171,554127946,2019-10-25,168158731,Jevon,Great stay as usual!!

2178509,421145647,2019-03-08,239962867,Tom,Would stay again - great host. Location has easy access to city but great local restaurants as well.
2315086,13239576,2014-05-23,12885381,Sarah,First of all the house was lovely with really comfortable beds. It was clean and tidy and fresh towels were provided for us as well. The house is in a really nice and safe location. It was also close to some really delicious restaurants and the Palace of Fine Arts. Renee and Ron are some of the loveliest people I've ever met and made us all feel very welcome. They have the cutest dog too. Thank you for everything Renee and Ron! We'll definitely stay with you again whenever we go back to San Francisco! 
137546,508976061,2019-08-13,115799958,Arya,Beautiful space and very close to everything you need. Walking distance from coffee food bars BART etc. The perfect cozy home base for a trip to the bay.
7949668,265345057,2018-05-16,49022177,Jenn,Rania was a wonderful host she is so sweet and responds to messages quickly. She has a beautiful home her place is very clean and comfortable.  Parking across the street is very convenient mini fridge in the room is a great bonus. She provided clean towels and linens as well which was great. Shared bathroom with the room across the hall but never posed a problem always clean and felt private. 10 min from AT&T park (Giants Stadium) 30 min from Golden Gate Bridge and main city attractions. Keep in mind there are lots of steep hills in the neighborhood and lots of stairs to house and upstairs room. I would recommend staying in Rania's place if you are looking for a pleasant home away from home that is away from the city. We were very happy to have a great first airbnb experience and would stay with Rania again if we ever return to San Francisco.
259622,56679331,2015-12-16,35167783,Luke,Good spot nice people. Definitely should try it out
4617719,290104248,2018-07-13,11179350,Kelley,Garland is a wonderful host. He has so many resources ready for you and your next adventure in San Francisco. The place was very clean close to public transportation and it included a completely functional kitchen. We really enjoyed our stay.
3720392,48892025,2015-09-29,6103272,Nadine,"We (a young couple) had a great time in the orange studio in SF. It was  clean big and very cosy. And it has everything you need. Kelly was not there but she gave us a lot of tipps and was very helpful. The trainstation is just a few minutes from the apartment and you need 20/30 min to get to the city center. In the neighbourhood there are many good restaurants bars supermarkets and banks and basically everything you need.
We were very very satisfied with the apartment. Kelly thank you again :)"
3319447,214119872,2017-11-24,122743658,Morris,Anna's place has a great location. Anna is a very responsive and helpful host. We stayed 8 days and wished there were a little more room for cooking and eating in the apartment which started feeling cramped after a week. But there are many great places to eat nearby. There is a great supply of books and some DVDs.
5174935,341781867,2018-10-27,10016986,Arjo,"We booked Sharon’s apartment for a one week city trip to San Francisco and some family visits in Silicon Valley.

The apartment was exactly what we have hoped for clean good cooking facilities and not to forget complementary coffee :-)

More importantly the place was a nice and peaceful retreat from the city and only a short trip away from both downtown San Francisco and the expressways to the south. 

I’m a runner.. With the beach only four blocks and Golden Gate Park only 2 miles away I even managed to squeeze two wonderful runs into our busy schedule!

I would recommend a visit to the SF Zoo.. it’s 10minutes away and small but quite unique in its kind.

Sharon was a friendly host and responded to inquiries quickly. Great value; I would definitely recommend!"
11241173,157835104,2017-06-04,28198263,Sakshi,Niya's place was perfect for my mom and I - not only is there a private room and bathroom (which is already great at that price point) but since Niya is at work during the day it really feels like you have the privacy of the whole home. Niya has a comfortable and clean home with a beautiful backyard garden and her home is walking distance from many restaurants on 24th and Mission. While it would have been nice to be closer to convenience stores or grocery stores we can't complain because our stay at Niya's was perfect.
8005452,75477441,2016-05-21,42736692,Jane,Great place to stay! Neat clean and tidy as depicted in the pictures. Really close to 24th Street and walking distance to the BART and Valencia Street. Dealing with Eugene was seamless. I would highly recommend this place! 
12953897,508387060,2019-08-12,40878951,Melissa,Beautiful stay for a family of 4.
9075976,172401323,2017-07-20,5079384,Luda,We had really good time at your house !
4614763,198831498,2017-09-30,10382635,Luz,Del’s place is super cute and just as described in the posting and seen in the photos. The apartment was comfortable and communication with her was excellent. I would stay here again. Thanks Del.
7902889,102639271,2016-09-18,10493150,Armando,The experience with Michael was incredible the location of the Airbnb is perfect to walk to everywhere almost its very quiet and very safety to walk the house it's perfect for a turist trip I'll always recommend to stay with Michael he told me about local places to have breakfast lunch and dinner and everything was perfect thank you Michael! 
4902855,410809845,2019-02-10,13907409,Kathryn,The location is sketchy but the place is clean easy communication.
29627104,553676756,2019-10-24,48681307,Todd,Great stay!  Wonderful host!
929468,9756494,2014-01-08,5352187,Kris,We loved staying at John's place.  The bathroom is so spacious and luxurious.  Our sustainability guilt would not let us use all the jets at one time but simply having a choice of which shower nozzle to choose and being in such a huge shower was sheer luxury.  Also the kitchen is perfectly equipped with everything you could possibly need and is such a high end kitchen.  Our youngest loved the under-the-stairs bed and that mattress was particularly comfortable.  The location of the loft is great and the neighborhood so charming.  Sometimes finding a parking spot was a bit challenging but there is no permit required even though it is a very residential area.  John is a very attentive host and his attention to detail in the instructions for the loft were very much appreciated.  Finally the water is the best we've ever tasted and apparently comes directly from a reservoir in Yosemite.  We look forward to returning!  
4439461,170485304,2017-07-15,12698392,Sabine,Great design throughout the apartment plus perfect location!! Great experience with no head ache :)
1033754,28780994,2015-03-30,23672445,Chris,We had a perfect stay at Jennifer and Eric's house. Clean and spacious with a great location. Jennifer was very friendly communicative and had a binder waiting on the kitchen table with every detail we needed. Would definitely stay again!
37946020,558234163,2019-11-02,208053572,Marissa,10 MILLION STAAAAAAAAAARS!!!! I booked this place for my five day honeymoon and it was extremely amazing. Comfortable. Beautiful. Full kitchen. 1.5 bath. Like this place is literally my dream home. Honestly the only “complaint” I have is parking but that’s not the hosts fault but the city’s. You’ll want to walk to everything because it’s easier and just classic gorgeous San Francisco. Lyft/Uber is a great option and public transportation is a good price too. LOVE THIS PLACE SOOOO MUCH! Worth every single cent.
4252808,233034857,2018-02-07,164884947,Diane,Great place with a lovely private garden patio and nice artful touches throughout. A nice quite place to relax but not too much to do in the immediate neighborhood in the way of dining or entertainment.  But a wide ocean beach is right across the road and is great for walks and sunsets.
30512322,439828087,2019-04-19,41423826,Nelly,Great host! Thank you
748222,499574593,2019-07-31,35216653,Katherine,Michael and Yesica's place was very beautiful and comfortable. Even though I couldn't meet the host everything was organize and ready for my stay. Thank you Michael and yesica!
12953897,174112443,2017-07-24,48800022,Fer,The house is lovely and Robyn was a great host! We felt really welcomed. 
29906297,431398654,2019-03-31,47941834,Emanuel,Initially there hospitality was good but slowly degraded with time it is a sublet roomto help curve there rentprivacy was an issue I've definitely had better experience with air bnb by the end of my stay it was quite uncomfortable and I couldnt wait to leave.
1615088,166881125,2017-07-04,25912927,Alicia,Jack and Jason's home is on a quiet street very close to a lively walkable neighborhood with awesome restaurants near Alamo Square in San Francisco. Our room was perfect with comfortable beds and a large bathroom. It was well equipped and very clean upon arrival. We could not have asked for more in our stay in San Francisco!

Lots of thoughtful touches like free sun cream in the lobby and activities and every night. The room was warm and quiet and there were plenty of showers and restrooms for all guests to use.

Pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff. Would definitely come back."

It is a perfect haven at the end of a busy day!
We stayed for six weeks and enjoyed every moment. The apartment is cozy and spotlessly clean. It is well equipped with everything you need for your stay. The apartment is in a quiet residential streetbut a few hundred yards in either direction brings you to shops restaurants and the excellent public transport system. We didn't hire a car as there was no need. We travelled everywhere by bus and train using the maps thoughtfully provided in the apartment. 
 Charlesie and Tedd are excellent hosts nothing is too much trouble......... From the delicious scones as part of a 'welcome' pack to their advice and recommendation throughout our stay. They were friendly and welcoming and always available to answer questions and make recommendations. We feel we've made two new friends!!
There is so much to see and do in San Francisco we could have stayed another six weeks and still not have seen it all.
Thank you Charlesie and Tedd for helping to make our stay so comfortable and enjoyable!!

8102262,148390836,2017-04-30,117330952,Tavia,The hospitality shown to us was amazing.  The view was amazing with great restaurants within walking distance. Definitely a place to stay if you want to be close to the city but want some quiet at night. We will definitely stay again. 
1569288,53344345,2015-11-08,44603651,Lauren,I recently spent a week in this appartment and had a wonderful experience. The location was perfect. I was visiting the UCSF Parnassus campus for work which was just a short walk away. It was also located near multiple delicious restaurants and right across the stree from Golden Gate park. Mini was very accomodating. She allowed me to check in early and check out late to work with my flight schedule. I would definitely stay here again. 
24916302,299830205,2018-07-31,191594159,Alejandro,Excellent host really enhanced our stay in San Francisco and the experience was definitely improved by the beautiful home and it's amenities.

958,338517713,2018-10-19,3413267,Rebecca,Holly's place was perfect for me! Lovely spacious with lots of light despite being on the ground floor. Huge doors open to a cute backyard. Holly came down to introduce herself when I checked in and was sweet enough to bring a fan down to me for white noise for sleeping :)  The neighborhood is GREAT - right in the middle of the city and you can easily walk or uber to all sorts of great restaurants Twin Peaks etc. The place was clean and the bed was comfy and there was a french press and ground coffee....loved it!  Sometimes you could hear people walking around upstairs but it was never too disturbing. Overall I loved it and would absolutely stay there again.
1633933,10012291,2014-01-25,11276726,Matthew,Beautiful home fantastic location friendly and attentive host drama-free experience. If you are a runner this is an unbeatable location for getting AM exercise into your day literally steps from Golden Gate Park.
11939561,254950996,2018-04-18,60413663,Barb,We enjoyed a wonderful  stay at Tiffany’s. The lovely shower comfortable bed and kitchenette were greatly appreciated. We used BART MUNI and Uber with ease. Exploring the Mission was enjoyable and our meals were outstanding.

Pour une petite famille Suisse Romande c'était amusant de se retrouver à la Swiss Street dans la maison Swiss. 
Charmant appartement décoré avec goût dans un quartier calme où 4 personnes peuvent aisément séjourner. La cuisine est très bien équipée les 2 chambres sont confortables la salle de bain est moderne et notre endroit préféré au salon: la banquette près de la fenêtre. 
Accueil sympathique de Stephen qui on le sent aime son quartier et nous a accompagné pour nous montrer le ""village"". Supermarché restaurants boulangerie fromagerie tout se trouve à quelques pas y compris la station de métro (BART). 
Stephen a même pensé à fournir de quoi prendre notre premier petit déjeuné tranquillement sans s'inquiéter de faire des courses (café fromage beurre lait toasts et vodka :-)).
Tout se que voulez savoir sur SF Stephen le connait et pourra vous conseiller sans problèmes. 
Merci Stephen pour cet accueil et si un jour on repasse par SF ce sera assurément par la Maison Swiss!

C’était un plaisir de les rencontrer afin de découvrir cette belle ville de San Francisco. L’appartement lui est fonctionnel et proche du Muni pour rejoindre le centre facilement. Egalement à deux pas du Golden Gate Park. Instructions parfaitement claires.
Ils ont tout bon !
Merci à eux encore une fois !"

13606695,120092407,2016-12-07,22126365,Deana,The location is perfect.... its less then a mile to my office which is great while i am staying in SF for business... the bed was super comfy I love the privacy especially since  I am staying there because Im working 14-18 hour days. awesome shower and good local close to whole foods... I for sure will keep this as my go to when I need to stay in the city!!! thanks for having such a clean and nice spot!! and for being so accommodating. I would recommend this place to anyone!!!
2016198,304045272,2018-08-08,178276103,Matthias,It was a really nice stay in San Francisco. The room with own bathroom was great. Everything was clean. Char and Rus had a lot of snacks for us. I would recommend it to every one. 
3200431,14934487,2014-06-29,13581610,Ellen,This place was lovely. Such a central safe location. The bus to downtown was just around the corner and the golden gate park was within walking distance. We really enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend it to anyone. 
11191951,257853794,2018-04-27,56331297,Adam,Perfect place everything was fantastic.  Would definitely stay again.

286311,174686503,2017-07-26,132328844,Armando,This home was fantastic for my family which included my wife and I our two sons in college and our daughter in high school. Lots of space for us to unwind after a full day of sightseeing.  Less than two blocks away is a park (Corona Heights) with an incredible view of the city. The view is even better at night. A small beautifully landscaped backyard with built in benches different elevations  and a small deck patio has the feel of a private secluded hidden garden. We grilled out I loved it! Kitchen is well equipped with many high end features and extras. Lots of dishes and wine glasses. We were all very happy to end each long sightseeing day in Evelyn's spacious and very comfortable home where we could stretch out and relax. Her home truly is a retreat in the city!  We always felt safe walking to Corona Heights at night walking the Vulcan stairs in the dark and walking to the local liquor store at night. I would avoid the Castro city center after dark only because the night life got to be too wild for my conservative family. We never felt threatened or anything it was just that the night life is not family friendly. The Castro city center is not where a family wants to wander and shop or hang out very much so avoid that and you will thoroughly enjoy your stay at this beautiful home!
27491792,508310952,2019-08-12,67157268,Kevin,Lovely place to stay. Thanks
13585679,167166913,2017-07-05,8501546,Mark,Very convenient for anyone wanting to be in the Misson district. Many great Mexican and Central American eateries and a short walk to the 24th street BART.  Ideal for one person but can accommodate two easily.  Clean and well-appointed with everything  you might need for a short visit.
17434665,217528008,2017-12-09,146369703,Brendan,"The first thing we noticed as we entered Steve's AirBnB for the first time was that the pictures were 100% accurate. I've stayed at AirBnB's where the pictures have completely misrepresented what the AirBnB will look like. That was NOT the case this time! This AirBnB exceeded our expectations. It was stocked with towels toilet paper spices dishes washing machines dryers and more! It instantly felt like a home away from home.

I whole-heartedly recommend this place. We loved every second of it!"

487499,7005465,2013-09-03,5439108,Matt,We had a great time staying at Daniel's apartment in the heart of the Mission district.  You really could not ask for a better location if cheap or chic eats and great public transportation are tops on your list.  It's also situated close to an upscale grocery (Bi-rite) to keep you stocked on all the tasty local treats.  Daniel was very communicative and available for questions throughout the duration of our 9 day stay.  I'd highly recommend a stay at their Mission apartment.
23830079,540557043,2019-10-03,34376619,Ryan,Noelle’s place is situated in a beautiful neighbourhood close to the beach and the park so if you like to go running or for walks it’s ideal. The neighbourhood itself all though a distance from the hustle and bustle of downtown San Francisco has all of the amenities you would want like wonderful coffee shops a bakery restaurants and an amazing cinema. We enjoyed getting up in the morning having a nice breakfast without the hassle of trying to find somewhere in the city then catching the bus which is conveniently situated on the high st downtown. Likewise on the night it was nice to have somewhere to retreat to away from  downtown for a meal drinks etc. Noelle’s place itself is easy to find and has been tastefully converted from the adjoining houses garage. It has all the modern conveniences that you would require  like a smart tv fridge fans a lovely shower and toiletries are supplied. I also found it to have adequate space  for our needs. The studio is bellow where Noelle and her family live so do expect to hear some noise from them coming and going but this wasn’t an issue for us (I’m a light sleeper and I was never disturbed) and Noelle had taken this into account and provided a device to help cancel any noise. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would very much recommend Noelle’s place to anybody.
1460628,284643090,2018-07-01,81300952,Van,It’s not actually an entire apt/house it’s a basement.

23946104,465998960,2019-06-08,61507054,Pauline,Notre séjour chez Maria était au-delà de nos éspérences. Studio aménagé avec salle de bain privative et cuisine privative. Très spacieux lit confortable et surtout très propre ! Plutôt bien situé dans la ville. Toutes les instructions d'arrivée sont données à l'avance donc aucun soucis à ce niveau là. Nous avons passé un super séjour à San Francisco ! Nous recommandons vivement !!

213532,4412746,2013-05-03,3047633,Beth,I am posting my reply kind of late but that is just due to my busy schedule - I loved staying at Josh's!! The rooms were absolutely beautiful! The location is great; there are numerous restaurants sites cafe's grocery stores etc... all in walking distance - and it is right near Golden Gate Park. Josh was great!! Very accommodating and gracious - I have a fracture in my foot and he very nicely helped me with my bags (which were numerous). I definitely recommend for anyone visiting San Francisco.

The house is located at a sweet spot: quiet but with Castro and Valencia a couple of blocks away. The house itself is quite old/student-like though very spacious and the room is well taken care off.
If you have any questions be it where to eat or find a hardware store Ethan will point you in the right direction!"
11674758,317182631,2018-09-01,187370367,David,Great location.  Seemed a bit more like a private room at a hostel with shared bathroom and kitchen area.  No public living room area.

1206233,20188151,2014-09-25,11352553,Coralie,Un emplacement central dans le haight ashbury des lignes de bus rejoignant la plupart des points d'intérêts. Chambre 5 un peu petite et ne bénéficiant pas du confort des autres chambres. Mal isolé on entends bien les conversations des chambres voisines (6 chambres en tout sur le même étage). La chambre 5 communique sur les deux chambres à gauche et droite : d'un côté par une double porte condamné mais qui offre une médiocre isolation de l'autre par un accès commun au placard/lavabo... Le Wifi ne fonctionnait pas. Pas de cafetière ni de table dans la cuisine ce qui rend un peu compliqué les repas sur place puisqu'il n'y a pas de table non plus dans la chambre 5. Un endroit à recommander pour son emplacement et les autres chambres sans doute...
32087546,429713456,2019-03-28,8468156,Bhaskar,This Is my second stay in this month at Guang’s place. It is my home away from home. He is eager to help you checkin and settle into your room. Always prompt and courteous. Place is very conveniently located and I am happy to recommend this place to anyone visiting The City!
1815551,145552530,2017-04-18,648346,Greg,This was a wonderful location in a quiet scenic beautiful residential neighborhood that is walkable to some of the best spots in The Mission and Noe Valley.
166771,91552675,2016-08-05,52704204,Kathleen,We were very impressed with Patti's place in San Francisco.  The place is so cute and well taken care of. It had a well appointed kitchen with everything you could ever need.  The living room and bedroom were very comfortable.  We loved the bright and cheerful sun room.  The location was perfect near markets on Haight Street and near transit to get to other parts of the city. We have nothing but great things to say about Patti and the apartment.
6326133,331810008,2018-10-03,180590893,Petrea,Maureen's place was great.  Close to many great sites in the city without the hustle of being downtown.  We loved it because it was a great location.  The rooms were great and Maureen's hospitality was exceptional.  Would definitely recommend Maureen's to friends and cannot wait to come back.
918341,7813396,2013-10-04,3741663,Kevin,Another flawless stay my fourth at one of Kepa's properties while in SF for work. Highly recommended; the only drawback is that the word about this excellent host seems to have gotten out so you'll have to book pretty far in advance!
3718865,325808898,2018-09-20,213421523,Mike,"Fantastic place to stay while in San Francisco.  Bus routes had us downtown fairly quickly. Also used Uber a couple times for short trips. Katie's home was extremely comfortable and I will always go for a non shared Airbnb space  this was a whole suite!!!! 

Highly suggest everyone stays here"
7020637,224313544,2018-01-02,156960896,Emiley,My friends and I had a fantastic stay at Birgit’s place! We didn’t get to meet her as she was out of town but she was always very responsive and helpful when we needed something. The place is cute and has everything you need. She has one of the best cats ever which was a nice bonus to have around. Best of all the location is amazing right in the Mission with tons of bars and restaurants within walking distance. I’d definitely recommend Birgit’s place for anyone looking for a fun stay in San Francisco!
22016476,313634177,2018-08-25,82175673,Aaron,Stayed here for the summer for an internship (10 weeks). Very good location for access to public transportation. Just know what you’re getting yourself into when you move to the mission. Never had any trouble myself during the stay. Great restaurants in walking distance. Overall the space was small but manageable. I wouldn’t stay here with more than 2 people. 
631635,6460130,2013-08-13,6824909,Andi,Betty's place was way better than we expected and we loved staying there. The view from the living room window was incredible and wonderfully relaxing. The art choices throughout the flat made us smile. Yes the hill was steep but that's San Francisco. Plus the healthy walk was needed after visiting San Francisco's wonderful restaurants and getting dessert at Hot Cookie. We would recommend the flat to anyone.

5117701,91591330,2016-08-06,69919210,Elaine,I enjoyed staying in Stefan's apartment as it was very well-furbished. Stefan is a great host who always checked on our needs and went all lengths to assist us when we had queries. It is a cozy place enough for 4 lean adults to fit in. To add on the location is very convenient to places of attraction. Highly recommended~! Thank you Stefan for everything.

51374,2762843,2012-10-30,3763621,Andy,Tom was fantastic to deal with and would recommend both him as a host and his apartment to anyone. He was flexible well prepared and had thought through everything someone may need while staying there. The apartment is located near an adorable neighborhood just outside the downtown core of SF with grocery store restaurants and public transportation all close by. I would definitely reach out to Tom again if I ever have more guests in town that need a place to stay! Great experience overall.

4287481,503891821,2019-08-06,11890479,Tess,"We had a lovely stay at Rumesha’s apartment. Bali was welcoming and gave us a full tour of the apartment. It comfortably fitted us 3 adults. Beddings and towels were well stocked and she also provided shampoo shower gel as well as stocking the fridge with milk and orange juice. 
The location is in a quiet and safe area close to many asian restaurants and supermarket. It’s also not too far from Golden Gate park.
We did expect a full kitchen but managed with the single portable stove provided.  
Having a car park spot was very convenient too with easy access to the apartment through the garage.
Thank you Rumesha & Bali for being super hosts and providing us a clean and enjoyable stay in your apartment."
8472927,267775950,2018-05-22,168633375,Christie,Beautiful home with private space and entrance in a quiet residential area. Such a nice escape after a busy day in the city.  We easily used lyft to get to tourist areas and enjoyed coming back to a peaceful house. Comfortable bed and thoughtful beverages and snacks left by the hosts as well as information on the city.  Very welcoming. We truly enjoyed our stay!

4359078,358833180,2018-12-15,160210137,Stefanie,Für San Francisco günstige Unterkunft in Top-Lage in einer netten Gegend. Die Zimmer sind geräumig und sauber. Besonders praktisch ist dass Parken sowie Frühstück im Preis inkludiert sind.
28764476,540019910,2019-10-02,1135093,Deepa,Great location great building amenities sparkling clean apartment.
499096,2030518,2012-08-19,381351,Iris,"Ingrid's place is perfect if you're looking for a place to sleep and from where you can easily visit San Francisco. The studio is very small but it has everything you need: a futon that is comfortable a worktable with a tv on it wireless internet a very small kitchen with a small fridge and a microwave (no oven or sink so it is not a place to cook a diner) and a small bathroom with a shower and a lavabo. There's even a electric heat when the nights get too cold (the studio is on the ground floor so it's a little bit cold in there). The studio is located behind a house so you have to get pass a gate and a small but lovely garden to access it. There's an apartment above so you may hear the people living there thought they weren't there til the last day we stayed there so it wasn't a big deal at all.
The location itself is the best thing about this studio. It is in the heart of Mission District a very cool area of SF. It is a few steps away from the Dolores Park the Valencia and Mission streets and a lot of cool cafes and restaurants. The line J of the minibus is a 5 min-walk and it goes directly to the downtown.
Ingrid and is daughter Anna (who took care of us because Ingrid was in Europe) were very easy to deal with. Anna left us the keys in the mailbox and a few helpful recommandations in a letter.

7348398,297982206,2018-07-28,192178289,Melanie,Oh my goodness this place was a dream. I'm pretty shy and was nervous to stay in someone's house while they were there but Mike and Joann could not have been nicer. They instantly made me and my boyfriend feel comfortable. They gave us helpful advice throughout our whole trip. The location and room were perfect! I had a hard time leaving the beautiful fog room. Cannot recommend this place enough :)
3205059,26444996,2015-02-13,23105244,Mark,Beautiful and clean apartment and the location is very handy about 15-20 minutes walk into the city. Vera was very welcoming and was always there for any questions I may have had. Would definitely recommend this listing!
10088395,76589953,2016-05-28,70505611,Nicholas,Stephen was an excellent host. He was very friendly accommodating and provided great information about the neighborhood. His penthouse is in a perfect location with many walkable restaurants parks and entertainment. It is also very centrally located making travel to other more distant destinations very easy. I would gladly stay with Stephen again in the future!

13239943,324718064,2018-09-17,178642904,Fiona,This is a great place to stay. The rooms are comfortable with nice linen and towels. It’s very central with lots of restaurants just along Union Street (across Van Ness) and a fab place for a healthy breakfast called Toasty (on Octavia street) - although they offer a basic continental style breakfast at the motel. It’s not the quietest place to stay but that’s understandable in a motel. Get a 3-day bus ticket in the hardware store a block away on the corner of Poke and Green streets and enjoy the city’s transport - the hills are mega if on foot!!! Pacific Heights is highly recommended.
13978938,338908546,2018-10-20,75303779,Geoff,The 2 bed suite is an excellent room. Spacious very clean nicely furnished. The location was an excellent convenient base for exploring SF.
13591271,106818622,2016-10-08,84570915,Tim,I never met Art but there was no need as his communication was superb. He was very quick to reply to any questions I had. The check in process was also so easy it was untrue. The place was as advertised and I have no complaints whatsoever. Lots of privacy with a big spacious room including a living area with sofa and cable TV. It is also very conveniently located in a quiet neighbourhood which is 5 mins walk to Balboa Park station which is then a short ride to downtown as well as a convenient location to get to SFO.
47486,439645,2011-08-12,67696,Heidi,Rick is great!  I really enjoyed staying in the cottage and would definitely stay with Rick and Suz again.   The cottage was very comfortable and it was nice having somewhere cozy to come home to!  Highly recommended! 
648086,298848929,2018-07-29,7004031,Sophie,Ponge was a great host! A very hospitable host with some local tips. The room and bathroom itself was very clean and private. I would definitely recommend staying at Ponge's place!!

Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until 3am in which our beds were ready with spare towels and tooth brushes - feeling very welcomed. Her apartment is stunning so cosy and lovely! Above all she gave us so much advice on where to go and what to do around the area- including restaurants and sightseeing. Also a 10min walk to the nearest Bart train station which is about 5mins away from Union Square. So easy! Highly recommend to stay here!!
17159806,254137944,2018-04-15,39926168,Hunter,Such a great location! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

11191951,199996401,2017-10-03,141696501,Victoria,This was our first experience with an AirBnB and we were pleasantly surprised.  Matt and Jeff's communication with us was awesome.  They were there if we needed them for anything.  The bed was very comfortable and we loved the views of the bay outside the windows.  Matt and Jeff thought of every detail to make our experience wonderful.  The room was nicely stocked with some breakfast items bottled beverages a Keurig Coffee maker and many other amenities that made us feel at home.  The bathroom was even well stocked with items that are sometimes forgotten.  I even saw a first aid kit in the closet and thankfully we did not need it.  The room and location is very beautiful and this all made for a wonderful first time experience through AirBnB.

The place is immaculately clean located in a quiet neighborhood and the backyard even includes a hammock! Love the keypad system; makes everything so convenient. 

Gustav was extremely responsive to communication and even though he wasn't home during most of our stay he came back right before we left and allowed us to use his kitchen to cook food. He also recommended a few awesome off the beaten path spots to check out. 

I highly recommend Gustav and his lovely garden apartment. I'd definitely stay here again if I were back in the area! "

348714,66893359,2016-03-25,49575183,Sarah,George's place was wonderful - very quiet and clean. I booked this place for my parents to stay while they were in San Francisco visiting me and they were delighted with the space and location. They really enjoyed the private back patio of George's apartment where they could sip coffee in the morning and relax after long days out. George is an attentive host and was quick to message me back before and during the trip and is only a floor away if we needed something. I would certainly recommend this property to anyone looking to enjoy the Nopa area of SF. This area has a lot of character and is just a short walk from Golden Gate park Haight/Ashbury and bus lines that get you all over the city. 
8524982,249779374,2018-04-02,438812,William,A lovely flat with a beautiful roof terrace. The location is fabulous and Shane was very helpful.

24376665,460260512,2019-05-28,27623856,Nitinun,Ching Ho place locates in a very nice neighbor (SF could easily be sketchy if you turn to a wrong block). There are yummy and pretty cheap Asian restaurants around the area. The host is very nice and quickly responded when I asked about a nearby place to buy an extra luggage. Be mindful that there is no elevator and if you travel with big luggages it might be very convenience. Overall we really enjoy the place and would recommend!
36054521,571885071,2019-12-01,45410609,Jennifer,My parents stayed here for a month while visiting SF. Location is fantastic and building is quiet and well kept. The unit is clean and has good storage. Gaisar was a very responsive host who took care of them. Bathroom is a little dated but otherwise functional. Would recommend this place for anyone who wants to stay in this part of town.
13464987,311231092,2018-08-20,59438571,Yannick,"Eventhough the location was great we were disappointed overall. Maybe we should have read between the lines when the description said that the kitchen was ""not set up"" for ""cooking large meals"" ... Yet even when we brought take-away food to microwave or took too long in the kitchen it was a problem. One morning our host came in and the first thing she said was that my friend and I sure liked to cook
a lot yet I was simply having breakfast and not cooking and our host added that the actual problem was using the kitchen space. We did not know there would be a roommate to share it with. 
We did not like being yelled at because we unintentionally left the kitchen window only partiallly open. 
The bed was too small for two adults. 
We paid a lot of money and we felt it was not worth it."
17478285,262733687,2018-05-10,6192734,Yu-Shih,Very helpful host
11345707,85490594,2016-07-11,23414821,Sara,Michael was a wonderfully attentive and appropriately concerned host. He left snacks and a stocked fridge--such nice touches for people touring the town all day. We were unfamiliar with the neighborhood but loved the proximity to the BART and range of cute shops and restaurants. We even felt safe walking around at night. And the cottage made us feel like we had our very own tiny house! One word of caution: the futon bed while very comfortable was smaller than a full-sized bed so it may not work for two large adults. 
33578,312067253,2018-08-22,2617429,Jasmine,Kepa’s place is incredibly quiet clean and peaceful. Kepa is available for whatever you need and her place is near to many great eateries. She’s got everything you need including ironing board TV blow dryer and little mini fridge for all your leftovers! Recommend staying in this little oasis :-)
9464763,341363153,2018-10-26,122717544,Stephen,This is a great place to stay in close proximity to Fisherman’s Wharf and to see San Francisco. The place is beautiful but be mindful that you will need to walk up two flights of stairs to get to the condo. Pete is a wonderful host and has a beautiful home! It’s worth the investment.
16043093,531538187,2019-09-17,220981285,Stefan,Perfect for two average for more than two
17420087,260130396,2018-05-03,124437712,Jose,Hiromi is really thoughtful and helpful the best host you can find. The place is clean and really worths the value totally recommended!

727866,508327519,2019-08-12,15428305,Beat,Das Studio können wir absolut empfehlen top ausgerüstet heimelig und ohne Strassenlärm. Wir waren 14 Tage dort. Esther und Kevin sind zwei grossartige Gastgeber. In der Nähe: nur 5 Gehminuten zum grossen und eindrücklichen Strand Surfergegend. Java Café und Restaurant Outerlands an der Judah Street sehr zu empfehlen. Shoppingcenter Stonestown sehr schön. Golden Gate Park Twin Peaks Haight Ashbury sehr nahe. Ca. 20 Min. mit Auto im Down Town. Ca. 35 Min. zum Pier 39. Ca. 15 Min. zur Golden Gate Bridge. Parkhäuser sehr günstig als Early Bird d.h. Ankunft bis 9am.
1487849,29296413,2015-04-06,19863826,Katherine,Maury was both communicative and accommodating. The place was cozy for 4 people and made for an enjoyable stay with our friends. I can see why Maury loves the neighbourhood - it is wonderful and still within walking distance of the Mission. 
18754189,547711775,2019-10-15,83569209,Jan,This place is a perfect location for sightseeing in San Francisco.  Its only 20 minutes from all the main viewpoints.  The apartment has all the basics you need.  Parking can be difficult to find in the later evening.  Barbara gave us the driveway the first evening.
13127954,192655885,2017-09-10,12616727,Darragh,Perfect place to stay for a new days in San Francisco. A fairly quite neighborhood still within walking distance to some nice bars and restaurants. The apartment is lovely and finished to a very high standard.
1470340,197534333,2017-09-25,133872421,Wendy,Lovely hosts we enjoyed our stay here. Nice wine and supplies in fridge appreciated. Walked to store nearby. Half hour uber to town/Fishermans wharf.
9497588,139311060,2017-03-24,38440730,Miranda,Great location in North Beach walkable to the Wharf bike rental discount and airport shuttle available. They had everything I needed and the place was clean and many bathrooms to share although all rooms are private which is not something I expect with a hostel. Would def stay again
26533564,523051862,2019-09-02,11285637,Samuel,"The apartment was well located a short walk to Haight street. However it’s next to major road so was quite noisy. The room itself was clean and the bed was large and comfy.

Dan didn’t interact with us much while we were there or give us a rundown of the apartment. As a result we didn’t feel entirely welcome in the apartment. At a minimum I’d recommend he explain how the shower works as it wasn’t obvious to us. He did give us a guide to the area which was really helpful.

Finally people were smoking a lot downstairs on the final night with the smoke coming into our room. It would have been good to know about the smoking inside before we booked."
2956406,34203432,2015-06-06,24343536,Kevin,Friendly and fantastic host in a clean room  in a great location in San Francisco. We really enjoyed staying with Simon and completely recommend him.
3029597,230035588,2018-01-26,25950024,Maggy,Alison and Mark’s place is wonderful- beside some amazing restaurants which I tried out for dinner on the way back each evening. It’s a short distance to financial district for work and an even shorter distance to the main tourist spots! Very comfortable and incredibly kind hosts!
27486947,427033790,2019-03-22,54982401,Allen,Clean surprisingly spacious and 24hr front desk support.
34785227,480023777,2019-07-01,105155950,Aliana,"Simply amazing!

Stunning views spacious and clean rooms easy to communicate with. An overall great experience! I'd highly recommend."
1827177,212425885,2017-11-17,157778650,Anton,A fantastic place to stay while visiting San Francisco. It's hospitable and so close to everything.
12175415,69038087,2016-04-08,17624095,Mc,We absolutely loved our stay at Deb's beautiful modern yet comfortable and pristine apartment. We arrived late at night after a very lomg flight to find bottled water and wonderful snacks. The aprtment had all the amenities including big TV  that we needed. In the morning we had delicious coffee and then wandered on Clement Street enjoying great shops bookstores and had a great lunch at B star. Everything is in walking distance of this great apartment. Deb made great recommendations and was so helpful. It was nice to get back to our oasis to relax before going out to dinner. We are thrilled to have found this brand new gem in this spectacular location. We had a private entrance which really made it feel extra special. We cant say enough about the apartment the location and our great host!
2677288,19354103,2014-09-10,5212041,Damien,Guy is so friendly. Room was clean and aesthetic. Shower water pressure was fantastic. Location great.
18286171,235187819,2018-02-15,169407463,Yang,位置很好的地方离海和公园都不远社区安全停车方便｡房间设施很新床很舒服客厅布置很好｡入住方便快捷｡房东先生很热情还送了我们小礼物｡有家的感觉｡希望还有机会入住｡
70753,12871481,2014-05-12,15249347,Vahe,"It's very well organized everybody is friendly. I rented a bicycle and felt safe leaving it (locked of course) on stairs. It occupies at least top floors of small building which is really close to everything and easy to find. 
I thought it would be good experience to stay for a day but I actually think it's better for those who stay longer and also for those who are international travelers and such. which is good. (but I was thinking I want to stay longer while drinking hot coffee which I didn't make myself and exactly what I needed in morning)
so if you are on car from USA need to stay 1-2 days it won't be bad but probably you would find other place anyways. for any other cases you will have nice experience."
5852066,145290255,2017-04-17,19573075,Michael & Anna,This character Victorian suite boasts a convenient location as well as a cozy and incredibly clean place to lay your head at night. A block away from Alamo Square Park and the infamous 'Painted Ladies'...the views of the city are amazing. Paul provides you with quick replies and promptly answers questions you may have. A VERY enjoyable experience!
26566885,405862808,2019-01-27,61933061,Rachel,It is in a convenient location!
3112427,455590304,2019-05-19,64118151,Rebecca,Great place!
14990478,336040191,2018-10-13,171773866,Robert,Great place to stay near to the BART and local shops Cozy Cottage has everything a guest would need.
1769688,220095923,2017-12-20,18459384,Katy,Robs place is not only central to many of the San Francisco spots but it is clean naturally lit spacious and homey. Not to mention there is a table of helpful pamphlets in his hall and a map of nearby spots. Rob goes above and beyond with these touches as well as leaving shampoo conditioner and towels for your use and offers snacks tea and coffee for your consumption. Would recommend him and his place to anyone!
728585,8442472,2013-10-31,8087913,Anita,Just spent a week at the Clipper Cottage and it was wonderful.  Comfy bed lovely back yard friendly dog to greet you upon your arrival and very easy to walk to all the great stores and restaurants on 24th Street.  Will definitely stay here again.  Anita and Thom
562311,49861486,2015-10-06,101069,Joe,Angie was a great host. Her place is comfortable and the location is ideal. I would definitely want to stay at Angie's again the next time I'm in San Francisco.
6326133,69837966,2016-04-14,30640986,Monique,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
18904,9926532,2014-01-20,4819377,Lillian,Delightful place in San Francisco.  the bedroom is immaculate and the apartment is beautiful furnished and decorated.  Patrick is a gracious host always smiling while giving you good information about the city.  I attended a workshop a few blocks away and walking in this quiet neighborhood was very pleasant and nice experience.
27735398,343786754,2018-11-01,119730560,Lola,Apartamento perfecto en relación calidad-precio. En nuestro caso no vimos a Juli pero contestó a todas nuestras dudas. No es céntrico pero se encuentra bien conectado via autobus. Sin duda repetiriamos!
14142409,103860383,2016-09-24,80900959,Danna,Host was friendly.
21766603,430042492,2019-03-29,2810325,Christopher,Great place. Very good snacks nice touch. Particularly enjoyed the shower. Very comfortable. Can check all the boxes for this place. Would recommend and definitely would stay again.
3309722,27645551,2015-03-09,17888947,Evelyn,"My boyfriend and I flew up to SF from LA for a little down time and a workshop that was held down the street.  We feel so lucky to have found such a gem!  The view was beautiful the room was very clean the neighborhood was perfect and Cliff was so sweet and accommodating.  I also appreciated all the little thoughtful touches/amenities throughout the studio.  

This was our first AirBNB experience and I'm happy to report that it couldn't have been any better.  They really went above and beyond and I would recommend this listing to anyone visiting this fabulous city!  We'll be back.  

Thanks again and again Cliff and Colleen. "
6423158,140405753,2017-03-29,90593881,Björn,Good apartment to be based in SF
4191242,83473751,2016-07-03,67991287,Kimberly,We had no problem finding the key to the apartment. A bottle of wine and some chocolates awaited us in the kitchen as well as some written information about the tourist attractions and neibourhood highlights. The apartment was exactly as in the photos even the amazing views (which I had expected to have been an exaggeration).  The apartment was very clean the beds were comfortable and there were plenty of extra blankets for five adults. I had been told that dining in San Francisco would be very costly but we had no problem finding affordable dining nearby with the help of a few internet searches.  We walked from the apartment to Union Square as well as to Pier 39 but there is plenty of public transportation nearby.  The only negative that I can think of is that the apartment is at the very top of a dead-end street. Cars were parked on both sides making it quite narrow. We double-parked to unload our suicases. Luckily we returned our car rental the day that we arrived. Public parking around the apartment is $30.00US per day. If we ever return to San Francisco I would not hesitate to return to this apartment. Veronica and Leo certainly made sure that nothing was missing.
12835527,143205138,2017-04-10,80877583,Molly,"We loved staying at Traci's place! Bernal Heights is great - it's nice to come home to a quiet neighborhood after exploring the city all day. And there are nice places a few blocks away for breakfast or a late night drink and a nice grocery store too. It's easy to get to public transportation from Traci's place. It's also pretty easy to find street parking compared to the rest of the city. And don't miss out on the view from the top of the hill at Bernal Heights Park!

Traci was a friendly host and gave us great suggestions on places to visit. And we loved her popcorn! She was great with communication from start to finish. The place is clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable trip. Traci provided shampoo body wash a blow dryer and towels in the bathroom. The kitchen was well-stocked with appliances you'd need to cook as well as a coffee maker with coffee provided. 

We had a great time in San Francisco and if we are ever back in town again we'd happily stay with Traci!"
4175303,249736519,2018-04-02,27380684,Liz,Stuart and Amanda have a cozy home in a great location. We loved our stay!
3433930,67261876,2016-03-27,63007528,Cherie,I loved staying at Paul and Tom's home.  They made me feel like a welcome guest.  The room was comfortable with an incredible view of the city.  I was afraid of driving and was pleased to find that it was an easy walk to a Safeway Walgreens restaurants and parks.  The house was very clean and quiet and the bed so comfortable I slept like a rock. It was  nice to wake up in the morning and make coffee with the  set up in my bathroom. I slipped on a walk and got muddy and they graciously let me wash clothes. The neighborhood was lovely and I enjoyed sitting in my room watching people on the top of Twin Peaks.  I will definitely stay here the next time I'm back in San Francisco.
31616885,472921517,2019-06-20,254429816,Fatima,It’s an amazing place and Anna is always pending on our necessities and answer any question no complaints at all had a wonderful time she’s always there when you need it
7086626,62167455,2016-02-12,34318101,A J,The room was as advertised!  Clean and comfy.  Very homely!   I appreciate the little conveniences a mini-fridge water boiler wifi and privacy!   Everything was clean!  Also the location is good.  Near amenities.  No shortage of food choices.  Host made some good recommendations on food.   Definitely consider this place the next time I am in SF.

9051149,80023831,2016-06-15,51892364,Cinar,We loved staying at Elmer's place with him and London (the Corgi). The place is beautifully presented in a great location and so easy to get around. It was a pleasure staying there and we would definitely stay there next time we're in San Francisco!
13127954,179557962,2017-08-07,60849429,Bonnie,We stayed in the India room which had beautiful light pouring in through windows with a fantastic view.  Loved the common area and kitchen!  The area is perfect if you want to get away from downtown and tourist areas and stay in a beautiful quiet neighborhood with easy parking.  Walk to Mission and Castro.  Wonderful hosts.  Would definitely recommend and stay again.  Thank you!
16178751,141341053,2017-04-02,7208285,Nathaniel,Andrew's place is wonderful. Spent a weekend here and the location plus amenities can't be beat. Need to go to the Bay again just to stay here.
51773,32165212,2015-05-15,8873146,Lavanya,Jay is a fabulous host! She is such a wonderful person & I enjoyed staying in her home. She always has great insights on the neighborhood & is super fun to talk to! I'd recommend the apartment to anyone looking for a spot in Pac Heights!
6934874,114223248,2016-11-16,103581009,Anna,"Es ist eine sehr schöne große geräumige helle Wohnung.  Die Wohnung war gut ausgestattet Das Bad war sehr sauber und modern. Die küche ist mit dem Esszimmer verbunden bietet alles was man zum kochen braucht.
 Wohnung ist nah gelegen an der Golden Gate bridge und zum Supermarkt sind es nur 20 min mit dem Auto. "
32385663,506534681,2019-08-10,79199103,Konstantin,David's place is stunning! The house is well-maintained as it's clear that David puts a lot of effort into it. I rented the room for a longer period of time and I had a great stay. The common spaces (living room kitchen and balcony) were especially nice. David has always quickly responded to my messages and has been helpful with any requests I've had. The only con about this room is the sliding door which doesn't close entirely. The room is on its own floor but it can be a minor inconvenience when it comes to noise.
23964717,261048696,2018-05-05,120340653,Marija,Lovely brand new apartment host was very responsive and kind. Would recommend!
5345792,61760739,2016-02-08,4780873,Nick,Beautifully designed apartment with spectacular views and in a really convenient location close to Mission Noe Valley and Castro. I stayed for 2 weeks and Leo and Daniel were great hosts really welcoming. Would definitely recommend.

11122531,268367273,2018-05-24,182983201,Dania,Amanda's place in Noe Valley was super comfortable and clean! All the right touches like coffee maker and bottled water were waiting for me. If I wasn't already awake I probably never would have heard the pitter-patter of little feet upstairs that she forewarns about!  Amanda provides great notes on how to get around the neighborhood and there are very convenient eateries close by. Proximity to the J-Church muni line made getting into the heart of San Francisco super easy.
7680348,108152278,2016-10-14,6957821,Julen,"I spent almost two weeks in Alexis' place and it was indeed a smooth comfortable and pleasant stay.

Location is great very close to Castro and Mission with lots of great restaurants in the nearby — don't miss out on recommendations from your host. If you like jogging you will be relatively close to the Golden Gate Park.

The apartment is big and has all to cover your needs. Most importantly the room is quiet and the bed is extremely comfortable so rest at night is assured."
5998790,496668399,2019-07-27,65270373,Kierra,This place is wonderful! Ewa and Jules are great hosts and the space is beautiful. The location is great and I felt very at home for it being my first time in the city. I would highly recommend staying here!
1645724,24250202,2014-12-23,9842578,James,The room that Grace provides is large well appointed and clean. I hardly saw Grace parents the whole time but when I needed something they were there in a moment. Great medium between respecting privacy and being available. Location is a bit far from town and a few minorly unsavory neighbors but totally fine. Great value and a pleasant room to stay in!
14266916,489387948,2019-07-16,53347270,(Email hidden by Airbnb),Clean and comfortable. Outside space was charming perfect for morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. Host communicated quickly. We would definitely stay here again.
9347891,96900448,2016-08-25,27353716,Eric,The apartment is lovely and has such an awesome garden. The neighborhood is quiet and right next to Golden Gate Park and the botanical gardens. Exactly what I was looking for. Chris was very helpful and provided a ton of info about the neighborhood and San Francisco. I would definitely come back!
8276309,466916464,2019-06-09,21544813,Ami,Nathan's place was very clean quiet and the location was excellent to the Bart and downtown bars/restaurants. The communication  was also very clear and smooth; would recommend 100% to anyone visiting San Francisco and the downtown area.
12026856,82446965,2016-06-27,34933456,Andy,Our stay at Maria's was fantastic. Although Maria was out of town her instructions before and during our trip (via a well labeled house) helped us get in and out of the house easily. The neighborhood is quiet beautiful and well situated for getting around town.
7226841,520033873,2019-08-29,43273312,Brian,Nadia’s place is great. Good restaurants within walking distance and staying with her is much less expensive than SF hotels!
14426130,176827515,2017-07-31,97358906,Jeanette,Had a great stay at David's place. He was the perfect host and his place was a home away from home for me. David was great company and I had as much company or space as I wanted. The place was just as described - clean spacious and comfortable. It is a reasonable distance from downtown but public transport is good as described and the price comfort and atmosphere more than make up for the travel. I'm sure I'll be back in SF and I'll definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay David! 
18026441,335985548,2018-10-13,5408595,Casear,The room is small without windows but the kitchen is very great. The place is safe and convenient. Sam is a great man. He can help for any problem you have. Nice place for bussiness trip.
12930338,319960915,2018-09-07,40959486,Kaitlyn,Anna made this entire process a breeze. I was in at strange enough hours that we never met in person  but I still didn’t have to dedicate any extra time to logistics because she was so thorough and quick to respond to questions. Parking required precision but not ample time and the provided coffee brought light to foggy mornings!
21645603,540553866,2019-10-03,44470729,Nima,Our team enjoyed the space so much that they asked me to consider it for their future trips! Quite the endorsement! Phyllis was also great and would definitely consider booking in the future!
20367796,213735280,2017-11-22,97316366,Rosa Maria,The house is super clean and it smells very good all the time the hosts really have thought about everything a guest needs the neighborhood is quiet and is close to the Golden Gate Park to give you an idea of where it is situated. The pillows and bed are very comfortable and clean. Our room was really really small but we saw that the other rooms were bigger so it depends on what room you book. We felt very safe all the time the atmosphere at the house is very nice
6092049,96614872,2016-08-23,63133960,Kali,Dan and Jorge went above and beyond to make this a wonderful trip. We arrived early on Sunday morning and Dan graciously allowed us to drop our bags off before check-in time. He invited us into his home and gave us a fantastic orientation on the city! He knows and loves SF and his recommendations were spot on. The place itself is perfect!! So much space and better than any hotel. The kitchen was fully stocked with coffee tea and various snacks. There is a beautiful deck to sit and enjoy coffee on. We had so much fun and couldn't get over how lucky we'd been to find this place. It is truly an oasis! On our last day Dan was again flexible and allowed us to leave our bags until we left for the airport. We loved chatting with Dan and Jorge and hope to stay with them again if we find ourselves in SF. Can't recommend this place enough!
13082310,173142816,2017-07-22,132531602,Brian,Bernat was a great host. He was very accomodating and was very quick to respond. The place was very nice and in a great location as advertised.
1725853,45770005,2015-09-06,31529384,Claire,The apartment was absolutely beautiful - all the mod cons and exceptionally clean and well presented. Alex and Lina made us feel very welcome and we could not have asked for a better place to experience San Francisco from. There was a MUNI stop essentially at the end of the street which made it super easy to access the city. Thanks very much for having us!
4897143,485904002,2019-07-11,218779384,Aaron,Awesome neighborhood that’s easy to access from the BART station. Lots of food options around. The staff is super down to earth. Awesome dinner/breakfast provided. Rooms were a a comfortable temperature. Showers and bathrooms were extra clean. This was by far one of the best hostel experiences I’ve had. Make sure you check what’s on the calendar for the evening!

I'd definitely stay here again on future work trips! 
8739,9516323,2014-01-01,8962340,Carolyn,What a wonderful rental! Wendy & Ivan’s home is beautiful! AND it was very quiet and very clean. I loved the claw foot bath tub. We stayed for about a week loved the area and all it had to offer--Tartine’s Bakery is a must!! There were coffee shops and artsy shops for picking up gifts. The BART is close by and so convenient to head downtown. The weather was marvelous too; unseasonably warm for the end of December. This was one of our best trips to San Francisco. Wendy and Ivan also Kate and Fernando were very helpful and hospitable hosts. We would return in a heartbeat. Having never booked through Airbnb we were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to book on-line through the site how good the communication was with our hosts and just in general how well it all came together. Carolyn & Ed

465723,148897192,2017-05-01,42726144,Irene,"Shiela's place in West Portal was perfect for for our exploration of not only San Fran but some great spots nearby. Very convenient to public transportation and close to freeways for trips to the wine country. West Portal itself was great for restaurants and cafes. The residence itself was well  
 supplied with kitchen items and such and with a Safeway just down the street we were able to plan a good breakfast each day before we went exploring. Would highly recommend Sheila's place and she herself was friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Gave good tips for navigating the neighborhood. A 5 star experience. "

6543813,88139251,2016-07-23,3049455,Gregory,Leonard was an amazing host for my four night stay. He was gracious friendly and an excellent conversationalist. In fact it was a highlight of my stay to have several conversations about art politics and even genetics. I would enjoy staying with him and his partner Harvey again the next time I am in San Francisco. Their home is beautiful the bedroom is comfortable and I was able to get a good night sleep every night. I highly recommend this location.

Is located in a quiet neighborhood near to good places to diner or lunch public transportation and all you can need during your stay. Not far away to the main San Francisco attractions.
The rooms are very comfortable so the beds and all the installations. The place is really warm and with an special touch in any detail from Lainie and Charlie.
And the best of all: the great persons that Lainie and Charlie are really warm and nice people.
Really a place to be recommended!!"

The Secret Lounge is the perfect place to stay if you want to explore the city! The Mission District has tons of great restaurants and street art murals. BART is super close. 

The property itself is amazing; quaint yet modern. It is obvious that David and Tina have put a lot of though creativity and care into The Secret Lounge. It is cozy and well taken care of.  Such a lovely place! "

1738415,141589274,2017-04-03,36942563,Silja,I moved to San Francisco for a new job and I stayed in Donna's place for the first month. It felt like home immediately. The space is very relaxing with high ceilings wood floors and lots of good natural light. It's located on a quiet side street so it's very peaceful. The neighborhood is walkable with supermarkets restaurants etc. I'd stay here again any time. Donna was a great host and responded to all messages quickly. Thank you Donna!
9716652,266818878,2018-05-20,57005940,Kris,We enjoyed our stay in San Francisco.  The location was easy to find and is close to all the city highlights.  Virgilio was so accommodating and was super sweet.  The bathroom was not in the room but down the hall.  However it was close and didn't create a problem.  We felt safe and the price was great compared to hotels in the city
1995487,257595894,2018-04-26,34795942,Jennifer,Michael’s loft is just beautiful. It instantly felt like home. Everything was super clean and stylish! We loved sitting on the deck to eat dinner and we loved the location. My bff and I are homebodies and like to lay in bed and eat snacks and watch shows whenever we can get out of town for a little while. We loved that there was Netflix and Hulu programmed into the TV and the most delicious chocolates waiting for us when we checked in! Had the best little time during our overnight stay and would love to visit again soon. <3

Deb was the perfect host greeting us with a bottle of wine many snacks and lost of tips for sightseeing and exploring. The apartment is beautiful and completely comfortable. Walking distance to the Castro and Haight street. Parking was never a problem and the area is very private and quite. Randal Museum park was a short walk and had a great dog park for our pup to run around. If you're looking for a lovely place right in the city but far enough away from the crowds and tourist this is your place!

5548977,226106931,2018-01-08,71407496,Jacob,"We had an amazing time at Todd and Tatyana's place. The room was perfect for everything we needed and the little touches like fancy soaps and heaters that heat the floor really show great attention to detail. It was almost a shame that we could only stay a few nights. 

We never met Tatyana but Todd was extremely accommodating and a wonderful host. The place was also within walking distance of the League of Honor Point Lobos a CVS and several restaurants and shops.  We loved everything about it and will certainly be looking to stay over again. Thanks again Todd!"

4957143,86099573,2016-07-14,55502495,Chris,"With the help of Tom and Beth's amazing apartment San Francisco is now our favorite city in the US. The flat was perfect with an incredible layout and all the amenities expected and more.

Beth has put a huge amount of time and effort into a 'welcome' book that provided all of the recommendations that you could need. We used this book as our San Francisco to do list and not once did it disappoint.

We didn't have a car with us and found we could walk almost anywhere we wanted to go or if not than an UBER was only 2 seconds away.

Amazing place and very warm and welcoming hosts - highly recommended."
28251404,421156129,2019-03-08,9604522,Brian,"11/10. We were lucky to be the first airbnb guests in Tristan's newly renovated home and the experience was WAY beyond expectations. The photos don't do justice and Tristan went out of his way to accommodate us. We'll definitely be staying here again on future trips to SF. 

The house is one of those rare so-nice-I'm-surprised-it's-on-Airbnb ones and is located on a quiet street with ample parking just a quick walk down the hill to the muni for easy access downtown. 

Look no further. You won't be disappointed."

David's place was as advertised clean close to shops and restaurants and I had no trouble finding parking even during the busy holiday season.  I will definitely be contacting David again in the near future on my return visits to the Bay Area.

1578597,268712396,2018-05-25,5008026,Janice,"We only had one night to spend in SF this visit. We were lucky to find this great spot! It's a small space but very cleverly designed to be plenty big enough for 2--and for us a small dog. There's a deck and back yard access that is great. The view of the bay is fantastic. We took our coffee (thoughtfully provided) outside and could watch our dog check out the chickens while we enjoyed the gorgeous view.
This place has easy parking which is a huge help in the city and is also close to the Mission and lots of great sites. Highly recommend. Our hosts were available for questions and really nice as well."
6970746,39797318,2015-07-26,36665433,Raul,Laurie and Rebecca made us feel very welcome in there home.

4902855,25579227,2015-01-19,24596657,Matt,Tony and Lloyd were very helpful. They got us to the place and helped us find parking with ease. Lloyd was very accommodating holding our luggage and making sure we had everything we need. The price was good. It was a simple room with a shared bathroom and several other rooms on a couple floors of the building...kind of like a very basic airbnb motel actually. A little chilly at first but plenty warm at night. The location is good...we were able to walk to Chinatown Market st. and other good spots. The walk down to Market on Hydes is a bit sketchy (i.e. homeless druggies etc.) but we made it through with no incident....just wouldn't want to make that walk on your own probably. For about $100 a night I'd recommend it as a budget spot if your not able to find a similar priced hotel in the same area which is difficult. 
18507951,327360543,2018-09-23,185856894,Andrew,"Diana's place was perfect for us and was exactly as advertised. Diana made the stay even better with thoughtful touches like meeting us on arrival stocking the fridge with some foods and responsiveness to any questions we had. 
The location was great for us - we had no vehicle so used transit - and there were several bus options within very easy walking distance.  Diana fully respected our privacy and we enjoyed a very comfortable stay in her spacious room. I have no hesitation in recommending Diana's place to any other travelers to San Francisco."
680288,33380854,2015-05-27,419799,Darcel,Loved this cottage!  We loved the location:  adjacent to the action while peaceful and private. Ken and Richard were great hosts with detailed suggestions and we are happy they shared their home with us!
13169268,234683756,2018-02-13,145725333,Ana Celeste,"This place was GREAT! We fly in for just a few days for a quick birthday getaway and it was everything we could have asked for. Although we needed up in a room that faced the wall it was so stylish clean and comfortable. I love the jazz playing in the halls when you leave the elevator and the cute post cards on the magnet wall that show you how to use things like the shower heater fan etc. Location is perfect for someone wanting to get a great city experience of SF walking distance to most places downtown. Clothing & pharmacies just a block and a half away and SFMOMA is only about a 7 min walk away. 

We were able to check in at 11am because our room was ready and that was a great way to start our stay. Will definitely book again."
7143032,49400791,2015-10-03,31174741,Angel,"The place was very comfortable. It is small but the basics are there. Place is kept clean as well. 

The negatives I have would be more at the lobby / reception area so I'm not really holding it against Jordan. It is kept very messy and the receptionist in the morning was very rude. The one later in the day made up for it though. "
91957,106141465,2016-10-04,11826990,Alix,"Overall we had a great time at Joy's. We were in town for Hardly Strictly Bluegrass (from Alaska and Tahoe) and liked the fact that it was within walking distance to the park. We finally got to meet Joy and her husband on our way out one morning and they were both super friendly and welcoming. 

Pros: 
-location: both in proximity to the music venue that we were going to as well as plenty of easy access to cafes coffee and wine shops 
-beautiful: house was really pretty and had very tasteful decor and upgrades 
-communication: Joy was very quick to communicate with us on anything 

Cons: 
-apparently cleaning crew did not refill the TP so we ran out after the first day and a half and could not locate any more. Nor could we find tissues or even a roll of paper towels. Once we notified her Joy left 4 rolls for us the next morning. 
-the bathroom sinks did not drain very well and quickly filled with standing water. An easy fix with liquid plumr or equivalent. 

We had originally planned for 4 of us but then 2 of our friends' airbnb fell through so we invited them to stay with us at the last minute. We notified Joy and she was accepting with the extra person charge. The sleeper sofa that they used was reportedly ""very uncomfortable"" so a fair warning to anyone who is planning to utilize it. On the other hand my boyfriend and I were able to sleep in the master bedroom with an extremely comfortable queen bed so we have zero complaints in this area. 

Joy made herself available to us if we needed but didn't try to step on our toes. We weren't at the house all that much in general as we spent most of the day out and about and being well into our 30's and unable to party/recover like we used to a decade ago we were in bed by midnight pretty much every night. 

Overall we had a great time in large part due to getting to stay together at a nice house in the city.  I think that this house is more appropriate for 4 people rather than 6-8 unless 2 people are relatively low maintenance with their sleeping comfort. The sleeper futon looked relatively comfortable but would not have slept more than 1 averaged sized/height person in it very comfortably in my opinion.

It is pretty private and we got to use it all for ourselves at night! Her place is in the Noe Valley area and it is stress free parking. The quiet neighborhood  offers all kinds of shops and a selection of dinning options. It has a town feel stroll on 24th ave that is just a block away from her place. Eileen is indeed a graceful host. She made us feel at easy with her friendly demeanor. Giving us dining suggestions and information about the neighborhood. We did not have to use city transportation but there are several routes mention in her host's welcome book. I will return to her place for sure!

We found the space to be as described in the listing and the tips were very useful - we visited the Cable Car Museum on her recommendation and enjoyed it immensely!  

Abby was a gracious host - she even left a nice bottle of wine for us which we enjoyed at dinner."

1989997,18226498,2014-08-24,7183330,Joonas,Michelle and Jeffrey were great hosts and the location was very peaceful. Rarely in big city you can get such views from your window. It really felt like home here.
971069,20659976,2014-10-03,21172547,Mark,The room and host were both great!  Jessica was welcoming helpful and friendly but non-intrusive.  The room was exactly as expected and the neighborhood (North Beach) had great options for food and goods as well as a laundromat that was close.  I really feel like I finally got to experience what living in SF is like even though I've stayed there multiple times before.  Definitely recommended!

From the tiny sewing kits to wide range of hair-products luxorius bathroom (huge shower) and private balconies extremely surprisingly good tv with hundreds of HD channels the huge closet Nespresso machine fridge sofa very good bed and duvets own entrance best neighborhood! what else can there be?? I can’t name a thing that was missing. 
Only one word to describe this Airbnb arrangement: PERFECT!

Thank you so much Nancy you were very sweet and easy to talk to and always there for us to assist with any problems we had :) "

17010389,153043637,2017-05-19,33116487,Nora,"Carl and Michael were so helpful! Really great hosts. Checking in was easy and stress-free. We stayed in the studio a room with a small kitchen and bed... we only shared a bathroom. 
The location was super. I was attending a conference downtown on the Embarcadero and the house was within walking distance to the metro... took me about 15 minutes total to get there in the morning. 
We pretty much walked everywhere with the exception of a few Lyfts to go out at night the location was perfect... close to fun shops and yummy restaurants and cafes. 
I will definitely look to stay here again next year! Thanks Carl and Michael!!!"

13175533,339615798,2018-10-21,101217037,Alex,"San Francisco is one of our favorite places to visit and when we stumbled upon Ocean Beach two years ago we knew this was an area we’d like to spend more time in. Simone and Simon’s place is in the perfect neighborhood and a brisk 20 minute(ish) walk to the beach. Before booking Simone was easy to communicate with and very helpful in answering any of our questions. Once we were confirmed Simone’s accommodating personality was exactly what we were looking for. Not only did she have the place ready early but she let us store our bags until our flight left later in the day.

Besides great communication and hospitality Simone’s seemingly thought of everything. The space is comfortable homey and nicely decorated. We were pleasantly surprised by the robes and slippers she provided for us as well as the many supplies found in the kitchen cabinets. Next time we’re in Ocean Beach we would definitely stay at Simone’s place again. It was a delightful local experience. 

Love

Nikki Charnstrom"
2747383,17039197,2014-08-06,14093392,Dominique,The Beach villa was perfect for our family particularly clean and quiet. The street is stratégic with the tramway to the dowtown just near the Beach or the golden gate parc for walking or running. It's easy to park his car and Brian is really friendly. We enjoy our hollidays in SF!
10321776,149138794,2017-05-02,7939241,Trish,Amrita is a wonderful host and very responsive. Even though there is no kitchen we managed several meals with a trip to Whole Foods and the microwave. It was wonderful to be so close to the beach. The neighborhood is very quiet and parking was easy - very big deal in San Francisco!
16204265,129212606,2017-01-29,110524441,Bin,The place is amazing! It's newly renovated and everything was super clean. Koncha told me she brings in a cleaner to clean everything before and after every guest! What I liked most was how close the place was to everything we wanted to check out. Bars boba places restaurants across the street were all in walking distance. Poki the french terrier is super cute and friendly!! The room was warm (literally) which was important for me it being SF in winter and all. Overall our trip was awesome with the help of Koncha and her space!

561148,3189545,2012-12-30,1919280,Alison,"We had an excellent stay.  The house is in such a convenient location everywhere we wanted to go and all the amenities we needed were close by.  The Hagler's are such excellent host and prepared the house in such a way to make sure we would be comfortable during our stay there.
And what a stay it was I can't decide if it was the kitchen or the fireplace or the basement garage that was our favourite place.  Not too mention the cool sound system they had wired in their house.  
If I needed a place in San Francisco again I wouldn't hesitate to try this place again."
10137578,154280149,2017-05-23,48199770,Nancy,Great place to stay. Quick response to questions. Bathroom was clean and the bedroom was comfortable. Location was easy to find. Place was as advertised. Would recommend if you are looking for a quick place to stay in SF. 
220418,8622216,2013-11-09,4681336,Livia,Josh was a wonderful host. We really enjoyed using the biked to ride to the bridge and eating the muffins. The room was clean and tidy and we loved the whole experience. 
1421937,186848711,2017-08-25,37910656,Jennyane,"Dee's Airbnb was exactly as advertised. It was central to every thing that we wanted to do and the places we wanted to visit. The home was very clean and beautiful in it's Victorian charm. It is located in a nice and quiet neighborhood so you can definitely count on getting a peaceful night of rest when coming back from exploring San Francisco. We booked a private bedroom that included a private bathroom. The bedroom came with a beautiful view (Yep! Like the one in the photo!). Water yummy snacks TV and movie DVDs were also complimentary. I forgot to pack shampoo and conditioner but both were provided!

Last but definitely not least Dee's dog Sammy Doggie was so adorable! He was so friendly and loving! Over all we're very glad that we booked our stay at Dee's Airbnb. Highly recommended and I would definitely stay here for future trips to San Francisco."

14505006,139889608,2017-03-26,62837946,Michael,The home is located in a wonderful area near North Beach Chinatown and just a short walk to the Embarcadero area. It has wonderful views and it tucked away so it still feels private. 
19478755,330531288,2018-09-30,44505411,Matt,"We highly recommend this place! The location is perfect - close to so many San Fran attractions (we didn’t need to use our car the entire time we stayed). The place is super clean and the bedroom very spacious. 
Kathy was so sweet kind and accomodating - we were greeted with her offering us hot drinks after a long drive and she even made us breakfast each morning!
Our time in San Fransisco was so much richer for the local tips and kind hospitality she provided. 
We will definitely come back and stay at Kathy’s if we’re in San Fran again :-)"
394575,12742751,2014-05-10,1096839,Brice,I stayed here for 5 nights as a business traveler attending a conference. Everything was excellent and as advertised. Easy commute downtown using 67 and BART. Check-in was smooth and communication with Mike & Nic was great. I had a rental car and parking was no problem on the street. Cortland St is a short walk for groceries and restaurants. I tried Little Nepal Moki's Taco Los Altos and Vega - all very good. I had to work every evening so appreciated the large desk and excellent WIFI connection. No hesitation recommending this studio for your stay in San Francisco.
8152867,508407667,2019-08-12,116326562,Cynthia,"The location was excellent especially for my purposes - 10 min walk to Golden Gate Park.

10437411,203275707,2017-10-14,30224207,Natalie,"What an amazing studio in the heart of Ashbury/Heights neighborhood. The studio is very clean and has all the amenities you will need for the trip. Chip and Angela send out a welcome guidebook with very relevant and good information and suggestions of places to go eat and see. In the unit the personal touches such as small chocolates on the pillows a binder with historical information and pictures of the neighborhood ... made it all the more a memorable stay.
You are missing out if you do not stay at this studio in San Francisco. Their hospitality is unmatched !!!!"
4902855,348895427,2018-11-15,191226367,Richard,Thanks Tony would book again
7343277,74109567,2016-05-13,8091188,Martin,Easy check in even in the middle of the night. Fun hostel atmosphere! I wish I had more time here. If I go back to San Francisco on my own or with a friend I will definitely stay here. Parking was a bit of a pain and I would recommend not having a car here at all.
6120540,269081567,2018-05-26,123723805,Caroline,"Very good stay at Pam's and Philip's. Pam was very nice and helpfull and we got on very well with her as well as with Ruppert (the little dog).
Buses were not very far. Long walks along the Ocean could have been nice if the weather had permitted it. :)
We really enjoyed our stay. And I would go back if I ever comme back to SF."
33942157,554140539,2019-10-25,12736197,Gisele,"I would definitely stay here again -- clean rooms comfortable bed and quiet enough that I got a very good night sleep. Neighborhood is dicey but tge Central location is great for business close to BART. 

Plus:

Very clean. Attractive vintage decor. Nice bathroom. Big TV. Good wifi. Filtered water machine.

Minuses: 

I couldn't figure out how to unplug the alarm clock and turn it off.

And also there is no service in this hotel. It would be nice to have a coffee maker. The clerk said you could order a coffee maker and have it sent up to your room but the phone in the room didn't work. Even a hot water spigot in the lobby would be nice so we can make tea."
17107439,188549638,2017-08-29,76275395,Jennifer,The location was really great. It's within walking distance to a lot of attractions right by the Powell cable cars and east to take transit from. The room we got did not match the photos at all but it wasn't really a big deal because we still got two beds. The only issue we had was that the shower in our room wasn't working very well but we were able to use the communal one instead. The front desk was great very helpful whenever we had questions.
33943537,469005832,2019-06-13,19635035,Max,Awesome host! Returned a bracelet that I accidentally left at the house eventhough I live in Malaysia.

442397,502648223,2019-08-04,242251007,Marie,Marianne's place was the perfect location for us.  There were 4 adults in our party and the place had more than adequate space for us.  Appliances and décor was in perfect condition.  The location felt very safe and secure and was outside of the hustle bustle of the city but also extremely convenient to the Muni line Golden Gate Park the ocean the SF Zoo and plenty of local grocers and convenience stores.

32866238,559773881,2019-11-04,32903855,Jeffrey,We wanted to stay close to family in and this was a great location. It’s also unique that it feels like its own space. Like others have said you will hear noise as soon as someone is up and on the main floor.
18209966,273006335,2018-06-04,113836442,Simon,"Super stylish place. Outstanding location - strip of restaurants and bars just 5 mins walk away.

My mum loves the kitchen Shaun gots all the things that you need to use for a simple meal.
Also Shaun is very friendly. We got two heavy luggage and he does offer his help to bring them down to the first floor:)"
8717641,434396553,2019-04-07,64800344,Patricia,Can’t say enough about the lovely garage apartment. So well located with every need anticipated. Beautiful garden. So appreciated the extra touches: excellent coffee teas restaurant tips and activity ideas. Host responded quickly to all inquiries. Would highly recommend and would definitely return.
238204,7836176,2013-10-05,8715785,Paula,The apartment was very clean and roomy.  The bed slept well shower hot.  We didn't cook but can confirm a spotless refrigerator and kitchen area. The apartment is located a few blocks from the ocean which was very nice.  Jennifer provided parking for our rental car we had for 2 days.  Public transportation a block away.  Use it often and don't be taken in by the Hop-On/Hop-Off buses. NOT worth it...you can easily navigate the city on public transportation a LOT cheaper (buses are more frequent also)  This was our first trip to San Francisco. We thought the city was ok...but being from a big city (Chicago) we don't get excited by other big cities!! For us a 2-3 day trip around the city would be enough.  It was cool to see the Golden Gate and Alcatraz. Golden Gate Park is beautiful but be warned it is HUGE.  The 'attractions' all cost to enter. I suggest if you like to bike ride to rent one across from the Japanese Tea Garden entrance (it's a bit behind a pavillion - if you don't see it ask someone at the Tea Garden to point it out). If you rent a car check out Armstrong State Park (about a 2 hr ride north) on your way you can visit the Korbel winery where they grow and bottle Korbel champagne.  A short tour is free and you get a free tasting also.  By the way if you like a good Italian meal go to the Gold Mirror restaurant on Taravel.  Happy travels!
16872797,211415475,2017-11-12,35028603,Jeannie,Marie is an excellent host! She serves delicious breakfast every morning and offered to drive me to the bus stop! Highly recommend this home!!!!
631635,5241262,2013-06-20,4775572,Jorg,"Betty is an awesome host. While we never met her the communication with her was great and super fast and all questions of us weary travelers (such as ""How do we get to your flat?"") were answered promptly and with great detail. We loved the flat Castro and San Francisco in general. The flat is well connected to public transport which is a great bonus in SFX.
I highly recommend her and (hopefully) will come back!
Cheers

25463,924693,2012-02-16,1583826,Thomas,I had a really excellent stay in Patrick’s wonderful apartment; my room was clean neat and hosts a great view. Patrick is a very nice and caring host always ready with good advises on what to do in SF and where to eat in the neighborhood (e.g. I got excellent cappuccinos at Café Solei and authentic Indian food at the Indian Oven). The whole apartment is stylishly decorated with a great sense for details and the location is excellent with short walk to public transportation. Thanks Patrick for sharing your fantastic home with me :)
5480795,214897963,2017-11-26,45661249,Isabel,Nice place to stay. Very central in San Francisco parking spot and some breakfast is included. We even had a small kitchen.

3486460,156216601,2017-05-29,13125325,Jeremy,Emily's place was great to explore San Francisco out of. Potrero hill itself was a beautiful neighborhood to experience and the view of the city from Emily's was breathtaking. Emily was warm and welcoming allowing us use and access to the kitchen and common areas. The room was comfortable and her cats were the friendliest. The house is close to the mission district and market street and very convenient to be exploring the city from. Staying at Emily's definitely elevated the trip. 
10088395,180222771,2017-08-09,32078819,Juliana,Stephen is wonderful and the space is amazing. The Castro is a great neighborhood and Stephen's place is walking distance from many of our favorite neighborhood staples. The room and bathroom were very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Amenities were perfect. We didn't have a chance to really use the outdoor space but it is lovely. Highly recommend Stephen's place for anyone visiting San Fran! 
13021294,103622156,2016-09-23,41536309,Dan,I loved the place.  It was VERY clean was just as described and the communication was great.  This is a great spot to stay in SF.  Literally steps away from the Top of the Mark (best view in SF).  Easy access to trolley.   Just a great experience.  Heated bathroom floor was my favorite!!!

1989997,153044096,2017-05-19,56183629,Angela,Lovely hideaway in the iconic Haight neighbourhood. Quiet and clean building close to parks cafes restaurants bars etc. Public transport links within a minute walk away. Homely place with Michelle and Jeffrey happy to share local knowledge go on walks and teach you about all things culinary! Food was absolutely delicious as was the coffee and homemade brews! Thank you Michelle and Jeffrey for sharing your home with me.

The Room is exactly as shown on the picture small very clean separate bathroom and because there is an extra w-lan in the room you'll have really quick Internet Access which was Great. With Uber it takes you about 20 Minutes to the Airport and about the Same Time downtown to Pier 39. Great stay ! "

258873,33357443,2015-05-27,11520525,Jacqueline,We were greeted by Greg Irina's housemate. Greg is very welcoming and helpful. He showed us our room and the apartment layout details etc.  He was also very helpful with any questions we had and making sure we were comfortable. This is a shared apartment setup with four bedrooms - 2 of which are Airbnb rooms and one shared bathroom and kitchen.  The bedroom is good sized with a small table/chairs and closet space towels are provided.  Wifi was challenging. The location is excellent; within walking distance to many key areas metro etc.  Great restaurants are just a block away.

27699365,548439358,2019-10-17,117183089,Laurel,We had medical testing for my brother for 2 days at UCSF so having the apartment be in walking distance to the hospital was very nice. The street is very quiet and the apartment was a nice place to rest for my husband who's sick with liver cancer. With the added fees the stay cost a bit more than I was completely okay with but since there was 4 of us I figured staying at a hotel would have been only $200 cheaper and this way we could spend the evenings together. Sam was very responsive. Note: Like many apartments in SF there's an initial set of stairs to the second floor that can be daunting for those in frail health. We recommend Sam's place.
878935,51524685,2015-10-21,29456748,Lauren,We had a great stay at Ashley's place! She kindly provided bagels for our first breakfast which was a very nice touch. The apartment was even more convenient to public transit and great restaurants than expected. We were very happy with our stay.
8195144,564800269,2019-11-16,82652419,Barbara,Stylish studio in quiet neighborhood. Very clean. Proximity to UCSF important since I  was in SF for knee surgery.  Plenty of free parking in the neighborhood.

16079346,359978360,2018-12-18,112852775,Dominic,"We really much appreciated the 10 nights at Monettes place and we were overwhelmed by the charme of the house and Montettes family.

The room ist really big with a large bathroom. It is clean and quiet because whether the house nor the neighborhood is noisy. As it is an offer by airbnb you should not expect a perfect room like in a hotel. Anyway from our point of view the comfort is even better then in a hotel because you are free to use the big nice and very clean kitchen. If you decide to live there a few days you will live in a really lovely and charming place with great people who treat you as one of their own. Monette is open-minded and knows best about nice places in and around the neighborhood.  

The house is located near to the famous Haight-Street the lovely Cole-Valley and the Golden Gate Park as well as to the Twin Peaks. Moreover you can reach out easy for the mission district where you find a lot of nice and unique shops. You drive about 30 Minutes to Downtown with the ""muni"". But we would not recommend to live in Downtown because it is noisy and growded.  

We definitly will stay again at Monettes place when we travel to SF because this is ""airbnb at its best""."
16176101,158181250,2017-06-05,41267022,Phin,The location is fantastic just off market st and close to the water. The rooms were simple but good for the value.
8763407,218941377,2017-12-15,31902467,Tom,Great guys great place great neighborhood! Awesome base to learn about SF meet other travelers explore the mission district. It was perfect for me!

Familier freundlich schön eingerichtet und wenn ich fragen wurde mir geholfen. Mein Bike konnte ich auch in der Garage einstellen. Ideal gelegen wenn man mit dem Flugzeug anreist und dann ein Auto hat.
Michelle danke für diese erste Übernachtungen grüsse Franz"
19101632,422288358,2019-03-10,32517952,Fernando,"The flat is conveniently located near the public transport so the access to other parts of the city is easy and quick. Although it is not very close to SF downtown you can have better mobility than other more central locations. It is also few blocks from restaurants and supermarkets.

It is on the basement of a house. There is no windows apart from bedrooms which have windows facing a wall. The neighborhood is very quiet and the residents are careful about noises but we could hear from the floor above more than we expected due to the thin slab between us. It bothered us a bit in the first few days when we went to bed much earlier due to the time difference between Brazil and SF.

The cleaning could be better. They were kind and responsive in all communications."
21282635,547195074,2019-10-14,64237922,Jeff,Wonderful clean and bright space located a short drive to downtown.

24043373,435524944,2019-04-10,242982915,Bruno,"The apartment is very proper and located in a calm and secure area. There were some shops close to the apartment. The distance to the center of the city is only 15 minutes by car. 
The host was very friendly and answered our questions very quickly. 
We had a great time in San Francisco and we would book this apartment again for a second trip to this great city."
9695480,273296560,2018-06-05,169399545,Dj,A great place to stay that I would recommend to anyone!

14990478,154250199,2017-05-23,11041530,Ping,It was a great place to stay very central within SF and we had everything we needed! Eddie gave us all information beforehand and we felt very comfortable! Thanks a lot for letting us stay there! :-)
7902505,109463286,2016-10-21,15297161,Ivan,Sarah is a wonderful host. I got instructions how to get in the place plus some guidance about the neighborhood from the instructions she left. The apartment was nice and cosy very client and it was at very convenient location for me. I enjoyed my stay it was great experience overall.
22296862,271209681,2018-05-31,57790372,Tadeo,Beautiful house very comfortable and not far from main SF points of interest. Good value considering the price of staying in downtown SF. Amazing garden. Nice kitchen. Recommended! 
774323,44898240,2015-08-30,6116517,Judie,Award-winning hostess is top notch in every way; Jan makes everyone feel at ease in her very tasteful and comfortable home- immediately. She's great to talk to an expert on her city its environs and many other subjects; her cat Thriller is a wonderful addition- as nice a cat as ever.  I'm not even a cat person but I love Thriller (a well-kempt and polite cat).  It's fun just to watch Thriller.
14726839,102917694,2016-09-19,52023001,Emma,Kinda was a wonderful host. Her home was both beautiful and welcoming. She went out of her way to ensure we were enjoying ourselves in the city. I recommend this place to all types of travelers! :) 
12815012,412512541,2019-02-15,231481886,Stephen,The house was amazing! Super clean and great location. Loved the windows and panoramic views. Would definitely stay again.
1421774,126676306,2017-01-13,4948542,Drew,Great location for a quick business trip. Hosts were very helpful and very responsive.
17622881,249199751,2018-04-01,28644784,Shally,Kyle is very kind and helpful. He checked us in in person and provided helpful local tips. The place is nice and neat as described. Even I greatly appreciate Kyle and his family being mindful of their noise level. Sound still carries throughout the house as the room is located in the basement. Bring your earplugs or expect some walking noises above you. Overall it is great value for the price.
4897143,110350354,2016-10-25,21702383,Jayne,It was nice for anyone needing a short stop or looking for a back packer feel for their SF visit. The location is not dodgy and lively though def loud however the description makes a note of that. Overall decent due to transparent descriptions of the accommodation. 
381217,202536682,2017-10-11,49844571,José,The room its very good and the location it's amazing for visiting San Francisco thanks for all Scott

23584006,244489573,2018-03-18,86394207,Ellen Elizabeth,"Very nice space clean comfortable and convenient.  The hosts were super great with communication and responsiveness.

Thank you so much!

One caveat: the fact that bathrooms are shared means you are reliant on other guests' consideration (or lack thereof) and cleanliness (or lack thereof).  I realize this is no fault of the hosts who do a great job.  Perhaps there's some way for them to more strongly encourage people to clean up after themselves in consideration of others (i.e. clumps of hair in shower/tub and floor water all over floors/counters of bathroom--pretty simple stuff).

It would also help to be able to regulate heat in one's own room if possible."
20575733,206083335,2017-10-23,5180566,Fiona,"Clean comfortable room! The room is close to a neighbour which can affect noise-level/privacy. For the most part it's really quiet. 

My mom and I had a lovely stay at Cindy/Michelle's place. Michelle is quick to respond and attentive to guest needs. There was even an extra blanket for those cooler evenings. We met Cindy in the morning of our flight out and she was friendly and welcoming.

The place is a little further from typical SF tourist attractions but it's close to Ocean Beach Golden Gate Park and some great local restaurants :)."
26169782,516713996,2019-08-24,4596838,Eyal,"We had an easy check in (although we never met Victor or Jacqueline) and we have found a clean room which is exactly as was described. We didn't use the joint kitchen but it looked bright clean. 
Not always could we find a place to park but we have managed finding parking in the other street.
Beds were comfortable to sleep in."
11238527,82375928,2016-06-27,7556576,Tatiana,We liked the house! It was very cozy and warm! It was close to mission st with plenty of good restaurants and small shops. Communication with Ben and Amy was fast and productive. I would highly recommend staying at this house.
748256,22065370,2014-10-29,21099179,Leslie,Todo resultó excelente de acuerdo a lo esperado. Los anfitriones son excelentes personas nos ayudaron muchísimo.
21679018,463076233,2019-06-02,9801634,Marijn,Perfect place to stay to explore SF. The proximity of the airport is very convenient. There are a lot of nice café's nearby and on Saturdays you can visit the Alemany Farmer's Market. We didn't mind that the apartment was not in downtown SF. Especially if you're here for multiple days it is nice to stay in a more relaxing environment. Communication was fast and easy would recommend!
207980,84592088,2016-07-08,64288868,Marie,We had an amazing time staying in Bruce`s house. It is full equipped with everything we needed and we appreciated a lot the terrace (even the weather wasn`t sunny). We were group of six and the house was big enough. The check-in was easy - although we arrived very late Bruce was so kind and waited for us. Overall our stay was really pleasant and we totally recommend Bruce`s airbnb. 
30022449,464484534,2019-06-05,157063152,Matthew,A comfortable stay. Everything was catered for and the house had a definite San Francisco vibe to it.
9051149,439759800,2019-04-19,39092335,Adam,We had a great trip which was made even better by Elmer’s hospitality
7290262,427075502,2019-03-22,180403500,Ricardo,Awesome place nice and clean in a great neighborhood. Only a couple of blocks away from Market Street and public transportation options. Would  definitely stay here again if I return to San Francisco.
27437162,342856076,2018-10-29,44628579,Sarah,Laura's place was wonderful! It was tucked back in a quiet area but walking distance to local shops and restaurants and an easy lyft ride to anywhere in the city. The bed was so comfortable! Very clean and well stocked for anything you'd need!
3271517,406991539,2019-01-31,3792881,Littany,"Cort's place is nicely tucked away from the hustle of Lower Haight yet easily accessible by bus or train. The neighborhood has plenty of coffee shops bars and restaurants that are easy to get to in a short walk. 

The space itself does require you to climb a hand rail-less staircasewhich can be a little daunting with luggage in hand but one you're up to the room the bed is very comfortable and the shower is excellent! 

Cort was respectful of our space and time and very communicative. We had a nice stay."
15055277,174617283,2017-07-26,121590761,Deborah,You can't get a better value in this Union Square location! It's a simple hotel but clean and had everything we needed. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again!

29002725,461524652,2019-05-31,119992369,Donna,The place is extremely clean and was quiet at night. It is in a great location for exploring Chinatown. Additionally it's within walking distance to many popular touristy attractions. The only downside is finding parking but that's to be expected in SF in general. Overall a wonderful place to stay!
3549398,168636094,2017-07-09,131373081,Jackson,Michael's is a great place to stay! It's a really easy walk to the heart of the Castro and everything was just as pictured. The view from the patio is truly incredible
26566885,460637436,2019-05-29,4444673,Francisco,This is one of the best experiences I had so far in San Francisco using Airbnb. The room is very cozy and private; exactly what you need particularly if you are in the city for business. Very quiet at night. I love the big palm tree in the backyard! Easy access to 24th street BART. Best value possible in Bernal Heights.
1998111,16403075,2014-07-27,15528802,Jintana,Kenix's family is very nice. The house is so clean. We felt very comfortable. Thank you ^^
7788844,326632184,2018-09-22,57804595,Claudia,Gil was super helpful when it came to responding to messages. He also made our arrival easier by letting us drop our bags off before the check in time. The unit was clean and had all amenities. Unfortunately it was located further from the city than we thought. The transport wasn't very reliable and getting around by Uber was very expensive. We weren't too fond of the area and tried to stay in the city as long as possible as it seemed there wasn't much around.
997382,49677784,2015-10-05,1525004,Gerald,The neighborhood was great; great location and quiet. Josh was a great host and let me keep my bicycle in a secure storage area. The room was fine if small; everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. I hadn't expected the room to be large and the price was right. My only deduction from perfect is that Josh keeps the building dark; there was no porch light. I had to use my phone flashlight to find the entrance and also to make my way up the interior stairway.
9488665,433103066,2019-04-05,20167820,Amanda,"Dane’s place is awesome. It’s located in one of my favorite area of the city with everything you need around specially great bars and restaurant. He was there to do the check in and it was super flexible about the check in time too.
The apartment had everything we needed. Thanks Dane for sharing your amazing house with us these days :)"
1992217,328640256,2018-09-26,76471758,Jinki,일단 장소는 로컬지역에 있어서 멀다고 생각할 수도 있지만 오히려 이게 훨씬 큰 장점이 됩니다. 바로 걸어서 지역의 카페거리같은 곳을 갈 수 있었는데 이게 너무너무 좋았어요. 샌프란시스코에서의 경험 중에 가장 좋았던게 이 때의 경험입니다. 걸어서 5분정도 걸어가면 바로 있는 곳입니다(스타벅스 검색하시면 바로 그 길 쪽입니다.) 샌프란 자체가 언덕이 심해서 무조건 우버 이용하시고 우버 이용하시면 불편하신 점은 없으리라 생각됩니다. 아 그리고 멍뭉이가 짖을 수 있는데 겁먹지 마세용. 멍뭉이가 겁먹어서 짖는겁니당. 그 외 조식이 너무너무 좋았어요. 세심한 배려가 느껴졌답니다^_^
4902907,242343292,2018-03-11,82842716,Brianna,Room was as pictured! Never had an issue with the communal bathroom and shower. Location was great to walk to multiple places including the union square.

13497122,181436464,2017-08-12,15651925,Alexis,Jeff's house was the perfect stay for our trip! It's located in a beautiful quiet neighborhood of San Francisco. It's close to great food and coffee and only a short 20-30 minute drive to anything you'd want to see in the city. The place was very clean and the beds were very comfortable! Having Netflix in the living room was also a great plus. Next time I am visiting San Francisco I will happily stay here.
29634396,546566571,2019-10-13,87062786,Joann,If you’re looking for a great and easy to get to location Dominic’s place is perfect. Close to Union Square and away from the traffic congestion. The pictures show exactly what you’re getting. Modern hotel feel... with a  cozy at home touch; and clean! Our group is a bit OCD about cleanliness so we were very impressed. Dominic promptly responded to our questions and he even left us a nice bottle of wine! Check out the rooftop!! Great view and insta perfect! 
14907455,161375720,2017-06-17,135362723,Martin,Easy to check in at any time and even though  John isn't there he anwers immediately. The place is basic but clean. Hard to find parking space if you have a car. 
1926253,242406341,2018-03-11,55721011,Alexander,Jennifer was super organized and helpful.  She was great about communicating with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  The place was a great home base with a beautiful garden out side our window.
13603043,158872169,2017-06-08,4134071,Oivind,This is a lovely little apartment modern clean and exceptionally well appointed. Shal is a great host and reached out to make sure I had everything for a great stay including recommendations for the many neighborhood spots to check out.
10367010,193491813,2017-09-13,25654501,Kate,This is a great place to base yourself for a few days in San Francisco lovely room with all the amenities needed. Grocery store and restaurants in 10min walking distance. The metro is located just across the road be aware the journey takes around 40mins into downtown but we didn't find this any bother. Although we didn't meet Tatyana she was great at responding to any questions we had. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you Tatyana :)
28716670,355066878,2018-12-02,38168155,Vernon,I had a wonderful stay at Kameh's abode. Nice big room and what a fantastic location. Only have two gripes no locks on bedroom door for safety and heater needs to be better. But otherwise awesome place. Flexible and easy check in and out.  Big thanks to Kameh's hospitality and travel tips! Also guests were nice too.

5068486,97528453,2016-08-27,65915987,Bryan,"The unit is beautifully furnished and spacious. I loved the door to the back patio; being able to open the door and have the living room flow out onto the patio was awesome. The unit is in a cute quiet neighborhood and is easy walking distance (even for a four year old) to the Muni as well as numerous restaurants/shops. 

We will definitely stay here again next time we're in San Francisco; thanks Karen!"

4841027,333880054,2018-10-07,3320676,Natalya,I stayed at Jason’s place for 8 days. The whole apartment is on the second floor with lots of windows very bright and spacious. My bedroom was large with a very comfortable bed The linens and towels were good quality all cotton and Jason provided a much appreciated cotton bath robe. Kitchen had all necessary items for cooking and it was nice to be able to use dining and living rooms for leisurely meals and relaxation. All facilities were spotless clean. Communication was exceptionally easy - Jason replied right away and was very gracious in sharing his home made brownies and coffee and accommodating my other needs. The location was perfect - a bus stop was around the corner BART within 12 minutes walk Safeway and Whole Foods within easy walking distance and a couple of pleasant neighborhood spots for coffee and comfort food.  One needs to use the stairs to get to the second floor for those who have difficulties. Another circumstance to take into consideration for sensitive travelers is that there is a cigarette smell likely coming from the first floor through the common ducts which can be quite strong. It can be mitigated by opening the windows etc. but not always. Other than that Jason's place was absolutely great. I will definitely consider it for my next visit to San Francisco.
9563163,120759668,2016-12-11,39412499,James,A shelter from the storm! I arrived early soaked and tired. Dani and Darius worked hard to make it a nice stay. They gave hot tea towels and a warm bed. Scooter and Bella(the cats) kept me entertained. Although you are in the center of the city and surrounded by people the apt was VERY quiet! The room was fine and extremely soundproof as well. I wish I had a chance to come back and explore more of this city
3759246,559279236,2019-11-03,36482655,Megan,David’s place was perfect for our quick weekend getaway. He was very communicative and provided lots of recommendations about places nearby. The space has all the amenities we needed and was affordably priced.
567239,436729386,2019-04-13,38018242,Jacob,Ed and Judy are extremely friendly and hospitable and their place is absolutely gorgeous with a beautiful view of the city and only a short distance away from the main stretch of Noe. I felt almost as at-home at their place as I would in my own apartment and I would choose to stay with them again without a second thought.
16706877,148862159,2017-05-01,2894723,David,"If you have time here’s the DL for a review:
-Easy instructions for finding home and accessing lockbox
-Quiet secluded nice central A/C / heating system
-Furniture and appliances were new and clean
-Couch was comfy and easy to sleep on

The bedroom is a bit on the small side."
845480,77442456,2016-05-31,50294130,Azelina,Dolores is a very warm and helpful person and the master bedroom is extremely comfortable and spacious. This Airbnb is situated in a good safe neighbourhood and is good value for money. Public transportation into the city takes about 40 minutes. If you are travelling alone and are unused to American public transportation it can take you a while to get your head around. However once you do so it is manageable. If you are travelling in a group of have a car the distance will not prove an obstacle. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone staying in San Francisco.
1148625,472501923,2019-06-19,917495,Justin,Great spot central to the Upper Haight/Lower Haight/NOPA area of town which is my favorite. Tucked away from the main drag so no noise but easy to walk to restaurants and the best of the city and nearby Panhandle and GG Park. Would recommend.
9298491,95556785,2016-08-20,16596539,Eric,Great place in a convenient neighborhood.  I appreciated that it came with a parking space. Plenty of room for my party of 8. 
6326133,113261025,2016-11-11,3151303,Aleck,"Maureen provided a warm welcome and comfortable home during my stay in the beautiful Pacific Heights neighborhood. She provided an abundance of snacks and even took me on a tour through the Presidio. 
The suite is walking distance to all the trendy dining and shopping spots on Fillmore St. and a 10 minute walk to the Presidio's gorgeous hiking trails.
I'd recommend Maureen's suite to anyone traveling to SF and looking for a quiet neighborhood to call home."
727866,11007917,2014-03-17,11697403,Valentina & Andrea,"Kevin & Esther's apartment is very nice and clean. A wonderful place where to stay in San Francisco very close to the beach as wells as to the MUNI and bus stops. It's really perfect to stay there since you don't have any parking trouble (you can easily find a free parking spot in the street) and you can reach very quickly the city center and the Pier. Free wi-fi is also a great plus.
Both Kevin and Esther are really easy-going friendly and helpful. I think we could hardly find a better place in SF so we highly recommend it to anybody is going to plan a trip in San Francisco and in the Bay area."
2927781,488274478,2019-07-14,6041160,Eileen,I had a wonderful stay at Charles and Rene's home. The apartment is gorgeous clean and well appointed. The room itself is comfortable and bright big bed with everything you need for your stay. Nice bathroom and shower! Charles and Rene were lovely hosts super easy going and great to communicate with. Good location to explore the Mission. Thanks and maybe see you again next time!!

10251,2510305,2012-10-05,2682558,Kerstin,Wohnung war wie beschrieben alles bestens. Das 2. Schlafzimmer allerdings sehr klein und eigentlich nur für eine Person geeignet.
14426130,406195710,2019-01-28,192923171,Maria,I stayed at David's place for one night and it was a very nice experience. The place is stylish clean quiet and stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The location is conveniently located near Ocean Beach and Golden Gate park and there are several good restaurants and cafes nearby. I loved meeting David's dog Desmo and enjoyed chatting with David. I would stay here again!
6662231,113024878,2016-11-09,84487669,Robert,Great place to stay in SF on a budget. A little noisy at night (particularly the weekends) but not a big deal if you're the out-late type. I couldn't find shampoo but towels were provided. I would stay here again next time I find myself in SF.
746079,11863244,2014-04-17,98708,Inna,"The place is just perfect. It is really comfortable spacious and clean!! Private bathroom and separate entrance is a huge plus.  Ian is a great host and TJ is a well behaved and quiet dog.
Great location with easy access to transportation.
100% recommended!

19437156,170128107,2017-07-14,37130586,Ofer,"We had a great time staying at Whitney’s beautiful house. 
I highly recommend it. "
10788469,367846356,2019-01-05,189615520,Eric,"Modern and cosy skyhouse with an amazing view on SF and the bay.
It felt like home for 6 nights.
Worth the spend :)"
1932019,213369828,2017-11-20,137128238,Mary,Martha's place is lovely clean and snacks were even provided.  The only downside is that the TV did not have cable and Netflix could not be accessed due to connectivity speed.
2105840,195286053,2017-09-18,66723898,Jyoti,Claudia's place is fantastic. They were so warm and hospitable. I would highly recommend staying here not just for the location and access to things around the city but also cause Claudia and her husband were fantastic hosts!
9110718,338178000,2018-10-18,105707245,Alex,The house was great and suited 8 of us well. Virginia and Brian were both helpful and accommodating when it came to dropping off luggage early and picking it up later on the day of check-out. The house is absolutely huge and even with 8 of us it still felt incredibly spacious! Be aware that if you like to sleep in the pitch black then the master front bedroom isn't for you as there aren't any thick curtains just thin blinds - the size and comfort of the bed made up for it though!
3759368,172079322,2017-07-19,75360719,韋青,Leo人非常好各個設備的使用說明也寫得很清楚房間乾淨舒服下次來舊金山還會選擇這裡｡
16556338,250970645,2018-04-06,42343361,Albert,For this being my first overnight stay in San Francisco I was impressed with the views and overall chill homely vibes that I had while staying overnight at Hub's. The small walk out to the deck just to take in the awesome views of the city made my stay even better than I thought. The roominess of the space and the bed were on point just for me as a solo traveler. I enjoyed having access to the kitchen and the entertainment center during my stay. The neighborhood is not far from a selection of restaurants on Lower Mission which is a perk for me!
24357954,366956606,2019-01-03,148924818,Caroline,"Paul really is the host with the most! From the off he was so helpful and considerate giving us handy tips and  pointers ensuring everything would be perfect for our stay! 
While we were there he would check in to see if we needed anything and just kept in touch as a local friend and guide should we need it! 
My husband was an Airbnb skeptic but after such awesome treatment and a wonderful stay in Paul’s gorgeous home he is converted! Thank you Paul for a wonderful experience in San Fran and we will definitely be back!"
2356554,229067416,2018-01-21,16072050,Andy,"The host:
Tatiana is friendly and very fast at responding to our messages. Even though I didn't meet her in person she made sure my needs are met.

The home:
The instructions to enter are easy to follow and I had no problem entering the Airbnb. Street parking was bountiful and you are close to a grocery store. The location is only a short Uber/Lyft drive or a ten-minute walk to the nearest public transportation system. The place itself is nice clean and perfect for 2-3 people. It had all the right kitchenware to cook and the bathroom was clean and fully stocked.  

I would highly recommend staying here if you want to visit San Francisco!"
4519757,243152207,2018-03-14,153973158,Sisco,Friendliest most convenient hostel in town tons of free activities and food. The night life is on point too

8859249,106038441,2016-10-03,41970002,Kelli,Gary and Ericka's place is amazing!! What a fabulous place and fabulous Hosts!!! They gave great ideas helped out with some travel things we couldn't pack. We had the pleasure of meeting them both briefly but basically had the space to ourselves and contact numbers if needed. 
568161,12350098,2014-04-29,9709695,Jenny,I had a short but lovely stay at Beth and Don's home.  :)  The room was super cute and comfortable (the bed was so soft!) and the whole house was really clean.  Everyone was very helpful and supplied me with the little things that I had forgotten (an umbrella a shower cap etc.).  The location was also perfect - not ten minutes away from the airport by BART and the house itself a short 4-5 minute walk to the station.  Despite my short stay Beth and Don did their best to make me feel at home and spent a while getting to know me which I really appreciated.  It felt like staying at an Aunt and Uncle's house.  :)  Also their dogs were the sweetest friendliest things ever.  Thank you!!  
13901641,137809573,2017-03-17,51933818,Colleen,Very friendly and accommodating hosts. Would definitely stay again!

Good communication from Eugene & Paul."
32049077,494163821,2019-07-23,173702556,Crystal,Great location! Beautiful and clean home. Bed was not super comfortable but we really only needed a quick 4 hour sleep before our flight out in the morning. Really overall it was a very clean and beautiful place to stay right in the middle of fisherman’s wharf and the airport. Worked perfect for us. Thanks!
413663,6394146,2013-08-11,6925072,Pierre,"Hôte très accueillant et sympathique. Appartement confortable propre et bien situé. Quartier calme sécuritaire et près de la 27th St avec son atmosphère chaleureuse. On sent comme de vrai habitants de San Francisco. On le recommande et on y retournerait avec plaisir!

Very welcoming and friendly host. Comfortable clean and well located. Quiet safe and near the 27th St with its warm atmosphere. It feels like real people of San Francisco. We recommend it and would stay here again!

37530698,544300889,2019-10-09,141177321,Angelika,"Everything was great!!!
Claudia’s apartment is decorated with so much love it was super clean and if we had some question and asked through DM Claudia responded very fast. We enjoyed the stay in this lovely room and recommend it to others."
1985338,238964327,2018-02-27,29811334,Linda,"This very stylish ""studio apartment"" is very well-kept with lovely amenities and is in a great location if you are visiting Bernal Heights. It is right off Cortland Street and very convenient to very good food.It is quiet and private.
I was completely happy there."
17543814,191014974,2017-09-05,30437332,Alex,Jonathan is a very nice host. Although I did not have a chance to meet him this time he still tries his best to make the bed arrangement before checked-in. The location is very convenient and you can find some restaurants around the house.
16043093,270311579,2018-05-28,28998966,Gary,"Stacy’s place is beautiful immaculately clean and so well equipped with amenities. We had a 6 month old with us and she had all the things we needed and more (pack’n’play booster seat umbrella stroller even a bottle drying rack!) 
We also had access to her back garden which was lovely to sit in on a sunny day. 
She was a great host leaving multiple ways for us to contact her and she was quick at responding. 
The area is super quiet about 10-15 minutes in an Uber to all the action. 
It is a short walk to Lands End China Beach and Golden Gate Park."
284117,307630714,2018-08-14,42937831,Melissa,The location is fantastic- near a Muni stop as well as the highway so easy access to downtown as well as the airport. The cottage is a bit older and dated but the bed is super comfortable and the area is nice and quiet. A great ‘home-base’ for exploring the region.
20399118,365800466,2019-01-01,164065374,Sophia,"Helen was a fantastic host! Checking in and out was very easy and she was very warm and welcoming. The building as a whole was very cozy and clean and even though other rooms were occupied by other guests the room maintained a great sense of privacy.
The kitchen and common space is all fully updated so if you were to cook or lounge outside the room there was ample room to do so.
Overall the visit was great and I plan on booking Helen again for my next San Francisco trip :)"
7327920,421558909,2019-03-09,4789501,Alaina,"This place is spectacular. It's beautiful inside with an amazing view of the city. Pictures can't do it justice.

I'm a former Airbnb host myself so I really respect those who are excellent hosts. There were so many nice little touches that Katie put together from wine and cheese to a hand-written note. And her daughter provided some of her hand-made granola which I strongly suggest you try!

Located on a quiet side street the place is spacious on the lower floor of their home with a porch that opens onto a hill that overlooks the back deck. It's stylish without being pretentious and has everything you need including things you might not know you need. It's an open concept with a king bed and giant couch.

I was especially impressed by how well the kitchen is equipped. I loved having my coffee in the morning looking out over the city.

I will definitely stay here again. It far exceeded my expectations. Katie (and her space) deserve all of the extra time I put into this review. Thanks for a great stay!"
25919871,435529501,2019-04-10,152548457,Florian,We had a good stay at Vickys appartement. Unfortunately it was quiet loud (freeway and airplanes). The neighborhood is safe and Vicky was very suportive on occuring issues.
14220594,198005196,2017-09-27,129849259,Ozzy,Joseph's place is great an incredible value and he's an ideal host - totally prepared with instant communication. Would definitely stay again.
30469161,512949773,2019-08-18,263485094,Alex,"Apartamento acogedor y muy limpio. La puerta del apartamento no tiene llave para poder cerrar todo y que el acceso sea independiente. Entre la puerta garaje y acceso apartamento tendría que haber una llave. 
La ubicación es lejana del downtown. Zona tranquila. 
El desplazamiento mejor en vehículo. Transporte público un poco alejado y calles con mucho desnivel (algo normal también en la ciudad). 
Por parte de la anfitriona muy atenta en todo momento y amable. Todas las indicaciones las hace mediante mensajes. En ningún momento la conocimos en persona."
3780418,469008505,2019-06-13,104576435,Jacquelyn,Very clean and private space. Easy and fast communication with the host. Has everything you could need including a fully stocked fridge and lots of local recommendations. Very convenient location to explore SF!
16086843,306527855,2018-08-12,55180681,Minoru,Awesome location as it's right in the center of Union Square. They let us leave our luggage there before check-in/after check-out when we still wanted to explore the city but didn't want to carry around all our stuff.
3416013,24060483,2014-12-18,23305938,Colene,Emily made a special trip to welcome us to her lovely home. She was gracious about letting us use her wonderful kitchen for quick meals before our other obligations. We enjoyed meeting her and loved staying in her home with views of San Francisco. 
12657863,481974831,2019-07-05,123132483,Flamingo,very good house very clean nearby the beach far from the downtown and famous viewpoint easy to park.
1408281,133466888,2017-02-22,24786988,Nathan,I had a blast at the Queen of the Castro with Ashish and Kenny. If you're looking for a quiet bland and predictable SF experience this may not be the place for you. However if you want to immerse yourself in the colourful Castro get to know some wonderful hosts and feel like a San Fran local – this is your property. The futon was super comfy with easy access to a bathroom. Although it's not a private room as such there is enough privacy to feel like you have your own space. Oh and the view is ridiculous. Thanks for a fantastic stay gentlemen!
4902855,307627975,2018-08-14,102098907,Judith,Very nice room in San Fran!

3376895,213372499,2017-11-20,138982139,Ryan,Great location! Close to work for me and my dog and I slept like rocks. Great dog walking and running locations nearby as well.
6494663,245291491,2018-03-21,63658508,Steven,Great spot in San Francisco if you don't mind sharing a space. Paul's place provided just about anything you could ask for from a shared space.
17444964,555553007,2019-10-27,13412592,Bradley,Cozy great place in a awesome part of the city. Very welcoming and Karen and her husband made it feel like home
9150693,502530954,2019-08-04,230048392,Matteo,"This apartment has an excellent location in North Beach easily accessible by walk to Fidi Chinatown Embarcadero and Telegraph Hill. 
There are no other points of great value other than the location. 

The rooms are very small with a shared bathroom kitchen and common space that does not even include a TV. These common areas and kitchen are NOT kept clean and are unacceptable for an Airbnb listing. Additionally basic amenities and cooking tools are not included in the apartment (cups glasses etc.) as well as bathroom supplies. On top of all of this the room is located directly above a pizza store that leaves a weird smell in the entire apartment.

I had to contact the host multiple times to have the apartment cleaned. Additionally for an entire day I was left with my belongings including sheets and towels left in a locked laundry room without a response. The sleeping conditions that night were unacceptable. 

Disappointed especially given the price and encourage better customer service in the future."
15132100,128153466,2017-01-22,29282375,Dhaval,It was great
84777,472641,2011-08-24,939808,Marianne,My husband and I visited San Francisco for the first time and this was a wonderful place to stay!! John was great host and also a very kind person. We didn't carry our laptop so it was very useful that we could use anytime a laptop that was in our bedroom. The suite is in a separate floor so it is very private and comfortable. Nice and safe neighborhood a little far from some tourist attractions but you have access to pubic transportation such as bus #33 and N line. Love the cafés in Cole Valley a couple of blocks down the hill :) 
20695687,438887361,2019-04-17,19410651,David,Tyler's home is beautiful and he has done a wonderful job creating private spaces in a communal environment. My mom needed a place to stay in our neighborhood and she raved about the attention to detail and the afternoon light.
287907,2197625,2012-09-04,985280,Hunter,Great Communication by Adrian perfect place with perfect price to stay in SF thank you!
32088425,435887573,2019-04-11,212627291,伟,房子位置相当不错 临近市中心 开车去金门大桥25分钟 去市内其他景点也都在半小时内 房子设施齐全 干净整洁 情侣 三口之家 或者4个人都没问题 附近生活便利 非常安静 值得推荐
7068804,255199200,2018-04-19,162716345,Paul,The place is in a nice neighborhood a short driving distance to San Fran.  House is well kept and very clean.  Sally and Dan are great and thoughtful.  A very pleasant experience.
1578597,403546277,2019-01-21,43040681,聪,The place is nice cozy and very convenient. It's on top of the Potrero Hill thus have a very good view. The hill is steep so better travel by car. The host is very responsive and helpful. The only drawback is that the walls and ceiling are quite thin and you can hear others talking and watching TV. Because the host is so nice I feel guilty when I cancelled the reservation because of the noise.
900393,9267171,2013-12-17,12983,Althea,"The apt was perfect- four family members and my grandson who is 8 mos. stayed for 3 nights. A crib and some toys were left for him to play with. 
The neighborhood is quiet and we never had a problem with parking.
I highly recommend this apt.

32702921,424413691,2019-03-16,25333084,Kevin,Sabrina was a wonderful host and the space was beautiful and super clean. The location was amazing and the neighborhood is very quiet and safe. Sabrina would check in with me during my trip and had welcome snacks which was really thoughtful. I highly recommend this place!
21623314,464928779,2019-06-06,143532000,Martha,It was very clean and centrally located. In a safe area. I would definitely stay with Eric again.

6335352,250973633,2018-04-06,3846341,Lawrence,Vladi is a great host and the place is so spacious that's enough to have 6 to 8 ppl under one roof. The garden is so nice and you can see that there was a lot of time put into it. The location is great very close to Market Street and there are many grocery stores close by. Would definitely wanna go back if I am to travel again with a group
29798868,428308537,2019-03-24,10070066,Eric,Fadi was an amazing host! He was extremely thoughtful and quick to respond. His place was in a great location - short walk to restaurants and coffee shops short Uber to many main attractions. The home was clean modern and well appointed. Full size washer and dryer were in the unit. The check-in and check-out was modern fast and easy. Fadi was very thorough in explaining everything you needed to know. We appreciated and enjoyed our stay.
19331975,329789925,2018-09-29,6951044,Katia,Spencer was a thoughtful hospitable friendly host. He has literally thought of everything that would make for a comfortable stay while making it private and feel like your own place. 5 mins walk to the train 15 mins to the city - absolutely perfect.
9110718,88755809,2016-07-25,2967486,Porter,Gorgeous home with a gracious host. Would absolutely rent this for large family groups next time they're in the city.
10930490,63569803,2016-02-24,32528110,Dan,"I had a great stay and would recommend Devanshu apartment. It is easy to get to from SFO and easy to get into SF. Great e-mail communications almost instant replies. The bed is nice but it is a standard size not a problem for me as I was alone. Also this apt is located in the garage you need to pass thru the garage to get to the apt once inside all is fine. Good water pressure and lots of hot water.
Thanks."
4833101,40746721,2015-08-02,31537719,Selina,"Mike thoughtfully contacted me to let me know he wouldn't be around when I arrived at the house and he had made arrangements for his friend to welcome me.  After a long journey the house room and company was just what I needed.  My stay was sadly only for one night but I felt as though I'd known both Felipe and Mike for a long time.  
Mike thanks for all the local travel tips and letting me keep my bag at your place whilst I went sight seeing for the day! "
20857268,245533599,2018-03-22,46000909,Ali,Stephen's place is beautiful stylish and very convenient.

Overall wonderful experience. "

Walking distance to Corona Heights - a hidden gem - to see the city skyline of SF and to Castro. Bus stop is just right in front of the house!

Jeff went the extra mile by providing snacks and beverages. Appreciate the mini fridge in the wardrobe which is very useful.

All in all a pleasant experience. Highly recommended especially for first timer."

9716652,185497091,2017-08-21,51179511,Minh,This over 100 year-old hotel is located conveniently close to Union Square and BART Powell station. Expect the noisy atmosphere in this area though. Although it's an Airbnb it's in hotel style so there were clean towels toiletries and bathrobes for guests. Host was flexible fast communication and friendly. We were give some souvenirs when we left. For the price it's worth it.

I have been taking a coding bootcamp in the downtown area and this residence turned out to be the perfect setup for me.

After long days of exploring the city this was a perfect place to come ""home"" to.  It was a bonus to have parking and not have to drive around looking for a space.  We would defiantly stay here the next time in San Francisco. "
25094,267493438,2018-05-21,173716094,Reed,My wife and I stayed with Bruce and Alfredo on our trip to San Francisco from May 15-21 2018 to visit our daughter. This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was an excellent experience at their beautiful home. Their hospitality and their kindness was amazing. They made us feel like it was our home away from home. Everything was extremely comfortable i.e. the bed comforter the soft towels  right down to all the amenities. If we can rate them a 10+ we would. We look forward to staying with them again when we return to San Francisco.  We strongly recommend staying with Bruce & Alfredo. You won’t be disappointed. Thank you again Bruce and Alfredo!!  Reed & Marilou
1995487,78882798,2016-06-09,28637626,Liz,A stylish comfy oasis in an authentic vibrant neighbourhood. Close to all sites but off the tourist track for sure. Michael was an ideal host-- great communication before no problems arriving friendly and available if needed.  The wine for a rooftop aperitif was a lovely touch.  A perfect spot to feel like a local in one of SF's coolest neighbourhoods.

Es ist traumhaft liebevoll eingerichtet mit einem mit Weisswein Bier und Wasser gefüllten Kühlschrank und bis ins Detail gestyltem Interieur.Auch die Terrasse läd geradezu zum Verweilen ein.Selbst die schon sehr schöne Ankündigung im Netz wurde noch übertroffen. Michael und Matthew sind zwei unglaublich liebenswerte Gastgeber die mit ihrer dezent freundlichen Art uns mit wertvollen Tipps versorgt haben und auch dank ihrer Hilfe uns den Aufenthalt in SF so angenehm wie möglich gestaltet haben.Einen lieben Dank an Michael und Matthew von Ulla und Thomas

4718531,48072347,2015-09-23,38188893,Olivia,This was my first time using Airbnb so I am am delighted to say that everything went perfect. Mike is a friendly and accommodating host who is willing to offer suggestions of places to visit and restaurants many of which are in walking distance. He is also pretty flexible when it comes to check in and check out which I greatly appreciated. The house is just as beautiful as the pictures show and despite its central location the noise level was not an issue. Also his dog Willie is a total sweetie.

The walking neighborhood was clean safe fresh full of good shopping and a great grocery store. We arrived at the apartment to be greeted by Veronica & Family they helped us up to the apartment and left us with all the instructions for a seamless stay.

It was just as comfortable as home and we couldn’t have been more excited to find this gem.  We will definitely be back!

32160209,556872799,2019-10-30,296110627,Karim,"Une magnifique maison certes un peu excentrée du centre de San Francisco mais le bus 14 ou 49 étant à peine 3 minutes à pied ce n'est pas trop un problème! Les prestations sont d'un niveau professionnel le tout parfaitement propre et particulièrement bien décoré ! L'ensemble est tout automatisé (les clés codes d'accès aux chambres code wifi/Netflix...). Plusieurs chambres indépendantes dans cette belle maison donc où chaque hôte fera sa petite vie avec une grande cuisine (toute équipée) commune. L'ensemble des équipements est de qualité (robinetterie literie wc thermostat ...) et l'on s'y sent tout de suite très bien bien ! Camille et son mari ne vivent pas dans cette maison mais Camille étant très réactive elle vous répondra par téléphone ou mail dans les secondes qui suivent ! 
Seul petit bémol mais ça Camille n'y est pour rien ce sont parfois certains hôtes qui peuvent être bruyant ou sans égard à la vie en communauté (Et pourtant Camille y a mis les formes en inscrivant certaines règles de bon sens dans l'entrée).

Bref une très belle expérience que je réitèrerais si je ne revenais à San Francisco !"
8456859,132403792,2017-02-17,46033966,David & C'Anna,We had a wonderful five night stay at Joshua's place in the outer Richmond district. It was very quiet and after a busy day in the bustling city it only took a smooth bus ride to return to our little haven for night. We took at least three different buses (the 31 18 and 5) and were able to get wherever we wanted to go and the bus stops were very close to Joshua's home. The basement studio was open and bright very clean and efficiently yet very comfortably furnished. The big room had a kitchen big table desk area chair and sofa comfortable bed with a large closet and a big (Website hidden by Airbnb) on two sides let in a lot of light and the third side was all windows and glass doors to the sweet little back yard with a fire pit and flowers. We were able to park in front of Joshua's house the entire week (free parking!) and never used our car once.  It was a private experience - we met Lizzie briefly and she gave us a vase for our flowers but never met Joshua. However they live upstairs and were there if we needed anything. They provided clear directions and suggestions in a booklet. Since we know San Francisco and knew what we wanted to do we didn't need advice but they provided a great book of suggestions for out of towners. The location has the advantage of being only a few blocks from Ocean Beach and the amazing Lands End hikes. We found some good neighborhood restaurants nearby although we most often ate in other sections of the city and occasionally at home.  A great place. Yes we would stay at Joshua's place again.

21298993,320402229,2018-09-08,20558353,Claudia,We enjoyed our stay at Eddies place very much. It is perfectly located to start sightseeing. There is a cable car stop directly outside the building. We would stay there again.

24000340,361542844,2018-12-23,5814335,Daniel,This place was as advertised in the pictures and map location. But what isn't seen in the pictures is the intense smell of cat pee in the common areas! Luckily the bedroom smells much better once you close the door.
13815533,182518426,2017-08-14,22549488,Robert,My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay!  Doug and Trish are fantastic hosts who were very gracious with a last minute request.  The apartment was better than advertised and we'd be thrilled to stay there again any time we're in San Francisco!

The place is very quaint and cozy full of everything you need from a full kitchen to even a zen yoga room with a tv and cable. Milena was the sweetest and caring host as well. She always checked up on what we needed and made sure we were stocked with dish washing soap paper towels body wash etc. She even got us an awesome new set of pots and pans.  Location is walkable to lands end and to the 38 bus on geary street. Thanks for everything Milena!!  Our 2.5 month stay was very pleasant and comfortable to say the least!!
23004935,559766597,2019-11-04,65008187,Dmitry,This place is amazing it is unusual memorable and very cozy. The location on the legendary street adds charm to the Red Victorian. I would advise you to consider the RV not just as accommodation but as experience. But remember this is really a bit of a quirky place without gloss and pompous polished beauty. If you're ok with that - highly recommend!
8474183,362637081,2018-12-26,109472928,Lara,Jonathan’s place is great. It’s simple but cosy clean and has all everything you need. The bed is super comfy. The place is a little out from the city but super easy by car and Jonathan offers a parking place which is amazing in SF! The tv lets you sign into Netflix and sofa v comfy for chilling. We stayed over Christmas and it was a lovely place to have a special day with a yummy cooked meal and relaxing in front of the TV later. In fact Jonathan actually joined us for dinner which was very nice. He’s in biotech so had lots to talk about with my bf who’s studying biology. The neighbourhood is cute and has everything you need like shops and restaurants. The streets are pretty and colourful. The place offers you some peace away from the hectic city. Jonathan is super communicative with lots of advice.   We ended up staying an extra night :) would recommend!
971116,407303026,2019-02-01,90241594,Edward,Everything about it was a bit better than I expected. Very good location in a nice neighborhood. The host was almost instantly responsive to a couple of minor questions. Room was large enough to be comfortable and had amenities that made it feel like it was my own place. Both the host and his partner were polite and tolerant of my brief rants in other words real gentlemen. Would recommend this to anyone who wants a nice central location in a nice home.
8739,6750538,2013-08-24,5451383,Erica,"Ivan and Wendy's place is a fantastic little oasis in the beating heart of San Fran's Mission District. We absolutely adored our stay in SF and Ivan and Wendy's easy going hospitality paired with their amazingly relaxing and comfortable home made our stay even more memorable. Everything was as promised and more.

Great proximity to authentic Latino eats the Mission's thriving cultural enclave and the subway with direct links to SFO Airports. Highly recommend! (thanks again I & W)."

I was amazed and very grateful as we had just landed at SFO when I sent my email.  We were pleasantly surprised when we for to the room.  It was spotless the beds were wonderful and a great location.  
The front desk staff were so helpful and professional - very impressive!

The communication prior to our arrival and throughout our stay was perfect. The neighborhood is great with many nice restaurants bars and small shops.
The room was amazing as well. It is very spacious lovely decorated and perfectly clean. It could not be any better.

The accommodation was perfect in every way and beyond our expectations.   Jane was a perfect host very welcoming and gave us good tips on the local area and how to get the most out of our stay.  The local area is excellent for getting around and seeing the sights and in easy walking distance to good restaurants and the local culture. 

 We absolutely recommend this as a perfect place to stay and if we ever return to San Francisco we couldn’t imagine staying anywhere else!

1356817,61668996,2016-02-07,2207622,Noah,"The apartment was spacious  clean and easily accessible.  The room was large with a comfortable bed and large desk.  The neighborhood is fringe and the entrance is on a side alley Street  but I never felt uncomfortable.  Alex is a gracious host  very helpful and responsive.  Perhaps it was my misunderstanding but Alex stayed in the apartment upstairs during my stay.  He was a ghost and I never saw him other than my check in.  Great spot  if you need a place to stay and don't mind a ""roommate"" it is a fantastic option."
24723,136910665,2017-03-12,74866494,Emily,What an amazing apartment! Clean comfortable perfect size for two or more. Cozy bed and nice amenities. Private and no disturbances ever. Wifi always worked. Awesome location especially near Fillmore. Walked almost everywhere. Uber's/Lyfts were always around. Delicious restaurants within walking distance. Never had any problems. Lacked some natural light but not a big deal. Especially if you're out and about a lot! I would definitely stay again. Very nice hosts.

22110217,326647543,2018-09-22,46868894,Dirk Und Bianca,Leila‘s Apartment ist wirklich liebevoll und sehr gemütlich eingerichtet. Fast wie ein kleines californisches Beachhouse ;) Wir haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Es ist alles da was man für einen Aufenthalt benötigt. Hervorheben möchte ich die sehr bequemen Betten die tollen Badezimmer und die Snacks in der Kitchenette. Der Kontakt mit Leila war zu jeder Zeit super obwohl sie selbst auf Hochzeitsreise war. Es gab aber zwei Personen vor Ort die wir jederzeit hätten kontaktieren können. Besser geht Airbnb nicht ! Herzlichen Dank Leila das es diesen schönen Ort gibt !!!
22396902,363465292,2018-12-28,213421479,Zach,Great location Stephen and Brian were very nice and the room was beautiful.

14705126,150701590,2017-05-08,86990173,Khaja,"If I could give Anna 6 stars I would. The lengths she goes to make the stay a comfortable and happy one for the guests is extraordinary. She has lots of snacks water bottles fruit juices fresh packs of tooth brush and paste and several other little things that make you feel welcome and eliminate many travel inconveniences.
We were tired after a long drive and it felt like heaven to have some coconut water and limeade to get the blood flowing again.
Adrian was considerate and helped carry luggage up.   
The coup de grace was this: I forgot my cufflinks and asked Anna where I might buy a pair. She sent me address and directions to three places within 10 minute drive. Macy's and Nordstrom Rack being among them.  Then she offered to let me use a fresh shirt and cufflinks from her husband.  
This is someone who cares about being an exceptionally good host.
Bravo Anna!
And thank you for everything.  
Oh expect to get tons of messages on travel and shopping suggestions and multiple prompt responses to any questions. "

27316423,336869273,2018-10-14,9281825,Michaela,Easy check-in and quick responses from the host.  It was nice that we had a spot in front of the house since we could not find street parking.  Thanks for everything.
41172,23916635,2014-12-14,1487318,Barbara,Sue was very warm and welcoming. She had her refrigerator well stocked with bread eggs yogurt milk fruit and delicious gourmet coffee. Her home is charming and the views from both the first floor deck well manicured yard and guest bedroom magnificent. The guest quarters on the second floor is very private and comfortable and has its own new private bath. So you felt that you had your own private apartment. Sue has a gem of a place within a couple of blocks from a variety of casual as well as fine dining and friendly coffee shops. You will not be disappointed!
56621,6007221,2013-07-26,250966,Mirjam,Jay was a very kind host very helpful and always very fast responding. The room just looks like on the picture really sweet.

2046807,201138132,2017-10-07,25032723,Mélanie,Kevin is a wonderful host who made sure we felt at home and had everything we needed all along our stay (great communication too). We spent a week at his place and had a blast. The listing is accurate the little inside garden is definitely a plus and the neighbourhood is full of great place to eat/enjoy a glass. Would definitely recommend! Thanks again Kevin!
4718531,25376879,2015-01-13,1859419,Michael,What a wonderful authentic San Francisco home! Michael is very welcoming and the house is beautiful! I feel fortunate to have been able to stay in a place with so much history and one that has really not been changed as so many places are. Michael plays the Grand piano and sings beautifully. The furnishing and artwork are amazing. The giant claw foot tub with brass fixtures and surround shower curtain was a fun experience. Water bottle and glass in the room extra towels and nice soaps are thoughtful touches. The bed was supremely comfortable and plenty warm. The ceilings are so high! Love the chandeliers and the authentic Victorian wallpaper! Simply amazing! The parlor is used for plays Italian language lessons and other events on occasion. Michael said the house is often used by TV shows for the authenticity of the home and its furnishing. I feel so fortunate to have stayed here and hope to again! Thank you Michael!

8739,67076,2010-07-21,105365,Jillian,"Great location friendly people. We enjoyed our stay!

A note: the bathroom is not ""en suite"" but a few steps down the hallway. We were fine with this but it might be worth noting.

59702,22430679,2014-11-06,790445,Mike,"Toby and Joe welcomed Caitlin and I to their home like friends they'd known for years. We spent both of our nights there chatting listening to their stories about Crete living in San Francisco hosting on Airbnb and growing up on the East Coast. Even though we were visiting from within San Francisco a ""staycation"" we didn't know much about Bernal Heights; Toby and Joe told us about all their favorite spots and people. We left Bernal feeling like we'd truly lived there for a couple nights.

Toby and Joe are the reason Caitlin and I stay in Airbnb listings. They have more than a bed to sleep in; they have stories wisdom kindness and unending hospitality. "
499096,2062875,2012-08-22,473617,Elettra,"I stayed with my partner at Ingrid's studio for 3 days. We didn't meet Ingrid as she was in Europe but we met her daughter Anna. She was very nice and gave us a lot of tips on resto/bars and attractions in the area.
The studio is really nice and cozy and if you get a nice sunny day the small garden in front is just heaven :-)
There is a small fridge a coffe machine and a microwave so we could make ourself breakfast in the morning and a coffee when popping back at the studio for a break before heading out again - the area Mission/Dolores being so teeming with places to see and resto/cafès! We really enjoyed staying at the studio is well connected with the street cable to the waterfront and all the other major sightseeing areas it's in a quiet and residential street yet a stone throw away from so many cafès taquerias and more hip resto. 
If we'll have the occasion I think we'll definitely stay there again next time in SF! 
Thank you Ingrid and Anna :-)"

87640,15331632,2014-07-07,16261815,Meadow,Karin is a terrific hostess! She made contact before my stay to confirm arrival times and check-in information and when she couldn't be there in person to welcome us she texted several times throughout our stay to be sure that all was going smoothly. Our room was clean and beautiful amenities were very thorough and convenient and the garden was so gorgeous. I highly recommend booking this comfy private garden room for your San Francisco stay!
8328410,111549326,2016-10-31,15850513,MichaelDavid,Rubin's Apartment was very clean well-kept true to the photo's provided and the view at night was amazing. I was in town for work and the professionalism of Rubin and his assistant ensured that I was able to get a great nights sleep and be close to where my project was located. They were both flexible with my arrival despite the inclemency of the weather and available around the clock should I have needed them.  If you're looking for something central to the city while being walking distance from any regular shopping I highly recommend a stay at Rubin's Lower Nob Hill Apartment.
1995487,27259903,2015-03-01,5426012,Daniel,Amazing living experience fantastic decoration and friendly environment to stay. Definitely will come again

1998111,12945474,2014-05-15,2209678,Neeraj,I booked this place for my parents Kenix was a very pleasing host right from the beginning she was always there for any help with the place. The place itself was very clean and nicely maintained. Everyday there were new people to meet in the common area which was great way to meet travelers. the bathrooms are not attached to your bedroom and shared by everyone in the house which may be a deterrent for some people otherwise great experience! I would love to come back and stay here.
1535946,27510093,2015-03-06,223899,Henric,Great and cozy place. Enjoyed my stay very much and would book this place again! 
1043282,78323707,2016-06-06,20729050,Daniel,Our experience at John's place (while short) was absolutely amazing. We only stayed for one night but it was exactly what we were looking for. A comfortable styled house that was easy to get to and from. We went up to SF for the beginning of the AIDS/Lifecycle which John was so extremely kind as to even drive us to the kick off at 4 in the morning! He was very informative on how to get into the place if he wasn't there and was so caring in making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.
4022990,324262743,2018-09-16,70739426,Alexandra,This place was great! Enough room for 4 people. It’s a perfect area bcuz it’s close to everything. My friends and I took Uber everywhere and it wasn’t too expensive. Front desk people are so nice as well.
2578122,213551702,2017-11-21,2015947,Milena,Brian's place was much better than expected! He is by far the best host I had on Airbnb he made me feel truly at home in his apartment. There are 2 rooms for guests with s shared bathroom. I was a bit concerned about the shared bathroom but was amazed at how smooth the experience was. The place is squeaky clean all the times and you have access to an amazing living room/ kitchen great internet connection and a super helpful host. There are a lots of beautiful touches in the room and  bathroom like a computer charger or awesome accessories. Also the neighborhood is amazing half a block from a muni (tram) stop and close to some of the best cafes and restaurants in San Francisco. Cannot recommend this place enough!
2042095,36508471,2015-06-29,28749338,Scott,Both Lawrence and Bruce are very nice person. The house is extremely clean and stylish. The view from the room is really beautiful.  Car is easy to park and everyone is easy to access bart to go anywhere. Btw the dog  Bert is such a quite and clever boy. He leads every guest to the room and ready to be your friend. I love him.
4135201,193732056,2017-09-14,11823342,Bentley,"David’s place was very clean and just like the post states. Him and his roommates were very kind and super welcoming to me when I arrived until I checked out.
I would definitely recommend David’s place to anyone who wants a clean and comfortable stay in the beautiful city of San Francisco. If you do not like hills this place might not be for you I felt like I lost 10lbs with all the walking I did up and down hill to/from his place.
Thanks for a great stay!"
1724819,45087393,2015-08-31,36747734,Jennifer,The house and view were absolutely gorgeous. Neighborhood was quiet. Natasha was very helpful to myself and my friends who were newbies to her wonderful city. Would highly recommend staying at her place when visiting SF. 
3486460,45053349,2015-08-31,27415011,Cordula,We felt at home at Emily's house from the very beginning of our stay. We found everything we needed in our room and the kitchen. Emily and the other guest were so inviting to us that we did not feel like guest and tourists but like friends and locals. Emily is helpful if you need help and sensitive if you like to be on your own. We loved her company at least as much as all the magnificant things we've seen in SF. Everybody who would like to experience the city and a wonderful inhabitant cannot stay anywhere else than at Emily's house!
1984709,157847723,2017-06-04,4563545,Skye,Robby was a wonderful host.  The apartment is clean welcoming and cozy.  I appreciated Robby's communication tips on dining and assistance.  Would stay here again!

14220594,172399468,2017-07-20,50528774,Fouad,Nice place. Had everything I needed then some. Location is close to downtown but neighborhood leaves something to be wanted.
2925557,16549097,2014-07-29,12827860,David,"Arthur kept in touch to make sure everything was ok and that we were making the most of our stay in his apartment and in SF.
The apartment was immaculate and an excellent place to stay in a great location. Arthur's book on restaurants bars cafe's etc how to get around was priceless.
I hope we get back to SF soon because now we know exactly who to contact as a super host and where to stay!
Thanks for making us feel so welcome Arthur."
17585947,495902167,2019-07-26,4139923,Brandon,"Probably my favorite Airbnb to stay in. 

These two are so amazing! The space is relaxing healing and beautifully laid out. Not to mention all the amenities and thoughtful touches. 
Also it's so close to the water and a bunch of amazing things to do. 

10/10 would recommend."
2123469,436743551,2019-04-13,27212272,Jonas,Had a great time. Everything worked smoothly and i enjoyed it a lot. Thank you so much!
4663060,136433241,2017-03-10,1395031,David,This is a great apartment in a lovely (and quiet) little neighborhood in SF! Mark was a superb host: communicative accommodating and friendly – our stay at his place honestly couldn't have been any smoother. Highly recommended!
17343208,315796283,2018-08-29,3702173,Paula,"I could not have asked for a better experience here. Dave was so helpful and inviting. The other residents are also authentic; just being themselves. We talked a lot about the Red Victorian and living in community. The place has a hippie vibe but it's *clean* – so great since I consider myself a ""clean hippie"". Bed was comfy bathroom was great; check-in & out seamless with the codes you're given. 

Something I didn't realize about the Red Victorian – you'll save a ton on food so factor that in to your cost. There's a huge amount of food you are able to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner. Dinners Sunday - Thursday are prepared for you and free! Laundry is also free.

If you're looking for an authentic San Francisco experience stay at the Red Victorian."
545685,173692072,2017-07-23,69179847,Hassan,Very clean and equipped studio apartment. Having a bar sink fridge and big bathroom were nice perks. So much more than simply a room. Easy access.

21964157,243965500,2018-03-17,108509589,Rodrigo,Wings place is awesome! It’s cozy and comfortable while Wing herself is amazing. She is extremely nice and a great host. She offered many stayed in contact frequently and gave many tips on how to do things around San Fran. She even made my friends and I a Chinese desert! It was a great experience at Wings Place!
12088624,180507120,2017-08-10,84621837,Jake,We enjoyed our stay at Trish's place and we're happy that Trish was able to help us quickly with some issues that arose during the 3 months we were there like the pilot light on the water heater being out. Our main issue was that the unit was not clean when we arrived and generally had low quality furnishings. Multiple pieces of furniture were broken upon arrival such as one chair in the dining room a bedside table upstairs and a chair on the balcony. We were missing a sheet on one of the beds and other sheets were torn. There is also other wear in the unit like a ripped carpet in the loft. Overall this place needs a bit of TLC but the good news is the owner and property manager seem to know and are interested in improving (for example by changing cleaners). One thing that would have been useful to know before we booked is that there is only one set of building keys so if multiple people will stay in the unit some of them will have to carry garage door openers around to get back in.
32378158,448060544,2019-05-04,146166520,Jamie,Great location for the Golden Gate Bridge and park with easy bus ride to the city centre and in a quiet neighbourhood.  Overall a reasonable stay but we have made some suggestions to the host for future customers.

17606766,157864424,2017-06-04,122524404,元正,The house is very old and seems half renovated. There was a weird odor in the double-bed room.

191632,37566939,2015-07-08,33320516,Emily,I stayed with my friend at Maria's garden cottage and it was our first shot at airbnb. Such a good experience with Maria and the website in general! Maria was very helpful and reached out to us to check how we were doing throughout our stay. That was very thoughtful and appreciated as opposed to waiting for us to ask questions first. The room itself was very comfortable and the perfect place for us to come back to after a long day of walking around San Francisco.
13669721,408845902,2019-02-05,6824634,Monica,The place is great and the host are nice and caring :)
14762607,456902092,2019-05-22,44875165,Sarah,My husband and I stayed at Ryan's place for 4 nights while I attended a conference at the Moscone Center.  The apartment is a one bedroom with great separation between the living and sleeping spaces.  Though located in a busy part of SF the apartment was amazingly quiet.  There are all the creature comforts needed including a great TV and sound system really luscious towels a kitchen with dishwasher and great fridge.  There are all the things needed to cook a gourmet meal but there are so many good restaurants within a mile radius it's hard to eat in.  The kitchen is well stocked with things like sugar salt ketchup EVOO coffee tea to make life easier.  I also liked the gas stove heater which worked well and was pleasant to look at!  Ryan gave us a number of personal recommendations to find things we wanted and was available to help with questions about how to work some things in the apt.  He left great instructions.  This is a great place to stay in SoMa and soooo much better than a hotel room!

5394755,71542252,2016-04-26,3772852,David,We felt very welcome.  I used to live in SF but never spent much time in the Mission District.  It's an exciting place and their house is a great springboard for exploring.  They also had lots of suggestions for things to do.  I enjoyed talking with them about school issues since that is a passion of mine.  
7987618,93369042,2016-08-12,85828638,Stephen,I stayed here for 11 nights.  It was like being at home.  The property was fantastic - pool hot tub fitness center.  The apartment itself was also great - full access to kitchen and laundry.  It's well situated to Muni with a fair hike to Bart.  Neighborhood is great for exploring.  Dhruv was an excellent host now a friend.

The amenities such as the washroom and shower are super easy to use. The area is also super safe and literally just minutes away from the Golden Gate park and the Golden Gate bridge as well. Also you can't go wrong with the food options around here. If I come back to SF this is definitely the place I wanna stay again.

The flat is really cozy and although it is ""shared"" with the Pilates Studio it does not bother at all as Cathie is really respectful and you should be visiting the city anyway :) chestnut St is amazing: lots of restaurants and markets."

Ihr Haus liegt an einem Hügel mit einem sehr steilen Gefälle will nicht übertreiben denke so 25 GRAD. hat zwei süße Kinder die sehr zuvorkommend waren und die Katzen waren sehr liebenswert. Das Haus war sehr Sauber. Würde wieder  kommen.
150848,77983909,2016-06-04,38446619,Brian,A wonderful neighbourhood a beautiful house and the most delightful host made this stay one to remember! Nancy is a charming attentive and witty host. She made us feel so welcome offering many useful tips on the excellent local restaurants and breakfast choices. Her house truly is a haven and sitting in the garden after a day out in San Francisco's downtown was the most relaxing way to unwind. The courtesy breakfast one the first morning the coffee freshly made each morning even the choices of the toiletries were all just right for us. Perhaps the simplest way to say thank you is to say it was a shame our stay was only three nights. Nancy many thanks for making our first Airbnb stay one that we will remember with great affection.
1336998,26471152,2015-02-13,4491503,Alexander,Great hosts. Great house. Great cats. It was a perfect experience and I would stay here again for sure.
1043282,166765430,2017-07-04,118092294,Joann,"John is a great host and his home is very welcoming with many amenities like a cell phone for local use guidebooks to the city robes tickets to the MOMA. The neighborhood is great; it was quiet at night but it's just a short walk to many restaurants and bars. We really made use of the location. I highly recommend staying with John.

28518540,337574219,2018-10-16,11344006,Naomi,Michael’s San Francisco flat was AMAZING! Perfect for my small family. Clean convenient and a fun space! He communicated quickly and efficiently also being flexible with our check in time. We will definitely seek out Michael’s Noe Valley SF apartment for future travels.
28841178,558193520,2019-11-02,129925485,Michelle,This space was exactly as advertised. Clean spacious a fantastic location. I would stay here again.

Their place is well located clean and comfortable and they were very welcoming and friendly during our stay - we would definitely recommend their apartment to anyone looking to spend some time in San Francisco!
14386727,177441853,2017-08-02,23924750,Julien,Good time there !! Slept very well 
23973022,410847370,2019-02-10,114905509,Jennifer,Great house & very clean! Beautiful views! Would stay here again if I return to San Francisco.
23223838,524347248,2019-09-05,6377752,Frances,Andria was very welcoming she greeted us upon arrival. The small space was quaint and clean with a beautiful outdoor garden. You have access to a microwave and espresso machine I suggest taking sugar and creamer (also ice no fridge in the unit) as that’s not provided.   We had coffee while sitting in the two small chairs provided the coffee table is small enough to hold 2 cups of coffee.  I would also recommend taking an iron if needed. There’s not really a place to put your luggage we had the suitcase on the floor between the door and a chair and walked over it to sit down. I would recommend taking a duffle type suitcase that you can leave in the closet. We felt safe the entire time the code accessed entrance was great however the room you’ll stay in does not allow to be locked when you leave for the day.  Even though the door didn’t lock we felt that our things would be safe while in Andria’s care.  She is fast at responding to messages and for the price it’s a good value.

1460628,131603094,2017-02-12,65550627,Alexander,Great location in SF - you're in walking distance of many grt areas and still nice and quiet. Condo is well equipped and nice with garden. Does feel a bit like living in a bunker but good value still. 
12741695,234683865,2018-02-13,90881482,Melissa,David & Desmo’s place is a gem. It walks a beautiful balance of being clean and contemporary yet cozy and warm.  Super green to top it all off. Wish I had spent more time there there’s an impressive book collection too! Speaks volumes about their hosts. :) Looking forward to the opportunity to be back.

2203283,477740805,2019-06-28,63657018,Xiaowen,Super clean. Super welcoming. Super quiet. Not disturbing at all. The apartment is close to many Korean and Chinese restaurants. Close to grocery. There's a street full with Chinese restaurants and bakeries. Quiet and safe neighborhood.

Kaleen was always warm and pleasant to deal with.  She was also very prompt about getting back to us when we had questions. She left us food and snacks along with maps brochures etc.  Couldn't have been nicer!"
11674758,300640620,2018-08-02,36447248,Maxime,The apartment was very nice clean and we felt at home. It is ideally located in Mission at a walking distance from both Castro and SoMa.

8356380,178047504,2017-08-04,92082076,Fred,Zeer aan te bevelen. Mooie grote schone kamer comfortabel bed en badkamer met goede douchekop. Openbaar vervoer op loopafstand. 
8287266,233475266,2018-02-09,1552645,Robert,Spent 6 nights in February. The room is exactly as described and as in the photographs - clean stylish comfortable and quiet in a very good location - close to public transport. Alex and Daniel have really thought about everything for their guests - access was very easy and the room felt very private - I didn't actually see any of the other residents at all during my stay. The only thing i would point out is that the room gets almost no natural light. The window looks out onto a wall and it was necessary to have the lights on all the time. The advantage to being at the side/back of the house however is that it is quieter. San Francisco is such an incredible city that i imagine most people visiting will not be spending that much time in the room!
12511163,168604547,2017-07-09,45185801,Amanda,Philip and Pam were very nice. They were very accommodating on my 3 days stay in SF. There are a lot of public transports nearby so it is pretty easy to travel around. The beach is also very near. Thanks Philip.

488297,333774491,2018-10-07,36574050,Karen,If you are looking for a place to stay in San Francisco that is in a quiet area has amazing views is super clean and comes with parking - this is your place!  We just completed a girls' trip to the City and Craig's place was perfect.  It was comfortably furnished had 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a beautiful kitchen not to mention a balcony with fabulous views of downtown.  We will definitely come back!

20425693,256422764,2018-04-22,14830583,Andrey,"Unfortunately I coulnd't visit the place myself but my friend and colleague successfully visited Toni's house. 
Apratment is in the same house where Toni lives but with a separate entrance. The neighbourhood is safe and peaceful. Two parks are nearby. 
The main purpose was to visit the conference (Moscone Center) so the location was perfect.
Absolutely recommend the place both for a short business trips and for family stay."

2047469,20900046,2014-10-07,19464958,Eric,Kenix was absolutely the best host we could have asked for. She was so welcoming and kept the space clean and friendly and more! Honestly we were so very surprised and impressed by the atmosphere she created for her guests from the adorable decor to the thoughtful use of the kitchen space and being absolutely accommodating even when our plane arrived late. The location was great super close to all of our grocery needs (and wonderful fresh produce stands nearby too!) We would recommend Kenix in a heartbeat to any AirBNB'er visiting San Francisco.  Thanks so much for having us!

Everything about the apartment is great including the location. Just one advise: if you are planning to go by car  try to arrive during the day bcz at night  parkings nearby  the apartment are busy."
2315086,402845863,2019-01-19,141969141,家仪,We enjoyed our stay at Ron's home. He is a wonderful host. If we come back to San Fransisco we’ll definitely choose Ron’s house again. And I’ll miss his friendly dog—Quincy! We’d like to thank Ron again for making our journey in San Fransisco an indelible memory! He provided us with useful information and a house that can be called HOME indeed!
256148,2788890,2012-11-02,3983264,Rachelle,"Chris' apartment was amazing--super convenient location (the Castro Muni stop is 3-4 blocks away) lots of restaurants and cafes within walking distance and the ammenities... she thinks of everything. You don't just get a clean tidy room; you get fluffy towels (body bath and hand) soap shampoo lotion shaving cream (toiletries for both men AND women) Q-tips cotton balls razors and coffee/tea cereal bars full use of the kitchen and living space. Oh and street parking is a breeze. I brought my F-150 Super Crew and didn't ever have a problem finding a spot. This place is truly a home away from home. We stayed for three days and regretted not planning for a longer stay.

Chris herself is super cool. We loved talking to her when we got a chance; smart funny kind and she knows a lot about the city. She thinks of everything for your stay. There's numerous maps city guides and SF related books in the room. She has two cats who aren't allowed in the room (they usually stick to her room or her bathroom) but they are friendly too. If they like you enough and you like them you may get a chance to pet the only cat in the world built like Hulk (the oh-so-meaty Roger). 

All in all we had a great time and thanks to Chris we didn't at all feel lost or like tourists on the edge. This is an awesome place to stay. We wholeheartedly recommend Chris' place.  "

I wasn't able to meet her as she was away but did enjoy having the place to myself.
She always responded quickly if I needed anything. Her friend was there at times to take care of her lovely cat and check if I needed anything. 

The provided coffee and granola was very much appreciated! Lots of nice little touches. 

The area is awesome right in the heart of the Summer of Love area of SF and so close to Golden Gate Park. Loved it! Beautiful comfy room too! Exactly what I needed. 


Thanks Siobhann <3 
Jamie."
1931763,200264754,2017-10-04,6151302,Annette,Matthew's place is conveniently located clean and quiet. We enjoyed staying there for four nights and highly recommend this room for up to four guests. Even the fact that the bathroom is a shared does not disturb as Matthew is seldom around.
38327380,539145749,2019-09-30,111919647,J,Ive been here for a couples of days. Given the price i would say it is an good choice to stay. 6person dorm is a bit crowed. Around are lots of restaurants. Specially recommand Swan oyster depot the most famous seadfood restaurants just 5min walk distance away(but always long long queue).
4287481,54104644,2015-11-16,41566043,Ali,Rumesha's place was a great place to stay while we explored San Francisco for a couple days. Rumesha's father greeted us when we arrived. He was very friendly and gave us a full tour of how everything worked. We loved all the little touches like leaving a couple snacks for us and the blackboard with all the information we could possibly have needed. While the area isn't super central it felt very safe and was only a $15–$20 Uber ride every morning to get us started (and we always enjoyed the drive through the park!). We didn't find the bed to be too comfy but everything else about the place more than made up for it. 
10469182,140978164,2017-04-01,46689561,New,Great location for Uber or rental car.  Near Golden Gate park and Veterans Hospital.

17812931,440402695,2019-04-20,27747159,Hanna,Marie was an amazing host and we loved listening to her stories during the delicious breakfasts (don't miss it!) Her home is lovely and comfortable!
12981814,427075157,2019-03-22,14389664,Diego,"The Opera Inn was a good place to stay close to SF downtown and very comfortable. Rooms are cleaned everyday same as in a hotel and the staff is friendly and helpful.
The only downside was the room I was assigned: it was on top of the hotel restaurant so while the restaurant was open you could hear ambient music constantly.
I usually left the room early in the morning and came back late at night so it wasn’t too bad.
Overall I had a very pleasant stay I would totally come back"
2172308,52211933,2015-10-27,8869140,Marie,La localisation géographique est un must : situe à moins de 2 minutes de  Fillmore street la maison est idéalement placée ( quartier vivant et commerçant transports publics disponibles ambiance sécurisante etc.). Les photos sont représentatives du logement et l'agencement autorise 2 couples à partager la maison - une troisième petite chambre d'enfant permet d'accueillir une autre personne ( mais de petite taille) sur un matelas gonflable. Les hôtes avaient préparé un guide d'utilisation de la maison et un descriptif du quartier. Le minimum nécessaire était disponible dans le frigo pour une arrivée tardive. Les hôtes ont été disponibles pour répondre à nos questions. Nous étions 5 adultes réunis dans la maison pour une réunion de famille et le logement à participé grandement au succès de notre séjour à San Francisco. Nous n'hésiterions pas à retourner dans ce logement si l'occasion se présentait. 
3594786,38670908,2015-07-17,5762099,Josephmark,I travel to SF quite a lot and have stayed at a number of Airbnb and hotels. Staying at Insiya's place was fantastic – I will be here again. Not only is her place large comfortable and in the best location; but Insiya is a wonderful person to be around. Would recommend to anyone!

9197404,152069293,2017-05-14,20836381,Hannah,Its was great to stay at Shanad house.  Fantastic location to buzzing neighbourhood. We felt very at home and Shana gave us great tips for ojr trip. 
106025,1162396,2012-04-22,637539,Sandy,"Annette's apartment is gorgeous! The place is elegantly decorated with rain shower in the master bathroom. The queen bed is soft and comfortable and there is also a sofa bed if there are 3 travellers.
There is also a washer and dryer which is convenient instead of going to a laundromat down the street. There is also a beautiful kitchen for people who want to cook at home and the fridge was stocked with juice/snacks when we arrived. Although it was near a somewhat ghetto area I felt perfectly safe and it is close to Union Square and the cable cars! Annette was also quick in responding any questions I had and the place had free WI-fi as well. Definitely better than a hotel!"
16824774,291402152,2018-07-15,11593624,Anne-Marie,Lovely space away from the downtown  hustle and bustle. Great contact with Penelope and Sven and their cat Boris.

1304808,21463002,2014-10-18,9617697,Jackie,The apartment was as described and pictured. The bathroom (shower toilet sink tile) is modern updated and clean. House manuals are all helpful and easy  to understand. Lots of natural light throughout apartment and the location can't be beat!
4607177,107841965,2016-10-12,76219405,Justin,"Everything was as advertised. The apartment was a in fun neighborhood and an easy walk to everything. The place was very clean had good amenities and quiet. 

Lindsay was a great host. She communicated a few times to make sure our trip was going well and there were no issues. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in a fun neighborhood and get a real feel of San Francisco!"
23946104,403392991,2019-01-20,80951577,Maureen,What a gem!  This air bnb is cleverly designed to make use of the small space and is spotlessly clean. The bed and pillows are so comfortable - like a warm hug. Marie is a very responsive and helpful host.  This is a great location right by USF.  We took long walks around the neighborhood every night and always felt safe.  We will always stay at this bnb during our future trips to SF if it is available.
25229521,350176388,2018-11-18,134884927,Kathi,Minimalist clean accommodation for two.  Noisy
5547500,404349028,2019-01-23,143991548,Fulden,All we have to say is simply amazing! Jason and Ryan’s place is the ultimate spot in SF with gorgeous views of the city . Great location - a short drive or comfortable walk away from the Castro. Jason was very helpful and responded to the many questions we had on the week leading up to our stay. Check in was a seamless process. Jason had thought about everything with additional thoughtful touches and the house was spotless clean. We felt very comfortable during our stay and would definitely return. Highly recommend!
23147212,423632090,2019-03-14,146301938,Vitor,The Marcia house is in a very nice place of the city and with easy access to the main points of the city by public transport. The room and bathroom are great.
7973781,64493558,2016-03-04,523648,Rune,Carl was a great host and his house fully lived up to my expectations during my two-day stay. It looks exactly like the pictures was clean and equipped with nice amenities and a great kitchen. Carl was also able to accommodate both my booking on very short notice and communication was overall smooth. This was a great value and I'd recommend it (particularly for families).
680288,8036749,2013-10-14,4299666,Trevor,"Ken & Richard are fabulous hosts. They were very friendly and gave us heaps of information about San Francisco and the local area.
The apartment is extremely comfortable and very clean. Being so close to the Bart is great for travelling in and out of the city.
We would highly recommend a stay here."
918341,34282207,2015-06-07,19554268,Pauline,The Garden Getaway is a wonderful apartment with everything you could possibly need during your stay (coffee machine maps etc) The apartment itself is spacious spotlessly clean and stylish. Kepa is a great host and the garden is absolutely stunning ! We really enjoyed breakfast at Plow (5 mins walk away) and had a great meal and cocktails at Serpentine restaurant. The neighbourhood is friendly with transport links downtown. Overall we loved the Garden Getaway and we will stay again should we return to San Francisco. Thanks Kepa!
680288,524361036,2019-09-05,116131074,Jessica,Very informative helpful hosts. Beautiful space!
15343159,343471512,2018-10-31,189660606,Nathan,Michelle provides a good room. Not the warmest welcome but everything we needed. Would recommend for travelers who need a place to stay for good price.
32577104,491150005,2019-07-19,140304203,Sung,Very clean. Close to everywhere in city. Got to see and experience many things though of one day stay

La ubicación es muy recomendable."
2518781,106057378,2016-10-04,1815446,Nathaniel,Cute apartment in Bernal Heights area. Christopher was super helpful and was really accommodating he was around for most of our stay and when he was away for the day it was really easy to get him by text/call. He had a lot of recco's for the area and steered us in the right direction. The only issue in the area (and all of SF it seems) is that parking is a bit tricky. We had a car for one day and had a lot of trouble finding somewhere to put it. Otherwise great stay in a cool little area.
3093543,236659737,2018-02-19,166404345,David,"Wonderful place. Great hosts. Great location. Only bummer was no TV. WiFi was iffy and the place wasn’t really “chill” friendly. That is the only place to kick back comfortably was on the bed. 
     Still we had an awesome time."
4882295,52675170,2015-11-01,37497422,Renata,"Michael and Vernon are great hosts the smell of coffee in the morning was a warm welcome to a new Day in San Francisco.
Love the location not to far from the city center but in a great neighborhood to have dinner with lots of restaurants to choose from.
The room was perfect bed and linen makes you feel like in a 5 star hotel and the towels are amazing!
I recommend to everyone who wants to feel at home and at the same time have the comfort of a 5 star rest.
Thank you once again Michael and Vernon we loved your place and your hospitality.

1774026,110517059,2016-10-26,7511012,Catharine,"We had a great stay at Cedric's place.  Cedric was very responsive and helpful during our stay (he even bought sweet stuffed animals for our 2-year old to take home!).  The place is spacious and very kid-friendly--our daughter loved our ""trip house.""  The condo is a bit more ""worn in"" in places than we expecited but that did not change our wonderful experience!"
7949668,142125377,2017-04-06,40737030,Management,Very clean. Very nice. Evening parking is quite easy.  I would stay here again in the future. Great view!

22548614,544649350,2019-10-10,11468860,María,La habitación en la casa de Judy es perfecta para conocer San Francisco. Una habitación amplia con baño privado en una casa con mucho encanto. Además en un barrio muy chulo y cerca de un montón de restaurantes y bares aunque en una calle tranquila. Por otro lado muy bien comunicada con metro y tranvía. En definitiva un sitio muy recomendable.
13845578,407332610,2019-02-01,79704234,John,Lance’s place was great. A stylish clean affordable alternative to a hotel room and in a unique neighborhood and a funky outdoor space with a hot tub. We had to leave a day early but Lance was very understanding and communication was fast and easy. Would definitely stay again.
4269254,42860595,2015-08-16,35391497,Hallie,We had a great time in SF and loved staying at this home. Marjorie was most helpful and informative about getting around and using public transportation . It was very easy and we didn't feel far from all the city attractions. The accommodation was comfortable and very nice. I would stay there again and recommend it to friends and family. Thanks so much.

The room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. Nathan is friendly provides clear and precise directions for use of the amenities and is quick to respond to any queries.

Definitely recommended!"
18785944,288421790,2018-07-09,76161041,Ashley,Beautiful home and wonderful hosts! Location is a 10 and comfort is a 10. We really enjoyed our stay here ☺️
10385321,312094763,2018-08-22,185592249,Caden,Robert's place was clean and the place was very prepared from top to bottom. He provides a list of simple to follow rules along with tips around the area that helped a lot when we decided what to do for dinner one night. Very comfy beds too. I highly encourage anyone to stay at Robert's place if you are stopping in San Francisco. 
2016198,268703237,2018-05-25,178041344,Ciara,Great place! We really enjoyed the snacks for mornings and the bikes to get around the neighborhood. The bikes made it easier to get to places as we did not have a car and walking to the shops was long. We loved how cozy the place was and how we could see the ocean from our bed.
1336798,8082528,2013-10-15,7962774,Jeremiah,"My family (8 people 3 generations) stayed in this home for five nights. It was a great place all around. Great location in SF.  There was plenty of room for everyone. Having two living room areas was very convenient for our group. The backyard was ideal for the kids and great for getting fresh air anytime. The kitchen was well stocked for home cooked meals. Communication with the owner was easy and Judith was very attentive in addressing a few detailed needs relating to babies. 
I would recommend this home to anyone! "
3325741,28324394,2015-03-22,27913571,Trey,"Robert was a great host! He's very friendly provided everything you'd need for a weekend stay and extremely helpful. If you're having hard time/bad day (like I was) he's definitely a great person to talk to.

The room was just as advertised - plenty of space great tv/internet plenty of toiletries and in a great area. My favorite part of the house was the natural lighting and open feel. He has two adorable dogs that stay in the kitchen or master bedroom but they are very friendly when they come out to play! 

Overall I'd highly recommend Robert as an AirBnB host/place to stay and will definitely stay again!"
330535,16394204,2014-07-27,13558532,Mariuca,"Lovely flat in a nice and quiet street we found everything we needed for our stay. 
Its location was ideal for discovering San Francisco: Haight-Ashbury Golden Gate Park Castro or the Painted Ladies all in walking distance. Ryan was very helpful and answered all our questions prior and during our stay.
We recommend this flat to anyone willing to get a taste of locals’ life in San Francisco. 
"
4614763,52517832,2015-10-30,46011519,Patrick,Del was very welcoming and helpful before during and for my departure.  She was able to accommodate a later than usual check in time and had a lot of recommendations for the local area and rest of the city.  The room was clean and comfortable.  A+ service all around.
13021568,174697916,2017-07-26,65932715,Erin,Peihong's place is very spacious with a huge room and private bathroom. Peihong is a fantastic host and opened her heart and home to us so warmly. She offered us a drink and food when we arrived and breakfast in the morning. Her kind spirit made us feel so welcome and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and would come here again. Thank you Peihong for a fantastic stay!
18904,228229075,2018-01-18,4502849,Peter,Perfekst beliggenhed i meget dejligt område. Stille og fredelig lejlighed Flot køkken. Værelset er lidt lille til 2 personer med kufferter. Men SF i januar er koldt og fugtigt.

23611,68135985,2016-04-02,281238,Angela,I had an absolutely wonderful stay with Gina. Her condo is beautiful. Absolutely stunning views of the city. The room was cosy and very comfortable. A great space for working - a desk in front of nice big windows.  I enjoyed a run on Bernal Hill every morning with gorgeous flowers and views of the GG bridge and East Bay...all a block away from her space! I also found the parking on her street to be easy during my stay. 
9587361,438827166,2019-04-17,72130477,Sarah,Well worth staying here! Great location and really good value for our family of five (4 adults one 14 year old)

3664261,156891647,2017-06-01,83871147,Sharon,Max's flat is clean warm comfortable and cosy. Max was a considerate friendly host who really helped us out when needed like driving us to the supermarket late one evening. The area is very quiet. We could hear Max and his dog Henry in the mornings as they woke but I could tell Max was being super considerate and the quiet morning noises were shortlived and not at all an issue. To note that it is a steep hill back to the flat from public transport. This was fine for us but something to consider. Uber was reasonable fast and convenient. Definitely recommend Max and his flat!

2518781,552925098,2019-10-22,586132,George,Lovely apartment thoughtfully supplied in the kitchen with a comfy bed with quality linen & towels. The location is exactly as described a 15 minute bus trip to downtown and not a touristic area or perfect. Very close to a supermarket and lots of great restaurants. Thanks for a great stay!
24463,656196,2011-10-23,927977,Marlene,Cathryn was a terrrific hostess!  I'm moving to San Francisco and she was very helpful telling me all about different neighborhoods.  Her place is beautiful!  What a view!  Clean comfortable and inviting.  Thanks Cathryn for a great stay.
1130628,43857315,2015-08-22,41386947,Anni,Es war genau angegeben wie wir an die Schlüssel kommen und Zutritt zum Zimmer erhalten. Einen persönlichen Kontakt gab es allerdings nicht. Zimmer und Bad waren gut auch wenn etwas älter als auf den Bildern zu erkennen. Die Lage ist perfekt. In einem der spannendsten Vierteln von San Francisco. Wir würden wieder dort übernachten!
24723,210300772,2017-11-08,147225740,John,I would definitely come back and stay. The place is absolutely beautiful and spacious. Cynthia and her husband are so welcoming they both made it so easy for my first airbnb trip.  I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting SF and or needing a close place to downtown SF.
7514742,45599844,2015-09-04,41590090,Bing,The suite we lived is very comfortable. John contacted with us many times before we arrived telling us about the suite asking for our time to arrive suggesting the way of transportation. He prepared many good things for us especially sodas for my son and local wines etc. Upon our arrival he introduced very clearly about the suite the things he prepared the attractions of the city and the menu of breakfast. He prepared breakfast every morning. We leaved at 7:00 in the morning two days later and he prepared the breakfast before 6:00 and called taxi for us. All in all John is very considerate warm friendly and hospitable and the suite is big and comfortable. The only pity is that we stayed there too short. Highly recommended!
14426130,523082728,2019-09-02,62300014,Jt,"A fantastic place in a perfect location with a wonderful host! 

Great local restaurants and vibe 2 blocks from the beautiful Golden Gate park 1 mile to the ocean.  Incredible value that can’t be beat!"
216064,2135578,2012-08-29,3121391,Jake,"There's no topping Angela period.  The house and room were beautiful well decorated and very clean.  Neighborhood was gorgeous and quiet at night.  The host herself is very bright in appearance and character.  The amenities that were provided went well above and beyond my wildest expectations.  For example: hot unique and delicious breakfast every morning; little notes taped around the house with instructions and tips; clean towels upon arrival; free internet access.

If you're considering staying in San Francisco make sure you book with Angela before anyone else! "
727866,10338319,2014-02-14,511667,Marie,Esther is absolutely one of the kindest most genuine and thoughtful host's that I have ever stayed with. Super easy and accommodating during the booking process and welcomed me with a huge hug when I arrived. It felt like I was visiting a friend! The studio is PERFECT. Immaculate beautifully decorated and has everything you need to be comfortable. Esther took the time to give me more than enough information and I quickly felt like a local. Public transit was close and easy to navigate the beach is just blocks away and I had peaceful night's sleep in this quiet and peaceful neighborhood. I hope to return and certainly plan to stay with Esther again. Thank you for everything Esther!
18286171,427455063,2019-03-23,27068420,Reyna,My flight was delayed and I was not arriving until 1:30 am. It was so comforting to know I wasn't keeping anyone awake because the self entry. I also had to request to book that day and was accepted. Very grateful for the accommodation and private nature of my stay. There is another room that was rented out next to me and I didn't hear anyone. It was very clean and has a comfortable bed. I walked to get coffee in the morning and then to the lake. Beautiful neighborhood and location!
4902365,174394016,2017-07-25,106074409,Taylor,Good hostel with planned activities for young travelers and some free dinners/breakfast. I met really nice people!
351978,1069247,2012-04-01,1592608,Brandon," After growing increasingly  bored with my hometown of Pasadena TX and wanting something more fast paced and exciting i made a literally 4hr decision to load  up my truck and move to san Francisco. It was the manifest destiny of brandon barrett lol.  I hadn't the slightest clue where i was going to stay or what i was going to do for money.  All i knew is i was willing to sleep in my truck until i found a job if thats what it took to live in the greatest city in the world.. so be it. Lucky for me i found maria's  on airbnb and that never ended up being an issue. after cruising Airbnb and many other sites i stumbled upon the trumbull house. I said to myself ""no way is this place is so affordable and doesn't have something really wrong there has to be a wall missing or a half of a roof or someting"" ha..but i decided to pay for a few days and find out what the  deli-o was.  I am now writing this review 4 months later from marias house and i couldn't be happier! i work a great job right down mission st(that i got from a contact staying in the house) I have made lifelong  friends from all walks of life and even countries! I have learned many interesting things about their cultures as they are always interested to know more about the american culture as well. If you stay long enough It even gets to the point where you are sad to see people go. Maria  throws parties for both houses each month where people from both houses get together and discuss the city give out tips about jobs where to find things cheap what is close by. Long fun story short..If you are looking to move to SF and make friends and memories that will last forever o even just experience the beautiful cultural melting pot that is S.F.  for a few days marias is the place to do so. 5 stars for clean comfortable living and memories that will never fade."
19180222,290096802,2018-07-13,121098425,Emma,This is a fantastic place to stay in SF. Great location and the apartment is amazing. The hosts are super friendly too. If we go back to SF we would stay here again.
10385321,137190922,2017-03-13,56857802,Max,Die Unterkunft von Robert war sehr modern und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Man hat sich auf Anhieb wohl gefühlt. Robert war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Parkmöglichkeiten gestalteten sich  sehr schwierig vor Ort allerdings nach langer Suche hatten wir doch immer Glück.
9188845,530495629,2019-09-15,92338152,Daniela,Chaz is an amazing host! He is accommodating and quick to answer to any requests questions concerns. His place is super clean and I lived the location. All of the instructions were easy to follow and clear. I recommend Chaz and his home 100%.

6387526,200830742,2017-10-06,6369119,Jack,The listing was extremely clean and very comfortable. I was there for work and Chris made checking in very easy for myself and my colleagues even though we arrived at different times. The location is awesome. I wld definitely stay here again.
4887587,102632950,2016-09-18,89008696,Erica,Nice clean hostel. Overall it was a good experience. Only issue i had was the level of noise outside the room. We had a private 2 bed facing the main street. It was loud at night as expected but we didnt expect so much noise in the morning. Staff were friendly and everything was well setup.

11474754,192069185,2017-09-09,50389200,Mike,"This is a fabulous home from home. The apartment is in immaculate condition and is a lovely place to stay if you are in San Francisco a few days. The apartment is in a great location in the near suburbs of the city close to amenities and public transport. The place really has a wow factor

Joyce was really helpful throughout especially with our later than planned arrival and was a great communicator. She left us great lists of things to do and places to eat which was above and beyond what we'd normally expect from a host."
11437509,165728577,2017-07-02,8153493,Melanie,This was a wonderful place to stay. Location was great and room was exactly what I was expecting. Maria is friendly and provided great suggestions.

1673011,513614878,2019-08-19,114212373,James,Fabulous house the 2 decks were lovely with stunning views of the city. Everything you need and the local area has great restaurants and the Tartine bakery is to die for-trust me it is well worth waiting in line. The convenience of the Muni J line tram is also great and takes you right down to the Ferry Building. Overall we had a fabulous time and would thoroughly recommend the house to anyone visiting San Francisco.

7715542,514728534,2019-08-21,186623221,Amanda,Michael was an excellent host! We arrived earlier than expected and he allowed us to drop off our bags. We had everything we needed in the apartment and we were even able to do our laundry before we left for our next adventure! The LOCATION is incredible - we walked everywhere! The apartment was a little smaller than the photos suggested and it could definitely use some updates but it was perfect for my husband and me. It was a great location Michael was awesome and most importantly it was clean!

3870174,446959543,2019-05-02,133800868,Rachelle,Jack and Jason's place is the perfect place to stay during a trip to San Francisco. It is the perfect location! Just a small walk to restaurants nearby and a quick bus ride away from the downtown area. Jack and Jason were very responsive and were very kind to meet in person. The room is furnished with many little touches such as hot tea coffee ear plugs makeup wipes etc. We could not have asked for a better stay. I highly recommend Jack and Jason's place!

I always got fast responses from them and they gave me clear directions from the process of checking in how to use the shower and checking out. I was even surprised with a welcome sign with my name! It was super sweet. The room exudes a warm and cozy feeling. Definitely a place you want to book!

1919372,93338890,2016-08-12,19443967,Marcy,We did not feel welcomed as we have at other Air BNB's but that's okay.  We loved the area very central I think the neighborhood is what the apartment has going for it.  The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows.

8102262,129700969,2017-02-01,68442091,Jourdán,Hal's place was very comfortable and  conveniently located near the MUNI. Hal was a very accommodation and communicative host.
22505200,522885089,2019-09-02,284898686,Tony,Amazing place in an incredible location! Quality stay in San Francisco!!!
1995487,24932338,2015-01-04,23200915,Sam,Host was very welcoming and accommodating as we had a late arrival he placed a lockbox in front of the door. The listing is as accurate as can be super clean and looks just as it does in the pictures. Great decor and vibe in his place and the neighborhood around. His place is located right next to a ton of food spots bars just everything. Me and my girlfriend were traveling throughout San Francisco and stayed at multiple places and this was by far our favorite due to the culmination of the room area and friendliness of our host.
3309722,66793074,2016-03-24,1220085,Ramy,The place was very much as described and had all the amenities plus a huge deck. Nice views as well. 
515430,114325347,2016-11-17,101937797,Tom,The cottage was absolutely perfect for our six day visit to San Francisco.  It was just as described: quiet clean private and comfortable.   It was just the right size for two of us and the location close to the Church Street light rail made commuting to the Financial District easy for meetings.  We also parked our bicycles on the front porch for touring the city on the weekend.   We heartily recommend this home to anyone as a top tier accommodation. 
4948327,101678617,2016-09-14,93792335,Guangsen,"We had a wonderful stay at Budi's. Budi is a very friendly host and we feel very welcomed. The room is also quite comfortable.
The place is very near to Golden gate bridge and the palace of fine arts. Moreover the most famous Chinese Sichuan restaurant (Chilli house) and all other Asian restaurants are just minute's walking! Will definitely recommend the place to other travellers.
"
18582383,192082777,2017-09-09,32236823,Dina,Robert and rodania have a great place.  It was spacious clean and easy to get to via transit.  We are big cooks so we enjoyed the open kitchen.  Only bit of constructive criticism would be that the kitchen itself is not generously equipped for making meals but I suspect we are a minority for not eating out or ordering in!!!!
22554459,281900123,2018-06-25,10642762,Florence,Amazing view on the city very quiet street yet very close to restaurants public transportation and grocery stores. Stephanie and her husband were really nice and gave us some advices for the rest of our trip. Their two dogs are very cute and our kids enjoyed them a lot.
15733592,125999145,2017-01-08,27318953,Elyse,"My husband and I spent five nights at Dave's and we can't wait to return.  His apartment is the most centrally-located apartment you could ask for (if you like North Beach and really who doesn't?)

It was sparkling clean modern and very welcoming.  The fireplace is very cozy and the entire apartment has a very relaxed chill vibe while at the same time having all the conveniences you could want/need.

We literally walked everywhere except when we explored the Sutro Baths since that's about ten miles away.  Also to our delight there's the cutest little coffee place just down the alley which is open 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily.  VERY convenient!

Dave was a perfect host very nice and accommodating and we both highly recommend this host and apartment.  Although not when we want to come back because WE want to stay there!  :)"
1768239,8034434,2013-10-13,9192162,Peter,"We had a fantastic stay at Deb and Gregs place. The best panoramic view ever and a very good location close to Castro and Cole. The flat was very clean and our host received ud with great warmnes.

4252808,79980765,2016-06-15,40332406,Anna,Great location!
213854,73729796,2016-05-09,64462940,Sarah,"My husband and I stayed in Lex's Airbnb after our apartment flooded and we required temporary accommodations. The Airbnb was as advertised clean spacious and good value for the size and neighborhood convenience factor compared to other Airbnbs I considered. Fully stocked kitchen equipment and lots of oils spices and misc. treasures in the communal cabinet. Additionally Lex is an incredibly responsive host who followed up with all of inquires nearly instantaneously. When the internet stopped working he came over immediately to address the problem.

I will say that the house is in need of a few repairs (the windows in the front don't close and let in a lot of cold air and noise to the living room); however this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment staying in the unit given the points above. I'm so happy it worked out to stay for 8 nights and would have stayed longer had it been available.
"
4616596,528279721,2019-09-12,1327986,Nora,Loved my time at Jennifer’s place. The location is fantastic the space has everything you’ll need AND it has a hot tub and cute backyard. It also comes with a very adorable cat from upstairs. Highly recommend!

The interior of the whole house is simply stunning - I can say I’ve never stayed in such a well thought-out place. The neighbourhood is also incredibly beautiful.
15705696,166315982,2017-07-03,94297126,Peter,The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

10477793,468985620,2019-06-13,74848189,Vince,We booked it for our 24th Wedding Anniversary.  We have 8 kids so this was a perfect getaway for a couple days.  No TV quiet clean and comfortable.  Easy walk to the train about 1 mile walk to the beach great food from variety of cultures.  About 45min - 1hr to anywhere by bus.  We went to Fisherman's Wharf rented bikes crossed Golden Gate took a ferry back rode a Street Car shopped ate and relaxed.  Next day went site seeing and walked the miles of ocean beach.  What a great stay.  Thanks Brian for your tips and hospitality.

The condo gave us plenty of room for a party of four.  The deck was lovely but the weather did not allow us much time to enjoy it."
11659435,124781129,2017-01-02,103609654,Duc,"The stay was great! My friends and I really enjoyed our time in SF and at this property. Loren was quick at responding and very accommodating. The property was clean and all the amenities inside the home were convenient and nice to have. 

We did not get to use the backyard/patio area as it seems to have been under renovation but it was cold while we were there so not sure we would have stayed out too long. Definitely would use in the warmer months. 

The home is older but very charming. Good neighborhood (location close to everything) but I wouldn't venture out too far as some areas closeby didn't seem too safe.

Would recommend.
Thanks! "
10043166,189703657,2017-09-02,42380502,Marc,In total the appartment was great. Really close to Haight Street with some cool restaurants and stuff. Only negative was the little dog smell around the house but great stay in total :)

Although I was traveling alone I was able to meet so many new people coming in and out of Zain and Duncan’s place. 
1206184,104191787,2016-09-25,25496600,David,Lovely stay one block away from Haight street. Sadly didn't meet the hosts but the room was clean and well furnished and the shared amenities more than adequate. communication was good access was easy. the location can't be beaten. Bed a tad hard room a little noisy but all guests and host were extremely respectful after 10 pm.
1171918,104206799,2016-09-25,95061867,Jacob,Alex was a great host! One of my guests arrived earlier than the rest of the group and Alex was able to accommodate by changing his schedule. The place was as advertised and if I were to visit SF again I would stay here again!
18757463,175791499,2017-07-29,1220928,Nathan,Our family of four had a wonderful stay in this home. Super clean and comfortable great location to all parts of the city and we enjoyed the quiet compared to other neighborhoods. Absolutely ideal for a family w/ two kids - the ability to play with all the toys and books was so fun for our girls so much so they thought it was their new home :) Thanks again Andreas & Family!
27510287,366541489,2019-01-02,13020688,Lauren,Hands down one of the best air bnb experiences. The hosts were amazing and responsive. The apartment was adorable and had amazing amenities for the small space—tea kettle coffee maker a bottle of wine and cheese! I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

2770561,124797108,2017-01-02,41099989,Jessica,This is a quiet sanctuary with close proximity to the city center while also providing the experience of the lesser known mission district. We enjoyed the unique furnishings and ridiculously comfortable bed provided in the space.     Our host held excellent communication  with us for the duration of our trip and provided everything possible for a pleasant and memorable stay. I would highly recommend the home. 
1989997,198534538,2017-09-29,26747984,Darren,Great place to stay for one person who wants to be close to everything and enjoys a little extra social time with the hosts.  Everything was just as expected from reading all the other reviews.  It was a great experience for my first time in San Francisco.
14029901,335305789,2018-10-11,185993200,Andrew,The space was very nice and tidy. Lance and Nils were very accommodating even with our last minute booking.
22998690,403430348,2019-01-20,6701232,Susan,What a beautiful house and a beautiful room! The location was perfect a surprisingly quiet block right near everything in the Mission. Lu's home is full of light and plants and art. The balcony is large (my San Francisco friends were envious!) and I made time to relax outside and enjoy the view.  I really appreciated the pitcher of water by the bed the space heater for chilly nights Lu's willingness to make me coffee every morning and her friendly guidance on local restaurants and the simplest transit routes. (Also I mentioned that I planned to visit the zoo and she magically conjured a complimentary ticket.)  It was a pleasure to stay with her and I would absolutely return.
14426130,182502761,2017-08-14,25716534,Kysa,Had the wonderful opportunity to stay at David's home during Outside Lands.

Er war nur selten da aber wir haben ihn 2 mal kurz getroffen und er war sehr nett und per Mail immer schnell zu erreichen. Das Zimmer ist wie beschrieben im unteren Teil des Hauses in dem Paul oben wohnt. Das Zimmer hat kein eigenes Schloß aber man hatte trotzdem genug Privatsphäre. Das Zimmer verfügt über ein eigenes Bad. Paul hat in seiner Küche ein paar Snacks für ein kleines Frühstück für seine Gäste parat.

The best choice stay in San Francisco."
10926639,186508522,2017-08-24,145024716,Michele,Erik was a wonderful host.  Very helpful and quick to answer any questions we had. Would not hesitate to recommend!
6045869,131556301,2017-02-12,113479420,Siri,Lovely  apartment. Wonderful neighborhood. All the amenities you could want. You will want to take care of the nice furnishings and art so may not be good for small children. 
1421774,23868290,2014-12-13,11610591,Sean,I loved Vanick and Deborah's home. A perfect place for me to unwind after working all day. I will for sure be trying to stay there next time I'm in town.
24777563,328991522,2018-09-27,29584448,Elena,buena ubicación al lado del golden Gate aparcamiento en la calle sin problemas y con el metro al lado para llegar al downtown en media hora. la verdad que un barrio tranquilo y residencial. Nos ha gustado alojarnos aquí la habitación muy amplia todo limpio y con menaje de cocina y algo de comida básica.
229240,30159205,2015-04-18,23565838,Jessica,A lovely clean place quiet and very friendly! A pain to get luggage up the many flights of stairs but the staff were there to offer help from the get-go. 
567239,423034308,2019-03-12,129043675,Alberta,Great hosts and (Website hidden by Airbnb) prepared for an outstanding view and a steep hill.

562593,12316188,2014-04-28,9242684,Adam,Matt's place in North Beach was the perfect location for our adventure in SF. It was an unplanned trip and we started to look for a place two days prior to arriving in SF. Matt quickly responded to my inquiry and questions about his place. Before the end of that evening we were booked and Matt arranged for someone to meet us at the apartment. Arrival was easy and the apartment was ready for us I enjoy. We didn't cook this time but Matt provides not only the fridge/cabinet space but the tools to do so. The apartment had a hip comfortable feel. We probably spent the majority of the time sitting on the couch next to the window talking. Views of the Golden Gate Bridge Coit Tower and the roof tops of North Beach were impressive. We never turned on the TV but he's got a big one. Matt was awesome enough to leave detailed instructions on internet/tech stuff. The bed was comfy!! I don't know after trekking the streets of SF made me so tired or it was the bed but I was definitely comfortable. Matt was definitely a great host and I would recommend his place to anyone looking.
7367530,42175949,2015-08-11,34979308,Jin,central location!
31447415,567514400,2019-11-22,21504925,Staci,Hua’s place was good for what we needed which was just a place to sleep for a few hours before going to a different Airbnb. However the beds were extremely uncomfortable. You could feel the slats on the bunk beds through the mattresses and the master bed felt like you were sleeping on a box spring. The showers were nice and the place is obviously new!
10926639,189148736,2017-08-31,56683609,Mick,Erik è un ottimo host preciso e disponibile! Stanza pulita e comoda!molto centrale e perfetta per visitare san francisco! Raccomandato!
16017966,408588740,2019-02-04,238838046,Matt,Fantastic. Check-in was a breeze and João is a great friendly accommodating host. Highly recommended.
1547477,29093302,2015-04-04,9980165,Phat,This place has a killing position since it is located right in the heart of Hayes Valley which is my favourite neighbourhood in San Francisco. But the most important thing is that Michael and his team are very considerate and responsive during my stay in the unit. I was lucky to stay there for 2 months and I strongly recommend this place for anyone visiting San Francisco.
27491792,456150930,2019-05-20,48442153,Ursula,This place is clean stylish and well located excellent choice if you are visiting SF
9494726,547694422,2019-10-15,141130544,Chris,I had a great time here. I booked a private room but went to the common area a few times to meet up with some travelers and for some fun events. Everyone was super friendly.
14934208,268695238,2018-05-25,4420859,Saurabh,Collin was a very responsive host and his place was great. The Harry Potter theme is very well done we loved it. The location is great - super close to everything downtown. The secure building / entrance / lock is appreciated. The overall space in the apt is on the tight side but Collin kept to himself for the most part so we got the run of the common areas. (He was available when needed Access was not a problem). The bunk beds were very fun and easily accommodated 3 could also do 4 in a pinch. The kitchen is well equipped the washer dryer are super useful (we traveled as a family and stayed for a week so needed it) and the TV nook with a big couch was very welcome. The shower etc is comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!
4890230,133963460,2017-02-25,32602553,Sergio,All very well except there are few bathrooms
3112427,522927706,2019-09-02,40227733,Courtney,My sister-in-law and I stayed for a long weekend and had a great time. It was plenty big for two people and the backyard was great perfect for a bottle of wine as the sun went down. (Also the chickens were an added bonus!) The location was perfect. Very close to Muni and there was an easy bus that took you straight downtown.  The space was exactly as pictured. Very clean and tidy and basic amenities were provided. We were able to walk to the grocery store and pick up some basic items for breakfast and store in the fridge. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to SF.
774323,50208767,2015-10-10,44591988,Michelle,The host! She was friendly and she had real thoughtful things for us to use such as a selfie stickphone chargersmapsslippers and shampoo. We loved the ceiling fan. The bathroom was very nice and had bath towels hung on a towel warmer. The place was comfortable and quiet. We loved the location to all the fun shops and food places right around the corner to the best bakery ever The Tartine. Delores park right by which is beautiful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it.
2355859,400050163,2019-01-10,103915182,Richard,Robert's place was in a great location.  Close to restaurants and a market.  The place was clean and all the amenities that I expected.  I would stay there again.
1069167,61425955,2016-02-04,52139729,Briauna,Had the best time staying with Bob and Jen. They have curated a great space that embodies the best parts of San Francisco. If I am ever in the area again I will definitely stay here again. Good people and a comfortable environment. 
12930338,547315251,2019-10-14,292194399,Abhi,Great place
14996188,108997502,2016-10-18,3326368,Elizabeth,Suzanne's place was exquisite. It was very pretty light filled and exactly as shown in the photos a great mix of comfort and style. The bed was one of the best I have slept in; I am a tricky sleeper at best so I really appreciated the extra black out blinds which could be swept open to a pleasant garden view in the mornings. As a visitor unfamiliar with the area I really appreciated how helpful Suzanne was in explaining how the streets were organized and how to best get around locally (including letting me know where I could find three yoga studios nearby). I was pleasantly surprized by the gorgeous little local village feel of the area and liked Suzanne's food and coffee recommendations too (Arizmendi Bakery is excellent). I also appreciated all the little extra touches she left in the suite including the best coffee I drank while I was in the U.S. (though 'The Beanery' down the road had some good coffee too and excellent bagels). A gorgeous stay overall I would go back in a heartbeat.
15051965,523930786,2019-09-04,40158361,Jeff,The apartment is in a great location and with the L-Taraval streetcar at the end of the block you can get anywhere in the city easily. It's foggy and cool in summer but that's normal in the Sunset District. Taraval Street has lots of restaurants and other amenities very nearby. The check in couldn't be easier with keys in a lockbox accessed by combination provided. The apartment is very large with a big living/dining area  and a large bedroom. There's a cafe table for anyone wanting to work and the wifi is strong. The apartment is appointed in very modern style with beautiful hardwood floors and the bathroom is not tiny and has a shower/tub combination. The hosts were quick with replies to questions. I had a great stay and overall the apartment was great and just what I needed.
5581254,78701783,2016-06-08,21964373,Nicolas,"Un très bon accueil et un séjour très agréable ! L'appartement est charmant avec deux belles salles de bains. Il est idéalement placé pour pouvoir visiter San Fransisco. Kesinee et son mari sont toujours disponibles pour répondre à nos questions et nos sollicitations.

Propre bien équipé et spacieux ce logement est idéal pour 4 personnes.

Merci !

8474183,428326756,2019-03-24,139927994,Kerwin,"Jonathan's place has everything we wanted including having a short walk to the Mission and other great eats. The sofa bed is surprisingly comfy.
Jonathan is a great host and responds super quickly if you need anything."
4718629,420495177,2019-03-06,213224499,Alexis,Best part is the location this place is soo close to the beach. Truly amazing.
16407735,519025903,2019-08-27,270378130,Antoniette,Servio’s is an amazing host.We we’re able to check in 4 hours before the check in time.The location is very safe and we enjoyed our stay.
9924449,348190269,2018-11-12,122514379,Agatha,This apartment is such a gem!!! The bedrooms are spacious high ceilings great light. Nice kitchen and bathroom. Just such an awesome space overall. And it’s in such a great location! Walking distance to fun cafes and bars. Already looking forward to staying here again next time we come back to SF.
2518781,11434888,2014-04-02,12861362,Barbara,What a treasure! Quiet convenient and extremely comfortable. I stayed for 2 weeks in March to attend a class downtown and it was perfect. Only 3 blocks from the MUNI stop and about 10 blocks from the BART one block from a 24 hour Safeway store and tons of restaurants - sushi Mexican pasta and 'Goooood Frikin Chicken'. Even better was the full private kitchen I saved a lot of cash by not eating out. Scott was a gracious host answering the few questions I had very quickly and leaving me to my studies the rest of the time. The TV is in the loft so you can watch as you drift off to sleep. Even being a larger person I had no trouble getting in and out of the loft bed and it was extremely comfortable. I had a much more restful stay than some of my classmates who paid a lot more to stay downtown near Union Square. I highly recommend this cozy retreat!
14451638,142314690,2017-04-07,113682961,Kenneth,Ernest is a fantastic host! He was very prompt in his email/phone responses when I had questions. He was gracious in asking if I needed any accommodations or had any questions. I was thrilled to check in early because the housekeeper helped me out. The room was quite clean. For about $50 a night this room was way more than I expected. The bathroom is a little cramped but honestly it was fitting for the price. The additional bath towels toilet paper etc. were a fantastic addition. There is a kitchen/laundry room/common area for your various needs (although I didn’t need to use this much). In the common area there is a filtered water dispenser; I used this a lot! Be mindful that this is a shared house so at times it can get a little bit noisy. You access the room through the garage door which was fully functional and locked just fine. Check out was a breeze. I would highly recommend this room for a week’s stay as it is spatially close to Mission St. (there are some fantastic authentic restaurants on this street). Downtown San Francisco is but an $8 Uber/Lyft ride away which was also very convenient. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. 
5559608,297957445,2018-07-28,201418201,Stanley,Great place to stay with plenty of free street parking. Would stay again. 
9910056,76051819,2016-05-24,9851631,Jim,David's place is conveniently located minutes from downtown. The apartment was clean and had all amenities listed. 
2124182,11526781,2014-04-06,43238,Elise,Eduardo was great at responding quickly and his place was quiet and sunny with very pleasant views of nearby yards and gardens.  Would definitely stay there  again.
26261610,480412675,2019-07-02,14210314,Betsy,Joey's place was one of my best Airbnb experiences. Everything I needed was there and it was easy to check-in and get settled. Great location!
14804950,123113147,2016-12-27,15903650,Meg,Overall this is a good space. Very good for the price and location and excellent if you have a dog. The decorations were very nice and they made good use of the tiny space. In the winter it is very cold and takes a long time for the heater. Since this is a true studio it is best for one person since using the toilet can be awkward. The shower and foot towel definitely could've been cleaner but hopefully this was a one time oversight.
31595144,417033315,2019-02-25,182049412,Rene,Great stay. Definitely would book again.
21385697,417550403,2019-02-27,126867865,Nonye,Keisha was a lifesaver last night! I had unexpected late night and couldn’t imagine doing a 2 hour commute in between the 7 hours of when I got off from work & my morning gig. I was able to receive a quick response from her and have a warm well rested night in her home. I’d totally book with her again if I’m in a bind again thanks again!
9587361,541139818,2019-10-04,30182036,Sandra,Great location parking was available and not too difficult numerous restaurants within walking distance and a mini-mart only 1/2 block away.
21057777,515334063,2019-08-22,72631154,Paul,Lovely suite location is out of the centre but there is all you need within 5 mins walk including a fast bus to town supermarkets bars and restaurants..
664307,560761076,2019-11-07,273078606,Matthue,Great place super thoughtful!
1767569,154070456,2017-05-22,18471111,Patrick,Lydia's house was large clean and comfortable and perfectly located near to Hayes Street with it's many bars and restaurants. Also within easy reach of public transport so trips to the city or elsewhere were easily made. We didn't meet Lydia but she responded immediately to and questions that we had. Thanks again for our stay!
8859249,423299191,2019-03-13,25062466,Elizabeth,Nice location.  Great communication.  Everything was as expected.  Nice outside deck to sit on.  Perfect for 2 a bit crowded for 3.  King bed is new and very comfortable.  Extra bed is a cot.
14553693,213547690,2017-11-21,148709319,Matthew,My wife and I stayed at Syd and Rosa’s for 3 nights on a road trip that ended in San Francisco. 5 stars all the way around for this place. Syd and Rosa were incredibly nice and helpful with recommendations. There’s plenty of places to see within walking distance and we never had to wait more than two minutes for an Uber if something was farther away. Definitely recommend!
15051965,567145968,2019-11-21,17499720,Benny,They are great host
17343208,556909439,2019-10-30,45010803,Francois,Very special place and good feeling. Liked the common space very pleasant and great to meet other travelers. Actually and unlike what I first expected this is where we slept best in all our stay (we had the Red Wood bed room top floor)
1618782,283388657,2018-06-29,49373924,Jordyn,We had a wonderful stay!  Young Mi was very helpful and the location was convenient to visit all over the city. We would definitely stay at this spot again!  Thank you Young Mi!
4663060,26214877,2015-02-07,24872784,Erin,"My boyfriend and I had a great time in San Fran- thanks so the perfect place. 

It is as descried- minimalist apartment but in the cutest area. We loved being about to walk a few blocks down to Church St and have access to coffee shops restaurants and stores. I will say the hills are no joke- so pack comfy shoes :) Just a ten minute walk down Noe takes you to even more cute restaurants etc located on 24th Street. The view of the town from your front step is adorable. 

We were also pleasantly surprised by the public transportation system. You can walk two blocks down the street and jump on the MUNI- bus system (Route J) and it will take you down to Dolores Park and connects to BART- metro system. All very easy to navigate and you can grab a Clipper card at Walgreens and load money. Made it very easy to enjoy a peaceful home at night but gives you the ability to explore the city as well and not have to pay for cabs constantly. 

The apartment was very clean- with a mini fridge with some beverages and travel sized necessities in bathroom along with other items. Made it nice to be able to toss in a few items in the fridge since we were there a few nights. All the items were very helpful as we were running low on some items during end of our trip. There is plenty of storage too an closet space. The small heater came in handy our first night since it was a bit chilly- thanks for that!! 

It was also about a fifteen minute drive from the airport if that's how you are arriving. We did not have a car but did notice ample parking as well- just be weary of hills :) 

I only had a few questions and Mark was very quick to respond and very helpful. 

Thanks again for a great place to stay! We left saying we loved San Fran and all the various parks we explored but could see ourselves living in Noe Valley because of it's charm!  

We look forward to returning!! "
1815551,22770238,2014-11-14,1918929,Blake,The apartment is well located -- not far from Mission Dolores Park and Noe Valley. The kitchen was functional and Sarah had coffee tea cream waters and a bottle of wine which was a nice touch. Also I really loved the bathroom -- included nice easy to use shower stall -- which I felt was the best part of the flat. There is a great view of the city from the outdoor terrace but it is shared and unfortunately for me I didn't have much time to use it. The major downside of the unit is that it is rather dark as there is not a lot of natural light.
1433917,95293247,2016-08-19,70840195,Sandra,From the moment our taxi pulled up I knew this was going to be a good when I saw Mick waiting for us. We are a six month trip and have two heavy bags but this was not a problem there is a chair lift up the front stairs. Mick put on bags on the lift and before we knew it we were in this wonderful little flat. The location is perfect and if you did little else you would be constanly entertained  watching the amazing people of Castro going by. As it happened the bad cold I arrived with turned into pneumonia and I spent almost the entire week we were there in the flat. In another setting this would have been disappointing but there were so many lovely classy touches and the facinating history of their grandfather and the flat including wonderful old family photos I found it soothing somehow. It is clear this is a much loved home and all the little special touches bring this out. Everything is top drawer but somehow homey as well. I could not sleep for several nights so propped myself up in one of the super comfy chairs and when I tired of watching the street I  watched TV which offered premium cable and netflicks. There were complimentary chocolates and other goodies which also helped me feel better. This is a great place to stay and we plan to return on our next trip to San Francisco.
134015,11021525,2014-03-17,8643437,Anna,We had a WONDERFUL stay at Heidi's apartment. Everything was perfect : very well located - on the most famous street of SF ! Very quiet with very good beds ! And the deck is AMAZING! We had breakfast everyday on this stunning terrace. Lovely. You made our trip unique. Thanks a lot. Xxx Anna
21785328,321160375,2018-09-09,138435977,Jenny,We had a great stay. It was close to many touristy places. We walked around for most of our trip. Hiromi couldn’t check us in but made sure someone was there to assist us. She checked in on us afterwards and was very kind. It can get a little noisy because it is in downtown but for how close by everything was it wasn’t so bad. There are also a lot great restaurants nearby!
14552166,503313089,2019-08-05,91458422,Mike,Be sure to read previous reviews. This is an old - but clean and updated- hotel. Room was just what I needed (as a single 59 year-old male) though in a sparse design. No real in-room extras (no refrigerator coffee maker ironing board/iron hair-dryer etc) though a kitchen and laundry room can be found on the 2nd floor. Think twice about booking this place or anything in or on the edge of the Tenderloin (hit Wikipedia for a good description) if traveling with children or family. Didn't really interact with the staff but they all seemed pleasant enough. Overall it was a good value in a central location for my visit.
3832296,33840828,2015-06-01,33159232,Eric,Michaels place was great very clean and neat. The keyless entry was so helpful since I arrived late the first night. The location was perfect as I made trips to both Silicon Valley for work and San Francisco for fun. Couldn't ask for a better trip thanks Michael!
1421774,251335794,2018-04-07,177693424,Ute,Das liebevoll eingerichtete gemütliche Studio mit allem modernem Komfort war ein toller Ausgangspunkt für die 3 autolosen Tage in San Francisco. Vor allem um sich im Mission und Castro District zu tummeln. Aber auch gut für den Rest der Stadt durch die gute öffentliche Anbindung. Vielen Dank Vanick!
1641060,488228134,2019-07-14,173617657,Kata,The apartment is sparkling clean  Sharon is very easy to communicate with. We stayed there with my husband and 2 kids we really enjoyed the place. The master bed is so comfy my husband and I slept for 12 hrs one night :))
13175533,254079533,2018-04-15,49377631,Katie,Simone’s place was extremely clean and well put together! The bed was wonderful and comfortable and there were really cute thoughtful touches all around the apartment. Simone even had a huge binder put together of recommendations in the area and a hand drawn map of walkable spots for food coffee and shopping! The neighborhood was very quite and I could see the ocean down the road!
1142101,84930680,2016-07-09,22625685,Sarah,"Christine's place is in the quieter part of the city and a great location for those looking for a calmer stay but with great access to everything the city has to offer.

It has close access to a few bars restaurants and supermarket all within walking distance and a great outdoor space for evening dining. 

Inside Christine's home is well kept and equipped the rooms are spacious and the downstairs room and ensuite provide good personal space for anyone in your family who may be staying with you.

Christine was fast at responding and there to answer any questions we had."
8859249,128676911,2017-01-26,62000065,Christina,Erika and Gary were great hosts! I had to check in super late due to my flight being canceled earlier that day. They left the lights on for me and great instructions on how to check in. The room is spacious and space is well used. Loved my entire stay! They even sent me a list on restaurants and things to do in the area since It was my first time to SF! Thank you such a great visit! 
17979286,278807691,2018-06-18,173705940,Susanne,"We (2 adults 1 infant - 11 months) had a wonderful time in Georgina's and Suresh's apartment.
They made sure we had a perfect stay.
We spent three weeks with our son who was not quite a year at that point.
In advance Georgina asked us what she could arrange to make us feel comfortable. So a high chair and a baby crib were ready to be used when we arrived :)

Important note for an extended stay: Washer and dryer are always available.

We had a great time at their house. Everything was as shown in the pictures. It's very clean the equipment is in good shape and Georgina and Suresh are very friendly and helpful hosts.

In summary: we can highly recommend this AirBnB :-)

Also it was easy to find free street parking close to the home (a big plus in San Fran).  Scott was easy to communicate with and responded quickly.  I would love to stay at his place again.
1815551,10532390,2014-02-24,370323,Vanessa,This was a great location for us. It's near the J line and there are a lot of great places to walk shop and explore. Everything was clean and ready for us when we arrived and it was easy to get in and settled. Sarah was a great host and we really appreciated the use of their pack n play for our young son.

17405370,434896348,2019-04-08,235693767,Stacy,I highly recommend this place.  It is the perfect location near Fisherman's Warf and it was very clean and a nice cozy set up.  It's perfect for up to 4 people.  The individuals who rent it were very cordial and easy to communicate with.  We had the time of our lives staying at this place!  Such a great place to stay!
208831,2677585,2012-10-22,2444766,Lisa,Peter is a great host very friendly and helpful. Peter's apartment is in a great location walking distance to many restaurants. The apartment is also clean and spacious. Definitely recommend. 
16055131,251845080,2018-04-08,31103271,Rebekah,Stylish and clean! The place was perfect for us. We loved the giant wall chalk board
30128798,487173801,2019-07-13,131091661,Kate,Place was much more than we expected. The photos’s don’t do the space you have justice. We loved the fact that there are two doors from the street. We felt very secure! The home was styled beautifully with all the amenities that we needed. Our host’s did a great job communicating with us we would highly recommend this Air B&B for your next stay in San Francisco!!
1827177,59259025,2016-01-08,5709283,Victoria,The room was exactly as advertised nice size room with a large private bathroom next door. The house was in a great location very accessible to plenty of public transportation routes which was great. Also great food places close by.
5154367,229635859,2018-01-24,44796348,Diamond,Dayne's place is exactly add described. The bed is extremely comfortable and it felt like I was really at home. Plenty of space for your clothes and a 5 minute walk to the train. I am also in love with the dog! Will be back for sure...
6557736,438461304,2019-04-16,74725131,Leslie,Very pleasant stay comfortable and easy to find.
6119683,518985869,2019-08-27,2181566,Natalie,Dino's place is great! The location for us was the main selling factor. Awesome neighborhood! The place is clean and comfortable and Dino and James were super helpful and accommodating hosts. lt's in a lively and fun neighborhood so if are sensitive to street noise keep this in mind.
7222704,59902291,2016-01-17,48879171,Russell,Really enjoyed the place. Very cozy and had several features that made the flat one of a kind. About a 40 min bus ride into downtown which kinda stinks but I found to trust the area. If you want a quiet place outside the city but close enough for a quick drive or close-ish bus ride this is the place. I found the flat to be slightly better than advertised. The pictures don't necessarily do the place justice. Would stay here again! 
10193457,494657642,2019-07-24,172839797,Corinne,C’est un lieu d’accueil très agréable dans un quartier très très joli au bord de l’océan au calme pause agréable après la visite de la ville
1017799,151435910,2017-05-12,29875187,Miguel,Great place to stay if you're in the city and don't mind being out in the UCSF area. I'd stay again. 
288213,177755973,2017-08-03,37095664,Jessica,Really great space and loved that they had an honor bar which was a nice touch. I loved the size of the space the little patio outside (despite not being able to use it) and the bed was lovely. Jared was great at keeping communication open and very responsive. GREAT spot for a work trip and I would absolutely stay here again. 
2694526,104470952,2016-09-26,49374132,Row,"My stay at the beach retreat with Lele and Vivian was simply wonderful. I needed somewhere to live whilst I looked for my own place having just moved out here and I couldn't have found a better place to start my new adventure! 

Their apartment is wonderful clean homely and relaxed. All the other AirBnb guests were great so it was never an issue having new people come and go. Milo is a real cutie and their outdoor space on the patio is a lovely place to hang out and relax. The location is also great with the bus into town only a short walk away. You're also super close to the beach and the park so you couldn't wish for more! Love the fact my room had a coffee machine and a mini fridge too.

Vivian and Lele are both amazing hosts — they not only made me feel welcome and at home while I was there but also included me when they hosted the odd barbecue with friends. Everything was just wonderful — it was hard to leave when my stay was up! 

I'd highly recommend staying at the Beach Retreat. Absolutely lovely."
3946571,552536736,2019-10-21,5226512,Tomek,Elizabeth is very hospitable has a great and very excited dog ;) and apartment is cosy and well located. Would stay again!
18904,110824281,2016-10-28,57515979,Leila,The room is exactly as pictured.  It's clean cozy and peaceful.  The bed is comfortable and I slept well each night.  Patrick is an excellent host!  He provided me with a map of bus and train routes in addition to recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the city.  He is very friendly and welcoming!
487499,11240362,2014-03-26,10950217,Benjamin,I have only very positive things to say.  I stayed here for a month while visiting at Berkeley and not only is the apartment conveniently located in a wonderful neighbourhood with easy access to BART it was a beautiful and quiet space and Daniel was absolutely superb as a host.  He is helpful generous and takes pride in the experience of staying in this apartment.  I cannot recommend it highly enough! 
22826843,347714210,2018-11-11,2423050,Megha,Victor is a friendly thoughtful and clean host and his apartment is in a fantastic location! The room has everything you need - from a coffee machine to snacks and the apartment is large clean and well-maintained. Victor was very friendly and even stocked the fridge with avocados and grapes. Would definitely recommend!
6749412,71691478,2016-04-27,61127896,Mike,"This place was great. My group was here to see SF for the first time so not alot of time was spent at the apartment. That being said we had no issues while staying here. The description of the listing was accurate. The apartment was very spacious especially the living room.  The location on Potrero Hill had a great view of the city. Parking was easier to find than I expected as well. 

The hosts were easily accessible either in person or through airbnb messaging."
13127954,156512617,2017-05-30,112304346,Theodore,The place is just as advertised and the hosts respond really quickly. Super clean great view in the living room and the thing about the construction is only bothersome if you are going to stay indoors all day. However from what I remember the noise isn't super loud. Great place to stay!
11437331,551885641,2019-10-20,30826747,Brett,"I enjoyed three nights at Maria's home when visiting San Francisco for study. 
The house is very welcoming and very quiet perfect for study.
Maria' dog Sequoia is lovely and a nice companion. The property is located walking distance to the city and there are a number of bars and restaurants locally. Highly recommended."
3870174,121382988,2016-12-16,2991244,Paul,"There are so many great things to say about Jack and Jason's place that I don't know where to start. First off the room itself is very large and comfortable. You have your own TV with the new Apple TV your own bathroom and even your own mini fridge. Everything in the room is new and modern and clean. Your door locks and is on its own floor (along with the other guest room) so you have a lot of privacy and it feels like you have your own studio apartment.

Jack and Jason are very friendly communicative and accommodating. They always made sure I had everything I needed offered to wash my towels and when they had friends over on the weekend made sure to ask if they weren't being too loud (they weren't).

The location is fantastic with tons of great restaurants and shops just a quick walk away. There is also a bus stop just around the corner to get downtown.

I can't recommend this room enough! It is probably the best Airbnb I have ever rented and I hope it's available the next time I stay in San Francisco."
19417708,496644380,2019-07-27,172815485,Marion,The home was very clean and in a nice neighborhood close to many conveniences. We were very comfortable during our stay.
3850,19528058,2014-09-14,19199357,Hisumi,"We were really enjoy at house.
the break fast is delicious and kitchen was nice.
Kevin taught me how to use an oven so we could make a biscuit at the house.
"
2460904,12245122,2014-04-27,13346921,Kyle,"Great spot to stay in! I've never been in SF so all I knew is that I needed to be close to my conference. Other then that It was just a couple blocks to the Bay Bridge and lots of neat areas to go wander around in.
Sucks there was so much construction going on closing down some sidewalks and cross walks but that's not Rubeun's fault!

The condo was great. Was easy to find Rubeun made meeting up with him very simple and the condo was very coozy and secure.

Luckily I use Chromecast at home so it only took seconds to get the TV going.
Everything else was easy internet was great and the welcome pamphlet had all the details I needed to get settled.

I plan on going to the conference again next year and as long as it is in the same space I will be for sure be contacting Rubeun for next time!"
567239,82927430,2016-06-30,48572891,Natascha,"Sometimes you meet certain people in your life while traveling and you think 'man that's what traveling is all about!'. 

Although we only stayed at Ed and Judy's place for one night it was an experience we won't forget. They are both warm-hearted friendly and open people. People with a very high likability factor. The perfect hosts. Unfortunately we were just getting to know each other better right before our departure so we felt a little sad we couldn't stay any longer. 

Their house is lovely and has a certain amount of 'zen' to it. It's situated in a decent neighborhood very uphill offering an excellent view of the city from its terrace. Ed gave us great travel tips to town. From our experience downtown wasn't so far. We actually walked from the house to several neighborhoods downtown and enjoyed the diversity.

The room itself is cosy clean and just right. They both offered us breakfast but we wanted to see what the city had to offer. Judy gave us an excellent tip for breakfast. A place called 'Griddle Fresh'.

Thank you Ed and Judy for making our first time experience of San Francisco an unforgettable one!"
1556680,65043870,2016-03-10,47027965,Elif,Ev sahibimiz David bize her konuda çok yardımcı oldu sorularımıza çok hızlı cevap verdi. Zate sorabileceğimiz her sorunun cevabı evde masada duran dosyanın içinde çok güzel ve açıklayıcı bir şekilde cevaplandırılmıştı. Ev konforluydu ve bulunduğu yer toplu taşıma araçlarına oldukça yakındı. Şehir merkezine tek otobüsle indik ve aynı şekilde geri döndük. Seyahatten çok keyif aldık. Teşekkürler David :)
3309722,67285352,2016-03-28,55194918,Cameron,I enjoyed every moment spent in this beautiful apartment.  The bed was super comfy and the deck and views were amazing.  It was extremely hard to leave!
350391,1904605,2012-08-06,2955007,Robert,"Had a fabulous time with Jim and Jeff.
Great stories great hospitality and a great house.
Thumbs up."
2016198,135348258,2017-03-04,104061458,Robert,Very quiet residential setting with ocean view. Reserved parking was nice. Easy walk to ocean. Basic furnishing. Bed comfortable.
18928482,283370942,2018-06-29,6494738,Chad,This is a beautiful home setting on the quiet side of SanFracisco.  Great place and wonderful host!
24224031,555611232,2019-10-27,23897231,Minju,In a residential area you need a car to get around. You will be sharing the space with other travelers. I never met the hosts and they were not the most responsive during my stay. However they gave a detailed and clear instruction to enter the Airbnb. WiFi wasn’t working entire time I stayed and bed & pillow are bumpy and uncomfortable. Kitchen appeared to be in good quality and updated. Ideal Airbnb for someone seeking for a bed and a shower (much like a hostel).
4252808,358029042,2018-12-12,214821950,Chris,Great apartment better host!

35512958,558172734,2019-11-02,40975332,Ellen Laura,Lovely clean space larger than I thought. Loved the local area felt safe and at home loved the sunset over the beach every night. Would stay another week anytime.

1556680,64460920,2016-03-04,59482530,Joslyn,"We had an amazing experience with our rental. It was cozy and exactly what we were looking for. The house was very Clean and the backyard was so relaxing. 

It's close to the park and the area seemed good. It is a little far from downtown but an uber/lyft/bus make it easy and affordable to get to. 

I would stay at this house again! "
749744,30394325,2015-04-21,17309812,Chris,"The apartment is cute with nice outdoor space. The place looks just like the pictures. If you have a child there are tons of toys and all the equipment (baby bed pack-n-play stroller) you could ever need and love not having to travel with. My 2 year-old daughter could not stop talking about her ""new house."" The location is great with the park Haight street and and Cole street all right there. Also the cooking area is roomy for a smaller apartment and it is a nice gas stove to cook on. Camille was very responsive welcoming and the in-depth descriptions are nearby restaurants and shops were accurate and helpful."
7922690,53558488,2015-11-09,14973628,Melody,Our stay was delightfully clean and quiet. Our hosts were very accommodating of our arrival. The bed in the room we slept in was SO comfortable and the whole house is beautiful. No complaints at all.
8456859,53395264,2015-11-08,14993037,Connie,Joshua and Lizzy welcomed us to their new home and airbnb openly. It is true to the pictures and is more beautiful in person. Great location - close to beach and Golden Gate park. Close by to local eats and food store. Wish had more time to spend in their beautiful backyard and using the fire pit at night to admire stars. Overall we had a great experience and would love to come back next time. 
26718900,472455799,2019-06-19,117384814,Anita,The location of the apartment is really great: very good connection to public transport - in less than 30 minutes you are at Pier 39. In just a few minutes walk is a large grocery store. The kitchen is very rich equipped apparment very clean and cosy. For children additional board games and also access to Netflix movies. All  information was carefully put together in a folder. Very quick response and we felt really at home!
297897,54589382,2015-11-22,5507455,Jess,House exactly as listed- Tim was warm to welcome us accommodated our request to drop bags off by inviting us to just check in early. GREAT location. We had three adults and two children in the house it was spacious and clean. MUNI N tram literally blocks away which takes you into the heart of san fran in about half an hour- easy to then get around to the main attractions. Great beauty vibe great local cafes near the MUNI stop for amazing coffee and breakfast. We had a small problem with the house that was out of our control and Tim fixed it immediately and then dropped wine and some chocolate off to apologise for the minimal inconvenience the problem caused. I would 100% recommend Tims place to stay at and wouldn't hesitate to book it again. It was fabulous! Beds very comfy great big bath which was wonderful with the kids good shower pressure... couldn't fault the house at all. Very quiet neighbourhood as well.
3441517,447491366,2019-05-03,3373062,Ana,Judy's place was GREAT! I've stayed in Airbnbs all around the world and this is one of my very favorites and Judy is similarly one of my favorite hosts. Judy was on-hand at check-in and gave a good overview of the apartment had great recommendations on where to eat/public transport nearby/etc. and was genuinely a pleasure to talk with. Small touches across the board went far - providing fruit water yogurt etc. made it feel very homey and she even picked up some delicious pastries for me! She was very fast to respond to my messages as well. The bed was comfortable - the unit itself nicely decorated with a table seating area etc. and is bigger in person that it appears in the picture. The back patio was great as well just to sit on to relax. There was no noise from neighbors or from Judy herself and as a light sleeper I was able to sleep without waking up. Close to public transit and easy to get a rideshare to as well as lots of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. Overall if I could give Judy 6 stars I would and I'll be adding her to my (very short) list of Airbnbs I prefer to stay in when staying in SF.
1043282,262422370,2018-05-08,4389387,José,Talk about an Airbnb Superhost! John is definitely worthy of the title. Unfortunately we could not meet him personally as our schedules did not coincide. However during our short two nights stay he showed off being a seasoned and experienced host “from the distance”; super accommodating attentive and courteous. His entire place looks exactly like in the pictures and more; elegantly museum like furnished and ornamented. The bedroom was ample and technologically enhanced (WiFi speed was he only hick up though); the bathroom clean and the shower hot and well pressured; the bed big and comfortable and the sheets silky soft; and street parking accessible. Perfectly located away from Castro’s more boisterous streets John’s place is a keeper. So far our best private room stay with Airbnb.
26339979,405836823,2019-01-27,3287951,Aria Cyrus,Emmie's spot in the Outer Sunset was fantastic.  She's a great host and very responsive and thoughtful. The place is bright and clean; there are great amenities like a Nespresso machine. And the soaking tub! The Outer Sunset is the perfect spot for having a chill break from the hustle and bustle and this spot is just two blocks from the ocean. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxed getaway in the Bay.
680288,432704833,2019-04-04,21060067,Savannah,Ken's place was lovely we especially loved admiring his garden! Very close to many restaurants and shops and a great place to explore Mission District from. Would definitely recommend.
1080408,519998654,2019-08-29,47216306,혜림,"So lovely house with beautiful decoration. It's located in high area in San Francisco so you can see the whole view of the city while walking along to go his house. And his house is located nearby the muni stop so it'd be better to get muni to come there unlike me haha. 

His house is nearby the Castro where has a lot of places to enjoy. I'll definately choose his house when I get here again. 

Oh and his house is sooo clean for sure. :)"

He doesn't miss a detail and everything is done with the utmost professionalism and hospitality.  I highly recommend this apartment.  And the neighborhood is lovely too!  
99094,500854751,2019-08-03,81761867,Kellie,I had a blast with this Pub crawl we stopped to four different bars and it was so much fun I got to meet different people from all over the world. I’d definitely recommend this pub crawl. Sarah’s the best!

His house is a beautiful historic building with a lot of charme good and safe neighborhood and there is really a lot of space; actually much bigger than you might think when you look at the pictures..."

20311264,199374307,2017-10-01,17841664,Katie,My husband and I had a great stay at Victor's place. After being out searching for our own new SF apartment during the day it was really nice to come back to such a home-y apartment. Victor was quick and helpful with communicating and the place had everything we could have possibly needed!
15330348,234165527,2018-02-11,71568088,Natalia,Out stay at stella' s place was great. Everything was above advertised. The best part is location my husband and I rented a car and parking in front of the house was always easy also everywhere we went it was a 20 min drive from Stella. Definitely a great location a great place and a great host.

8055632,102075523,2016-09-16,23447209,Jesko,Alles war fantastisch der Host ist sehr nett und zuvorkommend. Man hat im Prinzip eine eigene Wohnung die man sich mit anderen Gästen teilt. Sehr viel Platz und gemütlich 
9051149,193239628,2017-09-12,43101001,Nellie,"What a good find!! The location was great and Elmer London and another doggy guest were very welcoming!
Was a really awesome location.. easy drive or Uber around to all of the places you'd want to go.
I parked out front both nights and moved my car by 10am due to restrictions. But it wasn't a problem and there was parking nearby for during the day.
The weather was a little warmer than usual so I'd advise the windows being open maybe as it was super hot when we first got in. 
Will definitely stay here again next time we are in town!!

OH! And make sure Elmer shows you some of London's tricks!!"

6335352,128553660,2017-01-25,110027697,Valerie,We had a wonderful stay in SF and in Vladislav's airbnb on a lovey quiet residential street.  Very clean and spacious accommodation as the pictures show.  A very helpful host who made us welcome in their lovely home. A great family space highly recommended. 
238204,89039335,2016-07-26,24598978,Gary,The communication in advance was quick accurate and smart. On arrival we were shown the unit and made familiar with all the more-than-required nuances of great hospitality (the Cherrios coffee and fruit was too nice). We were simply delighted. The location was perfect for our purposes. Right on the L MUNI line a block away from a nice breakfast place an easy walk over to the zoo AND a great neighborhood coffee place (Java Beach). Did I mention 3 blocks from the ocean? Just perfect for us and we'd be delighted to come back.

I can highly recommend staying at her place when you are in SF. I stayed there with a friend and our experience in this is city wouldn't have been the same if we didn't stay at Lindy's. Lindy herself is super nice and easy going. Thanks for an awesome time Lindy :)
6335352,429348985,2019-03-27,17383012,Mandy,Vlad's place is an exceptional find that deserves this 5 star review (I'm not just being nice). It's interior is beautifully styled and well equipped with all the amenities we needed (including a portable rolling crib that is so much better than a pack-n-play!).  You can walk to Philz for coffee and then cross the street for a cute neighborhood playground as long as you are prepared for hills. The home itself and the neighborhood were the perfect kid-friendly option for our two little ones who are 3 years old and 10 months. Thanks Vlad we hope to come back!
10876562,265920784,2018-05-18,117175069,Carlos,The apartment is fantastic. Great location and stunning view! Madison was a great host and always available. I highly recommend this place.

14996188,208950857,2017-11-03,52578574,Alexandra,This spot is in such a great area walking distance from the grocery store and a short drive to restaurants and shops. The space is one of the coolest I've stayed in! Extremely stylish and every inch is utilized so well. I stayed here for a work trip and it was the best place to relax after a long day!
21594483,294223857,2018-07-21,202168401,Veronica,Wonderful first Airbnb experience. great lol neighborhood. wonderfully located. my teenage daughter and I had a lovely time at Vasily' s place.
3611131,497778527,2019-07-28,97250808,Sareena,Mylinh’s place was exactly as described and the pictures are an accurate representation of the space no surprises! It was very clean and they’ve added a dehumidifier to combat the moisture of a garden level unit which was a nice touch! The bed and pillows were comfortable and the towels were very plush! I read some of the other reviews mentioned a smell but the only thing I smelled when I walked in was a clean apartment! The location of the unit is great within walking distance to a lot of great spots. All in all I would recommend the space but maybe not for the hotter months in the city as the unit doesn’t have AC and seems to retain warmth. We were okay since the weather was 66-70 Fahrenheit during our stay.
24162068,547311707,2019-10-14,144315122,Dawn,Wondetful home in the Mission area-close to restaurants grocery stores bakeries and coffee shops! John is a fantastic host who was very responsive & helpful.  Would stay there again in a minute!
15769324,169798523,2017-07-13,40853080,Axelle,"La chambre est basique lit - lavabo - placard - table - frigo
L'emplacement est tres pratique lorsque l'on vient de l'aéroport il y a juste à prendre le BART jusqu'à la station Powell St (9$) et l'hôtel est juste à la sortie du metro. Il y a tout à proximité. 
Pour les prix des hôtels à SF c'est un rapport qualité prix correct. "
2046634,34109464,2015-06-04,10264259,Felix,Kenix was very welcoming and made sure that I had a great stay. Everything was as described and I would definitely recommend staying here!

4069838,209671020,2017-11-05,127447065,Brian,Ashely was an exceptional host. She was helpful and kind throughout the process. The house was stocked with maps and information about the city. The backyard was adorable. She filled the bathroom with extra toiletries and simple touches that made us feel welcomed and taken care of. The check in and check out were easy. We loved staying here and would definitely stay again on our next trip to San Fran!
17430696,294203514,2018-07-21,168265044,Kory,Had a GREAT stay here! We were given an amazing detailed instruction sheet on how to get to the place from SFO and great instructions on getting into the place. Loved all of the extra touches that were unexpected but great to have :) thanks again! 
1261074,68232942,2016-04-03,55588621,Jose Luis,"Jay fue un anfitrión muy amable y cortés. La habitación y todos los espacios compartidos estaban muy limpios aparte de ser muy agradables y tener un gusto exquisito por la decoración.

La habitación era muy acogedora la cama excelente quizás faltaba espacio porque llevábamos muchas maletas. 

La ubicación es perfecta para llegar al centro rápido y está al lado de barrios notables y famosos que valen la pena visitar y que desde aquí se pueden hacer a pie.

Es un espacio totalmente recomendable y no dudaría ni un segundo en aconsejárselo a amigos y conocidos."
1768239,13254726,2014-05-23,9392446,Phoebe,"We had a great stay at Deb & Greg's apartment. The place is exactly as pictured - super clean and very modern (nice bathroom too). The view is better than pictured! Deb & Greg were great hosts easily accessible and quick to reply should you have any questions.

Would definitely stay here again if I visited SF again."

9532943,100018133,2016-09-06,26511951,Christopher,We had a very good start with tony. He provided all the needed information's like address access codes and so on on time. The apartment was very clean and looked what the pictures showed before. The apartment is in the center of San Francisco. You can walk to all sights and you have nice restaurants and bars very close. Directly next to the entrance is the best thai restaurant of the town. The neighborhood is a bit shady but not dangerous. We would recommend the apartment of tony. It was a very nice stay.
13602723,240712584,2018-03-05,109191638,Nonye,Kate and Barry were amazing hosts! They were very accommodating about altering my reservation after my flight was canceled. The one thing is that the location is not particularly walkable---you will need to Uber to downtown if you want to get there quickly
545685,161902149,2017-06-18,61085414,Yann,Good suite spacious very clean in a quiet neighborhood. Su at all time kept a good communication and was helpful. 
18602265,477745938,2019-06-28,76617270,Gaylen,My family of 4 was very comfortable in Anna's place.  We spent most of our days exploring the city but enjoyed the cozy studio that welcomed us in evenings with comfortable beds basic kitchen amenities plenty of hot water in shower and peaceful back patio.  Also we rode the Muni downtown most days and appreciated it's close proximity to her place.  Anna welcomed us our first day and made sure we knew where everything was and that we could contact her for anything.  She also provided us with maps books and suggestions for places to go.  We had a great time and will definitely stay here again when visiting  San Francisco.
30318695,508401658,2019-08-12,11295900,David,Great place.  Very clean and it's walking distance to restaurants and a supermarket.

35058339,498992793,2019-07-30,953457,Jessica,We really enjoyed our stay at Michelle’s place in Cow Hollow. The apartment was very spacious especially for SF sparkling clean with cozy beds. The street was quiet and residential but within close walking distance to many restaurants and shops. Also only a short walk to Presidio Park. A perfect spot to launch our exploration of San Francisco. Would definitely recommend!
20155597,507701855,2019-08-11,65495841,Jenae,"The space: As mentioned in other comments this space is much more spacious than the pictures suggest. This place easily fit four women for the weekend. The beds were comfy and the location allowed us to get around the city easily by ride share. We had problems with the tricky elevator when we arrived but Matthew was extremely helpful with the process. 
The host: Matthew was an extremely friendly helpful and attentive host. He would respond to questions quickly and efficiently and really wanted to make sure everything was going well. This place is a great value and I would definitely recommend staying here!"

7009809,288456732,2018-07-09,68502608,Randa,This is simply the best!  There were six of us and the home is so large that we had space to get away from each other.  We even entertained on two occasions.  The kitchen is fabulous to cook in and has plenty of quality utensils etc.  parking was never a problem which in itself can be an issue in SF.  Neighborhood is quiet and convenient to everything.  You can even see the Golden Gate Bridge from the property.  This home is beautiful well appointed and super clean.  Check in is easy as well.  Definitely somewhere I’d want to come to again and again.
18775188,298841914,2018-07-29,180480697,Sallie,Wonderful location and an immaculate space!

Quiet neighborhood.
Convenient location."
2739477,38994843,2015-07-20,26737162,Ann,"Brian's House is just as wonderful as indicated by the photos in the deskription. 
We got great advices through mail concerning restaurants in the area. Instructions concerning key to the house and houserules were clear and easy understandable. 
The view of the SF skyline from the bedroom is fantastic both night and day. And the bathroom - must be experienced. 
The neighborhood is lovelyand it is close to public transportation. We could not wish for a better place to stay. 
There were trash in the backyard/graden when we arrived and no instructions what to do with our own trash. A problem that could have been easily solved. "
4638678,77597599,2016-06-02,8399109,Sarah,"The staff was very friendly room was clean and freshly painted and the location perfect. However when I arrived there was a note telling me construction would be occurring nearby and I thought ""no big deal."" As it turned out there were workers hammering and painting right outside my room so this was a less than perfect experience."
20388193,252917227,2018-04-12,182964935,Jarrett,Really enjoyed staying in the Serenity room. The bed was probably one of most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The room also had charging ports in the sockets.
13128357,147438604,2017-04-26,1617339,Allison,"My coworker stayed here. Here's what she said ""Host were very gracious and kind. Always checked in with me to make sure I was comfortable. Awesome people! House and views were beautiful.
House guest were really kind as well. Really enjoyed my stay I'll be back!"""
1785463,459080311,2019-05-26,32445716,Shawn,This home is immaculate beautiful and wonderfully eclectic in a very great location.  There are rules to abide by but if you are a reasonably responsible adult looking for peace and quiet this is an excellent place to stay.
11532945,222822557,2017-12-30,4303401,Daniel,"Our family of four had a great two-week stay in the garden apartment. It is convenient comfortable and secluded while also being right in the heart of Noe Valley and super close to transport and local amenities. Both beds were comfortable and the garden is a real plus. 

It is good value especially for San Francisco. As highlighted by other reviewers the only bathroom is en-suite to the master bedroom but this was not a major issue for our small family and I would definitely recommend to others. 

Alex was a thoughtful and responsive host and Eddie was super helpful for a few small questions that came up as well. Thank you both!"
11549175,108646585,2016-10-16,91761940,Juan,It was close to the park and lots of room.
59344,28654774,2015-03-28,27642792,Miryam,"Really good place to stay every thing is like the photos and the brief said. The studio has an independent entrance everything is very clean and quiet my husband and I love it and definitely if we came back to SF we will looking for stay at John's house. 
The neighborhood is really access to the downtown and the bay area the MUNI(the metro and public Transportation of SF) is only one block away from the studio and it communicates with all the city. 
Noe Valley is a quiet neighborhood but at the same time it has many good restaurants to go. 
Its our first experience with Airbnb and we love it definitely we are gonna use it again.  
The best thing is that John and his wife are excellent hosts we enjoy the experience."
5919500,531497915,2019-09-17,28576156,Josh,Cora's place was great for my quick business trip. Very comfortable bed nice blackout curtain in front of bed area if needed. Seamless check in. Would stay again!
1738415,26869258,2015-02-21,4091426,Amy,"We were delighted with Donna's Hayes Valley flat. Very spacious light and extremely clean! The bed was comfortable and made up with good quality linens.
Donna has exactly the right mix of interesting pieces of furniture and space for all of a visitor's needs. The welcome treats from a local patisserie were a thoughtful touch. And the house manual provided some great local tips.
Donna greeted us personally and was available to answer any queries. This has been our best AirBnB experience to date!!! Thank you Donna :)"
1277771,50738553,2015-10-14,25127193,Christian,"We (5 adults) stayed at Jon and Christine's apartment and it really felt like a home away from home. The neighbourhood is really beautiful and we felt very safe. We also enjoyed the short walk to Baker Beach to get a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge by night. 

We will definitely recommend the apartment."
10137578,210699190,2017-11-10,42052226,Jeremy,Very busy household during the morning and the afternoon. I thoroughly enjoy how quiet it was at night and like having a parking spot right in front of the place I was staying. Free WiFi was nice as well.

We were sad when we traveled further just because of the apartment. We love it and will come again. Thank you Kelly.
2629833,23732546,2014-12-08,4376732,Nick,Josh's apartment is spacious with wonderful light and a great aesthetic. It's minutes away from the buzz of Valencia and the Mission but on a quieter street. Had a enjoyable stay there would happily go back.

325478,147044878,2017-04-24,1105740,Julia,Markus' apartment was perfect for our family of 2 adults and a 2 year old.  It is in in the most perfect location being around the corner from Dolores park as well as walking distance to so many great restaurants and cafes.  The apartment was clean and had all the amenities you could need.  Communication was super easy and fast with Markus and Marina and they were so lovely and flexible with us which just made the process so seamless and pleasurable.  Would highly recommend Markus' apartment to anyone looking for a great San Francisco experience.  Hope to be back one day soon!

Would definitely consider going back the next time I have to stay in SF"
16256179,135354882,2017-03-04,58888191,Eric,"The communication from Kathi the size of the home the layout and the location were great. It had what we needed for our 7 people stay. 

However there were some issues with cleanliness and organization in the home. Odds and ends were found in many different places in the home. The kitchen utensils plates pots and pans felt unusable for personal health concerns. The appliances were great however. 

I have given my suggestions to Kathi and hope that she makes good on them for future guests. If you don't mind the issue I mentioned above and just need a place to stay for a short period of time it is perfectly fine. "

Thank you Jessica!"
21694548,250324124,2018-04-04,1249246,Brad,This was an outstanding space even better than I expected. It's up a long flight of stairs but it's in the back of the building so even with some windows open it was rather quiet and peaceful. The building is across the street from Golden Gate Park which was very handy. It's also close to Haight-Ashbury where you can find many great places to eat and shop. It's a great location for exploring all the many wonderful spots in the Western part of the city.
259621,554106605,2019-10-25,211748146,Oleksander,Great place to stay if u rent a car be sure to research parking in the area. They had some fun activities planned out & were nice.
5480795,296402132,2018-07-25,71600861,Mark,The apartment is in a great location. Staff are friendly and helpful. Only downside was the lack of air conditioning and also no light in the main area of the apartment made it hard to see at night.
13602723,416651843,2019-02-24,52946754,Jimmy,Kate makes an entire one-bedroom available.  No cooktop which I wouldn't use anyway but she provided a wonderful coffee machine and fruits and snacks.  Very thoughtful!  Communications were fast and helpful.  Her place is farther south than I expected but public transportation is available and I used it during the day to get to places and Lyft at night to get back to her place.  Lovely place to stay.
208831,103078339,2016-09-20,25866473,Patrick,Absolutely loved the apartment and you seriously cannot beat the location.  Peter was not in town when we arrived but he made sure someone was there to great us and make sure we were settled.  My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. 
2486953,20215690,2014-09-25,4376732,Nick,"Vincent is a professional and gracious host. He welcomed me when I arrived showed me around the apartment and let me know that he was there if I needed anything but then left me to my own devices for the whole trip. Perfect balance between accessibility and independence.

The apartment is very well put together and immaculate. More like a room you'd get at a boutique hotel. High quality fittings and great range of premium bath supplies. Plus nice snacks dotted around the place.

A few minutes walk to the bustle of Castro."
13735664,262387124,2018-05-08,13749295,Jo,If you are looking for the Airbnb spirit of belonging this is the place to come! Before arrival Linda's communications were prompt clear and friendly. Rooms were noticeably clean. I felt an incredible sense of attention to detail and that this delightful person chooses to host because she loves people not just for money. Staying here was a truly pleasurable experience and I hope to come back someday.
626349,15709439,2014-07-14,5990200,Lauren,Sean was an amazing host! Left great instructions and was always available by phone if I had any questions.

14934208,282927850,2018-06-28,191201687,Angee,"I honestly don't know where to begin. You can tell from the listing that this is a unique place to stay. What you don't know is that this place is not just a (wicked) cool themed apartment; it's a home away from home.  Collin's level of service and attention to detail are five-star quality. You'll see this in the neat amenities you didn't know you needed such as the reading light above the bed. And while Potterheads such as myself will find no shortage of fun items related to the series the truly magical aspect of this stay was the host himself! Thank you again Collin. Your caring nature is felt in every moment from booking through check out. I hope to find myself in SanFran again simply to visit your fantastic place. 

Mischief managed!"
12026845,565783642,2019-11-17,67799051,Robert,Maria is an outstanding host! She knows exactly what each guest is looking for and provides timely and helpful info to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible! Would definitely stay again next time we are in SF!
915058,307613079,2018-08-14,168925715,Hilde,Our first experience with Airbnb was a good one. A marvelous spot quiet and clean.

2105840,431318504,2019-03-31,10722270,Ananya,Claudia's place is located in a very scenic area of the city and makes for an amazing place to stay however you don't get private access to the whole apartment as there would be time when the hall which has been converted into an office will be utilised.
16407735,450228865,2019-05-08,118219650,Vedran,This is great and peaceful location ~30 minutes away from downtown with Muni. Place was clean. Entering apartment with code at any time is very convenient for apartment in family house.
9532943,76102290,2016-05-24,22808687,Merelda,"Apartment is located near Union Sq which is great for first-time visitor to SF! But the Tenderloin district is also just a street or two away so you may have to walk through and it's not the safest especially at night. 

If you have heavy luggage take note that you will have to carry them up stairs since there's no elevator available. Overall I was provided with a fantastic and clean room with basic necessities. Great value for the price I paid. Enjoyed my stay here!"
14577765,128165931,2017-01-22,16445165,Anna,"I had a short but comfortable stay at Ernest's. His home is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood in SF. The private room and shared bathroom was very clean and it was perfect for a weekend in the city. 

Although I never actually met Ernest his communication was excellent and always responded quickly. His instructions were very clear and made for a smooth check-in process. "

Même si le logement est un peu excentré par rapport au centre ville il est néanmoins situé dans une rue calme et dispose d'un accès rapide au transport en public . Parfait pour 2 - 3 personnes. il dispose de tout l'équipement et ustensile nécessaires pour faire un peu de cuisine. Bref nous avons passé un bon séjour.

19194530,305728197,2018-08-11,189883213,D'Arcy,This is a nice space with a pretty garden.  It is a very small studio and the second bed didn’t have sheets we could find.  The kitchen was fully stocked.  The hosts are quiet and considerate.  They did not interfere or get nosy.  The neighborhood (Bayview) is very sketchy and a $10 Lyft ride from downtown.
883937,11486062,2014-04-05,9426739,Phaedra,My friends and I stayed this 1 bedroom Japanese-style apartment for spring break. The location was very ideal for touring restaurants and bars/clubs.

De kamer met privé badkamer en toilet is ruim en proper. Ik vond deze zelfs nog beter dan op foto. Vanuit de kamer heb je een mooi uitzicht. 
Ik zal Lindy zeker terug contacteren bij een volgende bezoek aan San Francisco."

I met Pete the night I arrived and he was very welcoming and hospitable. He made every effort to make sure my stay was comfortable. The bed and linens were incredibly comfortable  so  much so that I actually looked to see where I could buy them for my own bed. I will definitely stay at  Pete's place again if he will accept me. Highly recommend - Great guy. Best airbandb  experience I have had so far. Thanks Pete

The room is extremely comfortable - as is the entire house. I was in town for a conference but it would be perfect for leisure visit too! The location is excellent and Maria has done a great job of creating a welcoming space."

769734,106707790,2016-10-07,42990952,Byungkwon,"Annie is a great host. She was super responsive to my message. I could get her message almost within 1 hour. Regarding the place it is very accessible from the airport (Uber Pool : $19.50) and it is also not far away from Union Square (Uber Pool: $5.50). 
And I really like two cats here. They seemed to be bit scared in my day 1. But she slept on my bed in 2nd day. 
I definitely want to stay again in this place if I visit San Francisco again. "
8336042,65227515,2016-03-12,7370369,Josefina,Me and my little family stayed at Matthew and Anastasia's place in Bernal Heights/Mission for eight nights and had an absolute wonderful time. You can easily spend a day in the area just having coffee at the local café or looking at all the beautiful Victorian/Edwardian houses and stunning view of the city from the next door Bernal Heights Park. It's worth the hike! The well equipped private studio is modern and the perfect size for a longer stay located in a lush and quiet part of SF but still just a few minutes away from the more happening Mission with all its restaurants bars and shopping. Matthew and Anastasia were the perfect hosts - welcoming friendly easy going and very helpful with everything from the best places to eat in the area and recommendations on what to see when exploring the rest of California. We'd love to come back and hope to do so to!
31057117,401739811,2019-01-15,10974978,Brittany,Best hosts ever! I forgot to book an extra night and they let me stay at the last minute. They’re super flexible and chill. Plus the room is spacious clean and cute (and in a fab location). Can’t recommend highly enough.
12510982,105698851,2016-10-02,33294240,Maryann,The Bunkhouse was just what me and I my husband expected. Simple basic needs met clean small room but not too small and updated. Location was amazing! I felt safe walking around and it's very close to the BART station restaurants and bars! Will definitely stay again. Price was good for what you get friendly staff and safe area. 
654279,228654394,2018-01-20,100667049,Laura,"They had coffee ready in the morning which was so incredibly sweet because I had EARLY morning classes I was attending in the area.

Sehr weiter zu empfehlen."
27267054,435879381,2019-04-11,6970130,Katrina,This is a fantastic place to stay. The room is very nicely decorated and the bed is really comfortable. Nico was a welcoming and helpful host and he has really thought of everything when it comes to amenities (snacks tea ear plugs makeup remover hairdryer face cleanser and more!). The building and room also seemed quite secure which was important to me as a solo female traveler. Another bonus is that the window looks out on a tree-filled courtyard of sorts which is nice to come back to if like me you're not much of a big city person.
727866,102463588,2016-09-18,38921466,Bram,We have a fantastic time in Kevin and Ester's place. They were so welcoming and helpful they made us feel right at home.

Just a perfect place to stay when you're in San Francisco!

17979286,306567923,2018-08-12,124782328,Barbara,Georgina is a great hostess.  She left fresh fruit fresh bread  and homemade granola for us. The refrigerator was also stocked with milk yogurts coffee and teas.  The apartment was perfect for the three of us.  We used Uber to get around the trip from the airport was around 30 dollars and from the apartment to Fisherman’s Wharf was around 20 dollars.

The hosts were helpful as well; the overall feel of the place was as if you were just crashing at a friend's place -- a very warm and comfortable atmosphere. Definitely would recommend and perhaps return one day!

Great communication by Dave and readily available if any questions. One of the window panes was broken by a previous tenant and Dave warned us about that and when we were confused about the parking Dave directed us appropriately.

We came for a conference at Moscone center. The location allowed us to park our car off street and we were only a short drive or Uber ride away from the venue. Highly recommend! Would love to stay again."

The apartment is in a good location close to public transport and opens out onto a lovely garden. We also met their dog and cat they're the 
Sweetest! 
Since it's a basement apartment you can sometimes hear footsteps from above (to be expected) but it wasn't an issue. The rooms aren't that soundproof so we could hear our friend waking up in the next room every morning but it's not really an issue. 
We felt at home during our stay and Mike had given us a great rate. Will stay again. Thanks again for having us! "
21449226,441206925,2019-04-21,205507,Rebecca,Red Victorian is right in the heart of Haight Street. My daughter and I enjoyed the space the texture history funk and variety of souls who also chose the Red Victorian. The common areas were fun kinda like a DIY bed and breakfast. If you like vintage shopping start dreaming the Red Victorian is literally right next door to Decades and across the street from Wasteland among many other Haight St only shops. We had fun! One warning Haight Street gets pretty intense later in the day. My kid is 10 and there is a real sketchiness there with homeless youth tons of open smoking cussing fights unpredictable behavior etc. I recommend avoiding the street tipping into early evening with kids. Mornings were cool like you can really feel the roots of the place and see some shops before the swarm descends. The Red Victorian is a nice haven amongst it all! And a great deal obvi :)

무엇보다 호스트 세명 모두가 친절하고 여행에 도움이 되는 팁을 공유해주었어요.  하루가 끝나고 집에 돌아와서 그날이 어땠는지 내일은 뭐할지 이야기를 나누는 것부터 시작해서 다양한 주제로 이야기를 나눌 수 있어 좋았습니다. 다시 샌프란시스코에 간다면 David의 집에 갈거에요 :)"
13605661,174621892,2017-07-26,3567199,Tanaporn,"I recommend Art's place to everyone visiting San Francisco! His place is located in a safe area 5 mins walk to Bart which brings you to the city in 15 mins. The room is very clean and Art provides everything you would need for your stay; clean towel soap shampoo hair dryer fridge microwave oven  comfy bed and etc.  
Bathroom is clean even we have to share with other guests. The self check in is very easy and Art is very helpful and quick to answer messages. We had a really nice stay at Art's place and we choose his place again when we come back to San Francisco. Thanks a lot again Art!"
29241815,499651545,2019-07-31,165416581,Liska,Mario’s place was pretty nice. Only parking was a little bit difficult. After we found a parking spot we used public transportation for the rest of our stay. That works great because there’s a bus and train station only 3 minutes away. Everything in the kitchen was labeled so you knew exactly where to find what and what you’re allowed to use that’s perfect if you planning to cook food there!
2771128,431220734,2019-03-31,15567117,Sandra,"Sunny super-clean studio with fabulous bath located in Noe Valley. Host is communicative. Gorgeous SF views from yard. Comfortable bed. Easy private access with a few stairs. 
Tips: try Chloe’s Cafe for a fab breakfast. Check out Farmer’s Market Noe Valley Town Square every Saturday AM.  Regent Thai restaurant is in the neighborhood as is Charlie’s Corner a children’s bookstore. Whole Foods is on 24th."

23217998,337587797,2018-10-16,3955490,Pat,"Keith’s rental was excellent! He has a wealth of information to share and was quick to respond if I had a question. It is centrally located in the Castro district so there is quite a bit of noise in the evening. That said this did not bother me at all.
I would recommend staying with Keith"

Elle a  de belles attentions  pour ses clients (café à moudre / thé à disposition ainsi que jus d'orange   lait  bananes  petits  pains lors de notre arrivée sans oublier les bons citrons de son jardin!!) !!  Si vous revenons à SF nous viendrons chez Jennifer à nouveau !!
Nous aurions aimé profiter de sa jolie terrasse mais l'air était un peu trop frais!! Il nous faudra donc revenir...
Son carnet avec toutes les bonnes infos (restos  bars ballades etc...nous a été très utile).
Jennifer est situé à 15' / 900 M à pied du BART ( métro) qui dessert les principaux lieux de la ligne menant en ville  en 10' env. Nous y avons séjourné 9 nuits.
Aussi y a une très belle colline derrière chez elle où l 'on peut monter facilement et qui donne un point de vue exceptionnel à 360° sur la ville!!

2397852,84270630,2016-07-06,19957353,Nancy,Suzy is definitely the Airbnb hostess with the mostess! She met us upon our arrival for a brief tour of her place. We then spent the next several days in awe of her thoughtful and generous accoutrements that added a delightful touch to her pristine unit. It was recently renovated immaculate well stocked and superbly located across from Golden Gate Park. She even has a lovely patio with grill and a garage! Suzy literally has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. We look forward to our next SF visit at Suzy's place!
12832173,90686982,2016-08-01,212080,Shelley,Jim's place is super spacious and is like being at home. It's also right next door to the section of Balboa with a lot of great restaurants. This is the perfect place for families and large groups. Highly recommend. 
19273465,266821556,2018-05-20,93953941,Raechel,"Such a cute place in a quiet location. It was really easy to get into the city about a $10-20 uber ride each time. Check in was really easy and Nitzan always responded quickly. 

My only complaint is that there were not any towels. Like not even a hand towel in the restroom. A bit disappointed by that but other than that everything was great!

Would definitely stay here again!"
10379822,194044409,2017-09-15,1245096,Kevin,Charming home with lots of space and attention to detail. Would definitely book again especially great for a family with kids.

352165,110354223,2016-10-25,2654966,Raya,"Staying at Brian's place in the Castro District was such a treat!
Within just 10-15 walk one can experience the richness of Castro the dynamic culture of the Mission District and the rich history of Haigh street.

Brian's apartment was central quiet and extremely charming with its open concept space and outdoor shower (there is nothing more refreshing than waking up and taking a warm shower while breathing the crispy morning air!)

Cafes restaurants and shopping within a walking distance so many amazing people to meet and bond with - the place is a MUST if you're visiting the area.

My husband and I look forward to going back to San Francisco and will definitely be looking to rent Brian's place again! "

1478708,46765042,2015-09-13,39873459,Heide,Paul and his family were super generous hosts and we thoroughly enjoyed interacting with them.  They gave great advice on food and had lovely breakfast items.  The dog was a complete hit with our daughter.  The room was really nice and clean as was the bathroom.  Bed was really comfortable!

2178509,23835049,2014-12-12,15245542,Santiago,Durante nuestra estadía en san Francisco nos sentimos como en casa. Gregg es muy amable y sus gatos son muy tiernos y respetuosos  el cuarto estuvo excelente muy limpio con espacio suficiente y muy cómodo. Además la cocina esta todo en tiempo disponible para los huéspedes y podíamos tomar la comida de la cocina el baño e muy limpio y con espacio para arreglarse. La ubicación de la casa esta muy bien porque es un barrio muy residencial y a una cuadra del metro el cual te lleva al downtown en 20 minutos y el metro funciona hasta en la madrugada entonces se puede llegar a la casa a casi cualquier hora. Sin duda volvería donde Gregg cuando vuelva a san Francisco
14341440,115738275,2016-11-26,10310211,Kavita,Pamela is a very kind and accommodating host.  She was able to get us a packnplay for our baby which was so helpful.  The space is very pretty and comfortable bedding.  Only suggestion is to add more heating options.  It got cold at night even with front heating.  Space heater in back room was a great help.  All in all it was a wonderful stay.
13602723,87263368,2016-07-19,54532484,Sonya,Kate was wonderful! She gave accurate directions to retrieve the key and she was very understanding when I was arriving in the evening.

271647,50690034,2015-10-13,45304784,Seth,This room worked out pretty well for us as advertised. Matthew gave us a lot of information before check-in so the whole process was pretty easy.  Parking was better than most of SF and we could usually find a spot with in 3 or 4 blocks sometimes right across the street. Overall if you need a room to crash in with a shared common space this place is solid. Also walking to the beach is a huge plus!

I cannot wait to return if it is not too booked up once the secret is out x
72365,64782234,2016-03-08,33108914,Eva,"Eric war ein super Gastgeber und ich würde diese Unterkunft weiter empfehlen. Es liegt recht zentral und man erreicht alles  wichtige einfach. Das Apartment liegt in direkter Nähe zum beliebten Alamo Square und auch nicht weit vom Golden Gate Park und Panhandle Park - daher super für Jogger.
Für San Francisco Verhältnisse hat die Wohnung außerdem ein sehr gutes Badezimmer und ein hohes Maß an Privatsspähre - man hört seine Nachbarn nicht. Dafür ist zwar die dreispurige Straße vor den Fenstern viel befahren und etwas laut was man allerdings als einzige Lärmquelle gut hinnehmen kann. Wir haben zu zweit genug Platz in der Wohnung gehabt und uns wohl gefühlt obwohl es theoretisch sogar Schlafplatz für 8 Personen gäbe. Ich würde wieder in Eric's Apartment bleiben."

15051965,250056393,2018-04-03,21713913,Matt,Bassel's apartment is bright clean and in a very nice and comfortable part of the city.

This room has tons of character and would be our first choice of places to stay in SF when we come back irrespective of price. Although it's affordable you get a fantastic place and a great host. Thanks Josh!!!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to get to know San Francisco better while making friends. The keyless system is fantastic as well as the lecture  by a Berkeley professor we were lucky to attend in the venue itself!
We hope to return in the future and we’ll recommend this place to all our friends!
Look forward to having another ‘cuppa tea’ with David’s brilliant English accent while we get schnockered :)"

14775913,452293232,2019-05-12,3342641,Sherry,"We had a wonderful stay at Voytek's home.  The deck view is fantastic!  Inside it's very stylish clean and comfortable.  Level of comfort for beds and couches A+.  I really appreciated having towels shower necessities Keurig coffee and a sample of teas provided.  The kitchen itself is well-stocked with equipment and basic cooking ingredients like salt pepper cooking oil seasoning spices which I took advantage for making breakfast in the mornings.  
A peaceful place to enjoy after a full day of activities if that's what you're looking for!  Highly recommend this place and Voytek was very easy to communicate with.  Thank you Voytek!"
6629798,176370086,2017-07-30,2797094,Andrew,We loved it. Beautiful view and very well kept. We will be back!
1815551,20278929,2014-09-27,17053705,Phil,Sarah's place is in a fantastic location making it easy to get to transport and some great places on 24th to eat.  The apartment is clean and well equipped including some homely touches like books and games.  Nice quiet street in a friendly neighbourhood.  Sarah is easy to communicate with and makes you feel at home.  Would certainly stay again or recommend.
20803354,337863932,2018-10-17,39977754,Charlotte,A wonderful home with beautiful touches and amazing hospitality from Sion.
31852562,521252278,2019-08-31,247144098,Harrison,Jay's place is in the perfect location if you want to be close to downtown SF. It is a 10-15 minute walk from downtown making it the perfect place if you are working in the downtown area. The building is very secure and the amenities are great especially the rooftop pool - there is hardly anyone there during the summer months making it an awesome place to relax and hang out in the sun with views of the bay. The condo is a great size and is extremely comfortable. The condo was stocked with pretty much anything that you could need for a longer stay in the city and Jay was always very responsive whenever we had any questions or needs! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in San Francisco especially someone who is going to be here for a couple months at a time and wants to be close to downtown. This condo is a great find!
1456153,19311529,2014-09-10,14781672,Claus,"We stayed totally 4 nights in this house in San Francisco and found it accordingly to the description at Airbnb. The size was perfectly for our 2 children as well as our self.
 
The furniture of this house is really special and inspired us for our home as well. We have never slept with having around so much antique things before. This is probably not the right place to stay for people who have an ordinary home in mind but whoever likes to live apart from the mainstream will love it. 

The communication with Fred and Wendy was always perfectly. Whenever we had a question we have immediately received reply.  

Last not least especially the double bed in the upper floor was really extremly comfortable."
6006768,242921273,2018-03-13,21733775,Anna,We absolutely love Mimi and Mosh such kind generous and hospitable people! They went out of their way to make our stay was as comfortable and easy as possible. Mosh even voluntarily moved our car every few hours to avoid ticketing while we enjoyed the city.  The location is perfect and close to everything. Thank you for everything Mimi and Mosh!
2172308,547286862,2019-10-14,66613391,Caroline,"The place was nice clean and located in one of the nicest parts of San Fransisco we enjoyed being in walking distance of some of the city highlights but also a sneak peak of the daily life in the parks surrounding the house this was a good an safe area for the kids to hang out and play.
The kitchen was fully equipped and the patio had everything for a gathering with family enjoy the bbq and the sun. 
The house was small but had everything we needed.
The only bothersome thing were the skyhigh prices comparing to Dutch standards (house rental prices hotels sightseeing and groceries) 
The grocerie store around the corner (Molly’s) gave us two days of groceries for the amount we could buy food for three weeks in Holland. We found San Fransisco in general very expensive which is something to consider."
6938818,540065174,2019-10-02,252419688,Brogan,Perfect location with easy parking. Not a far drive to pretty much any attraction. Very clean with cute touches like coffee in the room a night light and a table and chairs for dining.
4519780,109011929,2016-10-18,59630729,Doug,I honestly was only there a few hours to take a nap. Seemed like a great place though 
2042095,326222917,2018-09-21,26317393,Johan,"We had a great stay at Bruce and Lawrence's place. As hosts they went beyond what we expected. The house is in in perfect condition and the neighborhood felt safe and friendly.

Bruce even picked us up at the Bart station and drove us to the local supermarket so we could get something quick and easy to eat.

Throughout our stay they would help us with places to visit sights to see and restaurants. Very appreciated!! We stayed there with our 3-year old son who just loved the place and especially Bert the very friendly dog."
9477823,234170355,2018-02-11,57307329,Joe,"Loved how quiet and clean the place is. Bedroom is spacious with large bed. Very nice to have the private bathroom. I found it easy to park my car in the street. 

Loved being just a little over a mile from the beach. Easy enough commute to downtown. 

Will want to return here when back in town for business."
715754,29595605,2015-04-10,4378185,Torunn,We stayed at Deb & Greg's apartment for five days and it was the perfect stay. The apartment has a great location and exceeded all our expectations. The view is amazing and the pictures don't do it justice - it has to be experienced. The apartment was of high standard - very clean with comfortable bed linings and towels and all the essential utensils and equipment. Deb & Greg also provided us with essential food and drinks to get us started and gave us the all information needed to start exploring SF. We highly recommend staying here and will definitely stay here again the next time we're going to SF.
348714,3468511,2013-02-04,1777655,Scott,"Great location in a tastefully appointed apartment. 15-20min to downtown SF on bus 21 and the stop is literally a 30s walk from the front door. Walk to Alamo Haight Ashbury and Golden Gate Park.

My little family of three stayed here for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We caught a cab to SFO from here which cost around $45 plus tip. You can get to the BART by catching a bus and then switching however the BART schedule did not match our flight times and we had too many bags. Driving a car here and parking it for the duration could be worisome due to availability of spaces though it is free.

The kitchen is simple and easy to use. There is no cooktop but the toaster oven and microwave do the job with a bit of planning.

This apartment is on the bottom floor so there is a bit of occassional noise from traffic upstairs however we did not find this intrusive at all.

George was friendly organised and easy to communicate with.

I recomend George's place for your stay in SF. 4 and a half stars!"
1525886,19761757,2014-09-17,16243857,Kord,Delilah and Karen were probably the best hosts you can imagine it was like staying at a friend's house. The location is great close to Mission and BART. Everything was clean and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. The two let us make use of their amazing roof top terrace with an amazing view over SF. if you're planning to go to SF you should definitely stay here.
848578,45953824,2015-09-07,6820077,Francois,"Delores is a great host. She answered quickly every time we had a request.
Everything is like in the pictures. Beds are comfy and we slept well. The place is in a quiet neighborhood and we had no issue finding a parking spot in front of the house."
21909473,552508756,2019-10-21,211339090,Danielle,My stay at Phyllis place was great- Phyllis was super helpful and communicative everything I needed got an immediate response! The place is clean comfortable and the location is great! I would definitely recommend it and will be happy to come back next time I'm in town!
27555509,363938149,2018-12-29,136152139,Phuong,Comfortable modern space with shared amenities. Parking is a challenge so use public transportation if possible. Jessica and Mark’s attention to details is evident in the space. Walking distance to bars and transit. Easy checking in and out. Highly recommend if you are in the city and want to experience Mission District.
33942157,502503988,2019-08-04,155817680,David,Great space and really central in the city!

21382398,508342096,2019-08-12,54575978,Kendra,The house was beautiful and has a great location! Nikki was very accommodating when updating the reservation and dropping off our bags prior to check-in.
16858141,245106457,2018-03-20,34656093,Nicole,Mein Freund und ich haben drei Nächte in der Unterkunft verbracht. Die Unterkunft lief über Sean mit dem wir aber keinen Kontakt hatten. Selah war diejenige die mit uns geschrieben hatte. Sie hat immer schnell geantwortet und war immer sehr hilfsbereit. Was nicht so aus der Beschreibung der Unterkunft hervorging war dass das Apartment wie eine kleine Jugendherberge ist. Vier Zimmer in drei können ca vier bis fünf Personen schlafen in einem zwei. Im unserem Fall war alles ausgebucht sodass wir uns die zwei Bäder mit zwölf anderen geteilt haben. Am Ankunftstag war alles schön sauber was sich aber schnell geändert hat. Unsere männlichen jungen Mitbewohner waren (wofür weder Sean noch Selah etwas können) leider auch zur späten Stunde ziemlich laut. Uns wurde noch vor Anreise mehrmals versichert dass die Lage der Unterkunft sehr sicher sei. Wenn man Einheimischen aber davon erzählt hat fiel aber jedes Mal der Kommentar: schaut dass ihr zu Hause seit bevor es dunkel wird bzw geht nicht aus dem Haus wenn es dunkel ist. Wir sind ein Mal erst gegen 22 Uhr nach Hause gegangen und müssen dem zustimmen. Dafür können Sean und Selah natürlich auch nichts. Wer gerne in Jugendherbergen unterkommt es aber auch gemütlicher mag und etwas fragwürdige Gegenden einem nichts ausmachen für den ist diese Unterkunft ideal. Denn das Preis-/Leistungsverhltnis stimmt. Für uns war die Unterkunft leider nicht optimal.
12270048,160084108,2017-06-12,118085614,JoAnna,Krystyna is a great host! She even left chocolates for us! The room was pretty and had a great view! Great stay!
13806046,400016698,2019-01-10,80149665,Jakub,I enjoyed my stay very much. Thank you so much for being such a great host!
5547500,324246212,2018-09-16,3263647,Caitlin,Had a great time! Home is as described and Jason and Ryan are excellent hosts!
1130628,19735286,2014-09-17,18019339,Delphine,The only good thing about this airbnb was the location.  The neighborhood was nice and we were close of everything.  BUT right before we arrived there was a flood next to our room and the carpet was wet Ashir did not notify us about the problem before we were in the apartment.  The smell was pretty bad. We slept in our sleeping bags and didn't touch anything...  Also the bathroom was really dirty (especially the shower!) This place was creepy I wouldn't recommend it. 
20813007,528805753,2019-09-13,81338932,Sophie,Great place to stay!
16456337,242700429,2018-03-12,75275351,Alison,Manny and Megan are great hosts. We stayed at their place for 3 nights and loved the experience.
7367530,51090177,2015-10-17,18283311,Mehul,Great experience! Central location and great hospitality. 
2274353,102431006,2016-09-18,85869546,Sunkyung,"Chris was a very nice and attentive host. House is spacious and clean throughout. Everything you need is in the house but if you need somethint extra just pm Chris on airbnb and he would be right at the door with things you need! 

One thing I suggest for people who are planning to rent a car MAKE SURE you park with cation!! Dont block the neighbour's entrance (not even a single bit). This happened on our last day and the neighbour was waiting outside and start screaming at us saying how he is so sick of all the airbnb guests staying at Chris kept blocking his entrance blahblah.. We apologized but he wont stop screming and we left feel all humilated. I hope this does not happen to anyone else.

Beside the parking issue we had a good stay at Chris!"
1907229,82881105,2016-06-30,71795893,Tim,"We had a great experience staying at Neeta's.  She was very communicative throughout.  Although she wasn't available for ""check-in"" her daughter met us and gave us an excellent introduction.  The beds were all very comfortable and the wifi worked well throughout the house.  Unfortunately it was a bit cold to enjoy the beautiful back patio.  Easy access to restaurants and just a shirt ride to the center of the city.  We'd stay there again."
14142409,152877427,2017-05-18,8817537,Brian,Steve's place was exactly what I was looking for to extend my business trip by a night and spend a little time exploring the Sunset district. It was easy to find incredibly clean and quiet despite being off of a major city thoroughfare. The location was great for a run to Ocean Beach and through Golden Gate Park as well as access to cafes bars and restaurants on Irving Street. Highly recommend. 
859336,23028213,2014-11-20,23459770,Nicolas,Anka's apt is really nice and she thinks about all the details even the slightest. The room is very comfortable. We have not met but she was in touch with me throug the app all the time. Thanks!
21192418,218945208,2017-12-15,76194597,Anali,10 out of 10 - cannot recommend highly enough! Not only was everything in the description accurate but the hospitality was truly touching. Just one example: when Helena found out that I had not felt well that day she insisted in making me (a delicious) soup! I felt at home.
13901641,112620256,2016-11-06,33060584,Alex,Quan was a great host! The room was very clean and quiet. Comfortable bed. We really appreciated her flexibility with it arrival time. Cute and quiet neighborhood with a lot of Asian influence. We enjoy some great Vietnamese food. Close to ocean beach and golden gate park. We'd stay here again!!
41423,45650607,2015-09-05,28015503,Steven,"The description of the house and neighborhood were accurate. Not much going on in Glen Park but a few nice restaurants and easy access to the BART are great. The host was friendly and relatively responsive.

Just a couple of issues:
1. The wifi was terrible. The host did replace the router however it never worked reliably and was a constant source of frustration. If you are only there for a short time this might not matter but since I was staying there for 12 weeks it had a very negative impact on my experience.
2. The small fridge was bad. Frost made the freezer completely unusable and the fridge itself was not able to keep things cold enough. Again probably not an issue if you aren't staying for a long period.

21594483,451431699,2019-05-11,37318655,Guilhem,Amazing place. Amazing Host! We had such a pleasant stay at Elena and Vasili's place.
4417901,179083603,2017-08-06,131800844,Kieran,Great place to stay in the middle of everything and a very social atmosphere. The only downside was the late night noise from some of the nearby bars but that was to be expected. Will happily stay there again if I am back in SF.
1925206,476232565,2019-06-25,2524275,Scott,"We had a good time staying at Joshua's place. We were grateful for the added extras after a late arrival such as coffee (Nespresso machine) fruit and packets of breakfast oats. The room was comfortable and there is a nice view out the back window to an outdoor patio area. There are great black and white photographs hanging on the walls all taken by Joshua. Although the upstairs area of the house is not part of the deal Joshua was fine to let us use the kitchen. Portola is an interesting area with a mix of people from all sorts of backgrounds.

Travelling into the city M-F is quite easy and fast using the 9R express bus from San Bruno Ave (10-minute walk). Make sure you download the Muni app on your phone and buy the new $5 day-pass for unlimited rides around town. Uber is also reasonable. About $22 to the airport and the same down to Fisherman's Wharf. For a very good local breakfast we'd suggest you give Breakfast at Tiffany's a miss and instead go to J. Georgie's Donuts and Hamburgers across the road. They've been there for 50 years it's half the price and the food is better. Make sure you rent bikes and do the Golden Gate Bridge ride down to Sausalito. Then take a ferry back to Fisherman's Wharf. It was a trip highlight. Book the bike online for a discount at San Francisco Bicycle Rentals (425 Jefferson St). They were excellent to deal with."
4728615,92628176,2016-08-09,29086979,Chloe,location cant be better. very european. small clean and quant. helpful staff. will stay there again.
687430,16338795,2014-07-26,232735,Lulu,Maria's is a great place to stay in SF. Her family are warm welcoming fun and go out of their way to make guests feel at home. Every week there were fresh baked goodies for us to enjoy. Their home's only 100 yards from a major Oriental supermarket and super-convenient for buses into central SF and other amenities. Another amazing thing about Maria's is the quality of the other housemates. People's food doesn't go missing and dishes always get washed. If you're going to SF stay at Maria's!
25356099,491164552,2019-07-19,265915004,Sai,Awesome place excellent and a very warm & welcoming host. Safe place to stay for families with kids
19240799,280614476,2018-06-23,558628,Gabe,Evelyn’s place was perfect. The apartment is spacious and has phenomenal views. Evelyn was flexibility’s with check in time despite an unexpected late arrival. Highly recommend!
2984463,295990428,2018-07-24,77756599,Brooke,Howard’s place was perfect for our stay in San Francisco. Having the private entrance and bathroom was a major plus. Howard was very responsive and friendly! He made us feel welcomed and comfortable at his home. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. The location was perfect we were able to use BART and Uber. If in San Francisco again I will definitely stay at Howard’s. 
12607119,170112608,2017-07-14,1105828,Gary,Julie's place is clean quiet spacious and attractive. It's also in a fantastic location that's right by gorgeous Golden Gate Bridge views as well as some cute shops and restaurants down the street. She had great communication and a nice welcome. Recommended.
28712636,465441086,2019-06-07,241249560,Sabra Hayes,Fantastic home in a great location!  Convenient to Golden Gate park and easy walk to Muni for downtown adventures. Very quiet neighborhood with lovely restaurants and small stores within walking distance. Hosts were wonderful - great suggestions for activities and very responsive with directions or responses to questions. We would definitely stay here again.
5631995,257335866,2018-04-25,43738720,Brandon,Anne was fantastic and an amazing host. Highly recommend .
53934,44749110,2015-08-29,26681461,Nathan,"We loved the stay in the Urban Rainbow Apartment. Manny welcomed us to the apartment and made us feel right at home.

Megan and Manny want to make sure that their guests have everything they need and are very warm and welcoming. They offer a lot of tips on what to do in San Francisco.

Check In and Out was totally uncomplicated.

The apartment is very clean and looks as advertised. It's near the City Center Tourist spots and Car Rental (Avis). You have the possibility to shop for groceries in the close Trader Joe's or grab a quick snack in one of the many little stores nearby. A lot of bars are also in the neighborhood.

The steet right next to the apartment is quite busy. Earplugs are probided by the hosts but maybe bring your headphones with some calming music.

But all in all a great experience!"
18810290,414096538,2019-02-18,13676783,Abigail,This home had everything we needed!  I slept on the sofa bed which was actually quite comfortable (firm but comfortable) and I really appreciated Eileen's direct note about the traffic noise because it was loud but because I already expected this it didn't bother us at all.  The dining room has a great afternoon sun considering you're on a lower level and the outdoor space looked great although we didn't get to use it.  Eileen provides everything you need to cook (spices etc.) and she even had every toiletry I may have forgotten (shampoo Q-tips lotions etc.).
6684182,483605677,2019-07-07,876691,Jarin,This is a very special place on a very special block in a great part of San Francisco.

Teşekkürler"
1725833,8331837,2013-10-26,2695809,Niall,Deborah is a great host with a fantastic apartment. She was very quick to sort any problems and assist in any way. I'd highly recommend staying at her place!
10235526,132588508,2017-02-18,39108735,Ross,Great place & good location. Didn't get to meet Lawrence but he was still super helpful and communicative. Place was well setup clean and very homely.
5548977,556528597,2019-10-29,66221133,Mandela,"Was the location great? Yes! We walked many places. Was the room cute? Yes! It was spacious and cozy all at once. Were the hosts clear and communicative? Absolutely!!! They made a wonderful little book of suggestions and were very thoughtful throughout the whole process. I can see why they have such high ratings. 

Unfortunately our experience was not as peaceful as some of the previous guests’ reviews suggest. As mentioned in the listing the hosts have children. However the listing (and subsequent private messages) downplayed their noise level. It was less “pitter patter of little feet”  and more onslaught of stomping and banging. On our first day it began early in the morning and it woke us up I assume before they went to school. I waited for it to stop thinking that I would go back to sleep but it went on and on and eventually we just got up and started our day sooner than we had planned. 
Around 4pm exhausted we went back to the room for a rest before dinner. Just as I was closing my eyes the kids came down to play in the garage which shares a wall with the room. They were playing some kind of game where they were literally banging against the wall the mirrors and pictures were shaking as we tried to nap. Again I though it would eventually stop but it did not. There was also quite a bit of shouting and crying. JUST on the other side of our door. Finally we just left. It was all too much. The beds were also hard and not easy to sleep in to begin with. It was an EXHAUSTING weekend.
I completely understand why it’s important to make sure your kids have a normal childhood have time to play etc. But as someone who spent quite a chunk of change to stay I would have appreciated having that info up front (I messaged the host in advance to ask about the noise) because I would have made another choice.
To future guests: if you are the kind of person who wants to get up early and stay out exploring the city all day this place will probably be perfect for you. But if you would like to lounge around and have a relaxing vacation that includes sleeping in I would make another choice. I’m really not trying to be mean the hosts are very nice people and the room is very clean and centrally located. This was just my experience."
27491569,341388155,2018-10-26,2692430,Thom,Great apartment in a good location for access to the city and South Bay. Plenty of helpful tips and advice for the local area and made sure things were as convenient as possible during the stay. The outside deck in particular was brilliant and the complimentary basket on arrival was greatly appreciated. Would very much recommend.
7073115,251327479,2018-04-07,35118412,LaDonna,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay here. It was very clean spacious and had everything we needed. I especially liked the large walk-in closet to hide away our luggage. Isaac was a great host. He was friendly and quick to respond to my inquiries. I especially liked how private the room was and the keyless entry. There is a bus stop steps away from his place and the shopping center is a 3 minute walk away with various shops and a few eating places. Although not near the ""touristy"" area I had no trouble traveling around via bus and MUNI. I will say there is a room right next door and the walls are a little thin so I could hear a lot. However overall it was a really nice and cozy stay and I would recommend it to others traveling to the area."
4902565,308564315,2018-08-16,14944199,Jordan,The place is great and has everything you need.  Clean and nice.   Check in is super easy and the location is good. 
17795712,407033069,2019-01-31,68458342,Katie,Clean simple space that met our needs for a quick trip to SF.  Harvey was very responsive and there is a tasty restaurant right across the street.
1206233,552918132,2019-10-22,118671542,Michelle,Ashirvadam’s place was beautiful clean and quiet! We enjoyed the location it was walking distance to several beautiful restaurants stores and streets. Other attractions were a short and inexpensive Uber ride away. Will definitely stay here again!
1470340,463705088,2019-06-03,230679479,Samantha,What a beautiful place! Our hosts were wonderful and we loved the garden seating area. It was a peaceful escape from the craziness of downtown. The neighborhood was welcoming and we felt very safe. Only a 20ish minute Uber/car ride to downtown. It was nice to be close but not too close to the hustle and bustle.
6006768,42846237,2015-08-16,26469776,Sofía,"Mimi and Mosh are great hosts they were really warm and friendly and gave us a lovely welcoming. Their apartment is perfect for a couple: confortable very clean and well equipped. And the neighborhood is a calm and beautiful residential area next to Presidio Park and Golden Gate Park.
Mimi and Mosh were quite helpulful and checked in with us every day to see if we needed anything. They gave us all kind of information about the city and even offered to move our car when we were away (there is a 3 hour parking limit). You can talk with them a lot (they are really nice) but without loosing your privacy. 
If we go back to SF we'll definitely stay with them again!"
11924237,75974308,2016-05-23,23999694,James,I had a truly wonderful time in Glen Park. The house is pretty quiet and bright and only a short walk from BART. It was really easy to get in and useful to be able to drop my bags there to explore the neighbourhood before check in time! I particularly liked the lemon tree by the bathroom window the fountain and patio outside for relaxing alone time and Canyon Market in the town. Eileen checked to make sure everything had gone okay for me by e-mail on the second day which made me feel welcome. As I am hopefully spending more time on the west coast through work I intend to stop by again.

Brian came to greet us right away and gave us some great options to check out. The view of the sunset was unbelievable and we would absolutely stay here again!

14884457,349187241,2018-11-16,156131961,Sabrina,Kina's home was awesome! It's very spacious and has a stylish homey feel. The home and the neighborhood is very quiet - making it a perfect stay for while I was a student. Kina was a great host by always quickly responding and accommodating to any questions I had. Check-in and out process was extremely easy. The house is in a convenient location close to the mall Target Whole foods Restaurants and Muni stops. The room is also very comfortable. Had no problems with sharing the common spaces with other guests. Would definitely recommend to another person!
31964427,523938536,2019-09-04,50872321,Jadelyn,Great space lots of room to be comfortable. Parking is rough but it is SF. Hosts were great with communication.

The area was quiet and safe with nice shops and restaurants nearby. Kate and her family were very welcoming leaving us tea coffee and tasty snacks as well as a handy guidebook. We were able to use their washer and dryer which was a huge help. The suite was beautiful and spotlessly clean. Thanks Kate! 
5027016,151067068,2017-05-10,18280385,Gus,Dans place is a nice clean place. It's in a quiet residential area. It has comfortable beds and AC/Heat which was very helpful. I enjoyed making my coffee with all the coffee supplies he has in stock and drinking it early in the morning in the nice backyard. I was able to find street parking both nights I stayed and after 11pm that is (compact car). 15-20 mins away from city attractions 5-10 mins away from the actual beach. 
22619139,296008157,2018-07-24,36200301,Rebecca,Great spacious place to stay. Apartment was clean large and totally updated with extra amenities.

14804950,113794382,2016-11-13,11187456,Sara & Jefri,We rented this studio for my husband's parents on their first trip to SF. It could not have been more perfect! Angela was very responsive easy to communicate with and accommodated an early check in. The studio has been renovated beautifully and Angela has so kindly included such extra amenities as an iPhone charger coffee/tea and local travel tips to make it feel like home. We would highly recommend!

ﾎｽﾄはとても丁寧でしっかりとされた方でした｡大満足です｡
基本的に移動はUber Xを使用していました｡
近くには薬局､ｽｰﾊﾟｰがあり､美味しいｲﾀﾘｱﾝ料理やﾒｷｼｶﾝ料理店がありました｡
家はﾋﾞﾝﾃｰｼﾞ好きにはたまらないﾃﾞｻﾞｲﾝで､まるで美術館に泊まっているような､そんな体験でした｡
またSFへ行くときはぜひご利用したいです｡"

148627,25459350,2015-01-16,18657072,Megan,Mark was very easy to communicate with and accommodating for our last minute request. His apartment is located so centrally it was very easy to walk around and very safe. Definitely enjoyed our quick stay in the city. Kitchen is fully equipped and there is a garage parking option which we really appreciated.
719431,269665104,2018-05-27,156068773,Jennnifer- Brooke,From the form to the function and above all the location- Phil and Su’s place was and is absolutely perfect. We could not have asked for nor wanted/needed a better place to lay our heads. A beautiful 3 minute stroll down their street and you can be anywheres in the city. A 10 minute walk up their street to Taraval will take you to an amazing breakfast spot called New Taraval Cafe. Amazing coffee spots on West Portal take your pick- we went to a different one each day.  
3122882,258828962,2018-04-29,27004083,Richard,The location was perfect for our visit. We were visiting our daughter who attends USF. The place was beautiful and we got the bonus of petting Tucker about the sweetest do in the world. Thanks for a lovely stay.
748222,232693817,2018-02-05,145342290,Bat-Ulzii,They are most definitely the best hosts. They went above and beyond to facilitate all of our needs. The room was very clean and all the amenities / common space made our stay very homey. The location was convenient and had many great nearby restaurants and it is a couple blocks away from the public transportation. The hosts also had great tips and recommendations. We felt like we were visiting relatives!
30355764,477684990,2019-06-28,2727719,Rakpana,Don’t miss Mirna’s place. She’s an awesome host. GREAT communication & QUICK responds.
23257392,311684532,2018-08-21,131671,Hoai,Nice large and clean room in a spacious apartment in the Mission. Private bathroom. Apartment is impeccably clean and modern. Room is at the front of the building but it's pretty quiet overnight. On a low-key street right near hip restaurants / cafes and of course accessible to the rest of the Mission and SF in general too. Definitely would recommend.
34345807,530447545,2019-09-15,69789350,Domi,The place was nice and clean. Marat is a good host but sadly we heard many footsteps upstairs the two nights we were there until late in the evening and early in the morning. Apart of that we had a good stay.
593253,153291573,2017-05-20,35318471,Christian,"When I arrived at Trevor's place I felt at home immediately. Not only is the house itself very nice but also Trevor his dog and the neighborhood were great. 

To me it was the perfect place to stay for my business and vaccation trip to SF because there wee many nice cafés and bars around for a good breakfast before I started the day or to get some dinner I could explore the whole city by foot or by the nearby N train station we had good conversations at home and if I had to get some work done I could do that too. I also want to note that the bed was very comfortable.

I will definitely stay at Trevor's place again during my next stay and I can recommend it."
1785463,243668461,2018-03-16,13501270,Haizhou,Great location and for sure will stay again

15270469,172718703,2017-07-21,103581833,Stephanie,"You are going to love this place! A great location right next to the park and walking distance to tasty restaurants like Tekka House. It's also really close to the public transportation if needed. You can catch a direct bus trip to the Golden Gate Park and visit the museums or Japan Tea House.

Will and his mom were super helpful and welcomed me to San Francisco right at check in. They make it feel like a home away from home. Will's mom even invited me to many home cooked dinners  during my stay and they all tasted fantastic. You won't find a better place in SF!!!"
7309852,334679949,2018-10-09,98953,Shomer & Judy,Maria’s apartment is clean neat and very comfortable.  The backyard patio porch is delightful.  The neighbor is quiet with the park at one end groceries and restaurants at the other.  A perfect location.  Check-in and communications were easy respectful and problem free.  We had a wonderful time would happily return.

We knew we were going to be comfortable and feel as if we were at home.  We loved his home and the neighborhood is awesome. He is an accomadating host always eager to help with directions and ideas of places to go he also loaded an app on my phone. Which was a big help. I would love to stay there next year. A big thank you goes to our super host.

23584006,293175512,2018-07-19,201840524,Michael,A small but very clean place with free coffee and tea. The bathrooms were clean as well. The walls are a little thin so it’s easy to hear what’s happening in other rooms but besides that it’s a really cheap and clean place and I’d recommend the room to anyone in the area looking for a room. 
23671363,451439631,2019-05-11,238138894,Russell,Great spot. Very clean and tidy room.

7856443,179144766,2017-08-06,131297911,Ken,The flat was very nice and spotlessly clean. We loved the location away from the more congested areas of San Francisco and within walking distance of Land's End. It is also very accessible  to the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin County attractions. Todd and Tatyana provided a folder with information on restuarants bus service etc. that was very helpful. We ate locally based on their recommendations and overall had the best meals we have had in 3 trips to San Frasncisco.
3030653,13198797,2014-05-21,10514485,Robert,Great host super clean and brand new place awesome area in SF with so many nice coffee shops restaurants and others in walking distance. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
32361583,500758618,2019-08-02,5737775,Leonie,We had a great stay at Thomas‘ and Ayu‘s lovely studio. Thomas and Ayu are super nice and welcoming. They always answered extremely fast and made sure that we feel comfortable at their place. They were also very nice and flexible regarding our check out.The studio is very pretty clean and located in a nice and safe neighborhood. The commute to the city is very easy by train. We definitely recommend staying at Thomas‘ and Ayu‘s. Enjoy :)
26339979,442095081,2019-04-22,167246438,Taylor,If you’re coming to San Francisco stay here! It’s absolutely gorgeous in a safe area and has all you could ever ask for in an airbnb if you’re in town to tour the city or for work! We are from Virginia and felt right at home even though we’re 40 hours away from our home! It was a great stay with many amenities that made our traveling so easy! When we’re back in SF we’re staying here again.
14773919,359698360,2018-12-17,147268436,Vladislav,Terry is an amazing host the place is great and the view will leave you breathless.
17237993,236634253,2018-02-19,172237233,Adam,Very cool room and house. Leon was away when we visited but the person who was there was really kind and friendly. She let us keep our bags there even after we checked out. The skateboard swing was definitely unique and pretty fun. It was an accessible location--easy to walk to stuff in the Mission although it's not as close to the main part of the Mission. Overall clean what I expected and an enjoyable visit :)
138592,42110112,2015-08-11,26300762,Adrian,Great neighbourhood great views and lovely house highly recommended.

4614763,556093316,2019-10-28,1737754,Jimmy,Del was a great host! She gave us a bunch of tips on things to do and was very nice and communicative. The place was spacious for a lair and has a lot of beds if you’re traveling with a family would be great. It’s right in the middle of the Mission district where we found some awesome Mexican food and culture. We were happy with our stay.
16700935,352723828,2018-11-25,215254000,Irma,I enjoyed my stay at Jeff's  place and found it to be a comfy environment just like home!  From candy on the table to a french press ( which I really appreciated as I use one daily)   the extra touches were great!  The bed was very comfortable  with plenty of pillows and the extra blanket and heater were used as I came up from SoCal and it was raining.   I will book with Jeff again as I felt safe and warm :)
2178509,141312633,2017-04-02,114976958,Marlon,"If you're planning a trip to San Francisco this is the place you should stay.
The house and the room are unbelievably comfortable The bed is one of the best beds I ever slept in and the bathrooms are vergessen clean.
You reach the centre of SF in about 25 minutes with the bus which departures a few footsteps from the house.
Also Gregg answered any questions in no time through the Air BNB App.

I definetly know where to check in the next time I'll visit San Francisco."
3718865,28654822,2015-03-28,20259744,Daniel,This place was perfect.  Very nice and comfortable.  Easy to get everywhere with public transit.  And Katie is such nice person and host.  
13641058,276100184,2018-06-12,17607892,Sandra,Joseph's place has become our go to apartment in SF.  The North Beach location is great for us.  Many yummy restaurants are within walking distance and the cable car is right out the front door if you need a lift out of the neighborhood.  We like the unique eclectic decor in the apartment.  Joseph is a gracious host and so prompt in his replies.  You will be happy you stayed here!

51773,2628824,2012-10-16,1103523,Bob,All was good in this stay and Jay was accommodating although I was rarely there during my 4 day stay because of commitments I had at a dance weekend event.  The house was quiet however and is in a wonderful location in terms of access to everything around the city and the park close by is an added plus.  The room is basic as indicated and worked well for me.
3727061,17897687,2014-08-18,19735010,Daniel,Absolutely delightful - from the great welcome and helpful advice to the super apartment! Thoroughly recommended.

18488036,491772307,2019-07-20,60688288,David,Wonderful location and very stylish furnishings. If you're bringing a car make sure to check in about your parking requirements and see if the hosts can offer you an M parking pass for your stay so that you don't need to stress about moving your car to avoid tickets/towing.
29906769,550966684,2019-10-19,49111881,Eric,Lovely stay in such a lovely part of town!

29038374,358265623,2018-12-13,10839288,Danaya,There are around 6 bedrooms and two shared bathrooms and a full kitchen. The private bedroom is spacious enough with a very comfortable bed. There was a lot of street noise from traffic but the host and other guests were all very quiet and respectful. Everyone I encountered was friendly.
10193457,174366012,2017-07-25,117923584,Tanguy,Logement très cosy mais je pense pour 2/3 personnes maximum. ..quartier très calme ...hôte très disponibles 
516836,7368137,2013-09-17,4934046,Giulianna,Fran's house is amazing. If you want to stay in a gorgeous clean home with stunning views from your balcony and a comfortable bed than this is the place. We felt at home right away. The room was great with a large closet and a awesome walk in shower in the bathroom. Potrero Hill is an awesome area we loved it. 5 stars!
1959880,113177602,2016-11-11,30625204,Justine,"Kristina s'est montré à la fois très accueillante et discrète. Elle nous a bien aidé quand nous lui avons demandé des informations et a pris le temps de regarder avec nous. 
La chambre et la salle de bains sont fonctionnelles et agréables. La seule critique est peut être que la chambre est un peu petite mais ce n'est pas vraiment gênant !
La situation de la maison est bonne. Le quartier est sympa il suffit de prendre le bus 67 juste en bas pour être au métro (environ 15 min de bus). 
San Francisco est une super ville pleine de charme et nous vous recommandons vivement le logement de Kristina !"
7514742,44337344,2015-08-25,15075107,Erick,First off I would have to say that thus was the best air bnb experience I've ever had.  John was courteous hospitable and very knowledgeable.  He provided us with breakfast every morning and went above and beyond to make our experience a comfortable one.  He also gave us great advice on which winery to visit which ended up being a great tasting and overall experience.  I would definitely stay at John's place again if I would be visiting sf again.  The place itself is a cozy two room which felt like home along with the backyard.  Both beautifully decorated and furnished. Highly recommend John and his place!
32477178,527365085,2019-09-10,21364943,Kornel,Nicely furnished cozy home. Perfectly clean room with its own bathroom. Communication with Eric is very smooth and he is really welcoming. From the location most of the landmarks and hyped places are easy to access with a quick uber ride.
351881,157392194,2017-06-03,99400725,Emma,Katie and Chris were great hosts. The room was just what I needed and it's in a great neighborhood. Chris even managed to get my super heavy suitcase up their stairs for me! 
1725853,23008564,2014-11-20,8136494,Karen,"Our host texted us right after we reserved their flat to make us feel welcome.  When we arrived he immediately met us at the door and told us about the flat.  He also mentioned that we could contact him anytime if we had problems.  Very welcoming.  
The description and pictures were quite accurate.  We did not have any ""surprises"" which was definitely nice.  
The neighborhood was nice because a grocery store was close as well as the transit system.  Our host had provided information about  these as well as other information regarding restaurants etc. in the area.  Also the neighborhood was fairly close to the beach.  "
14401326,315389077,2018-08-28,176339900,Lynne,Great house for a family to stay in bear in mind the bath room is off one of the bedrooms. Centrally located close to bus routes. 
15055277,515346273,2019-08-22,8396814,David,The room is rather cheaply furnished however if you’re just sleeping; it’s a great location. The TV didn’t work..
21125429,451382200,2019-05-11,90685875,Brittany,The stay was great! They were quick to respond the space was clean I felt comfortable and safe the entire time. Hosts were kind and helpful and accommodating to an early arrival.
727866,52693178,2015-11-01,33536594,Nicole,Esther and Kevin were amazing hosts and the location was perfect!  This was my first experience with AirBnB and I'm so glad it was with them.  The room was beautiful and well stocked...the pictures and description are very accurate.  They are right near the beach and there is plenty of parking nearby.  Esther had many great suggestions for sightseeing and places to eat and is so warm and welcoming.  And their sons are absolutely adorable!  I will definitely be booking with them again for my next visit to San Francisco.  Thank you Esther and Kevin!!!

Matthew is always helpful and friendly. The room is clean. Close to muni station and ocean. Almost everything is provided so we do not need to worry about laundry shampoo or other little thing. Even multi-head adaptor in the room. "

3309722,132064182,2017-02-15,8046776,Michael,Loved the location beautiful views and cozy quiet space. Close to the awesome Noe Valley neighborhood shops and restaurants.
1931763,164561571,2017-06-28,135908326,Jade,The four of us never felt so homey and comfortable. I loved the space a lot it was super close to everything and I couldn't ask for a better host.
5591544,224892755,2018-01-04,75088395,Maria Jose,Chris's place is beautiful! Location is great cool neighbourhood and two blocks away from BART station and close to good restaurants and shops. It is also beautifully decorated and clean WiFi works great there's beer and wine on the fridge and a super cool collection of music that we were welcome to. It was nice to get to live on a typical SFO house. There is a big staircase with 30+ stairs that you have to climb up so it is not for everyone and we could tell that dogs or cats live there so also not for allergic people but other than this I would definitely recommend! =) Thank you Chris!
2134475,154653522,2017-05-25,104138180,Roman & Juliane,Sehr freundliche Gastgeber. Das Haus steht in einer sicheren Gegend. Gastronomie und Unterhaltung ist fußläufig erreichbar.
28550959,494163330,2019-07-23,81369940,Jay J,John & Renato's place is very close to the Golden Gate Park. We went there everyday and there's a Whole Foods market Gus's market and nice restaurants like 1428 Haight Patio cafe etc. The room was exactly as described and actually it's bigger than I thought. A small back garden is a kind of surprise and I liked it so much. We'll stay their home when we visit again.
474107,227054902,2018-01-13,112856954,Egemen,Eventhough we were late in the day of checkin she waited for all she was always responsive and house was very nice

14934208,499019684,2019-07-30,139001123,Heather,"Collin is the kind of host one can only dream to find. He is polite respectful fun to talk to and incredibly considerate. His apartment is as described and within walking distance to everything- including the BART. Our stay with Collin was the best Airbnb experience we've 
 had thus far and plan to stay here in all future visits to San Francisco."
29874095,411525887,2019-02-12,15065931,Michelle,Lovely place — old Victorian style which just breathes charm and elegance :) I had a wonderful stay there and Keisha made checkin really easy with a lockbox and very clear communication.

And a koi pond!!! What's not to like? This place was great. "
2047469,220498106,2017-12-22,160001440,Xi,This place is wonderful very clean and cozy room. All guests are quiet and friendly. Kenix also brought us some croissants on the sharing room. Everything is tidy and convenient. About 10 bucks Uber pool for two people to Chinatown. Great location. Lovely town. Highly recommended
12797906,212020557,2017-11-15,1525608,Rodger,Nice clean and quiet place and very convenient to good dining and such. Would definitely stay there again.
21334,2473860,2012-10-01,2293050,Nick,Joe's loft has to be one of the most interesting weird cozy and wonderful private residences I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. It feels like part captain's quarters in a ship part cabin and heaven of interesting collectables. Highly highly recommended. Great view and close to the cable car! This is what airbnb is all about!!
38549454,559174764,2019-11-03,51348667,Jordan,"Great location and super cute space. Big rooms and very clean. 

Also amazing location in the city for the price!"
1633126,329415900,2018-09-28,61010549,Ann,Fesh's place is at the cusp of the city and is very residential. Without traffic it was about a 15-20 minute uber to the financial district which was nice because I was in town for a conference. The space is really cute and is a good amount of space for 1-2 travelers. Fesh's directions were great and he was always so quick to respond to any of my questions. Upon stepping into the kitchen you'll notice a little welcome basket filled with tea coffee wine beer and snacks. This was such a nice thing to do and was definitely really appreciated after hours of traveling. The space was a little dusty but I didn't mind and didn't bother to inform Fesh of it. I'm sure if I did he would have been on it. Overall I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town.
720811,439836221,2019-04-19,6904442,Cristina,Very cozy apartment!
1769688,332616243,2018-10-05,217584150,Vince,"Super clean place with a lot of great local restaurants to try within walking distance (just a couple blocks) of the front door. The Painted Ladies are a 10 minute walk away too to take in some iconic SF scenery. Don't let Rob down play how delicious Brenda's restaurant is!

For those coming for business it's about an 8 minute Lyft or Uber ride from downtown and to most offices. I was 15 minutes to and from the intl airport as well during non rush hour traffic times. 

This is a great place with a cool SF vibe."
439703,7950262,2013-10-09,7382383,Simone,super frendly hosts with lots of excellent recommentations how to send a wonderful time in sanfransisco witch dont find in a travelguide
581216,28566298,2015-03-26,7777701,Amanda,We had a terrific stay at Cathie's home in the lovely Marina District.  Though we arrived early Cathie was flexible by allowing us to park in the garage and explore the city until check-in.  She personally greeted us and answered any questions we had.  Her restaurant suggestions were excellent!  The flat is in a quiet neighborhood and close to many cafes and bistros.  I can honestly say one reason our visit to San Francisco was so enjoyable is because of where we stayed.  Cathie's flat is charming comfortable and well appointed.  We're looking forward to coming again.  Thanks!
32216182,436711033,2019-04-13,140220446,Laura,"Die Unterkunft von Hareg war sehr sauber und gemütlich. Die Lage war sehr gut. Das Zentrum bzw downtown könnte mit Bussen und öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln gut erreicht werden. Auch die Nachbarschaft war sehr nett mit vielen Restaurants und Unternehmungsmöglichkeiten.
Das Bett war sehr gemütlich und auch die Schlafcouch hat genug Platz geboten. Hareg hat uns genügend Trinkwasser und diverse snaks zur Verfügung gestellt. Auch Hygiene Artikel waren ausreichend da. 
Es hat uns sehr gefallen und wir würden wieder an diesem Ort einchecken"
21126147,205807273,2017-10-22,8778647,Shona,I had a great stay with John for a mix of work and leisure. He helped me with an iron and ironing board when needed and held onto my luggage for me on the last day so that I could enjoy the time I had before my flight. He was really quick to respond to all of my queries which was great when planning at such last minute! As a Brit abroad I would have appreciated a kettle in the room given there's not shared used of the kitchen. Otherwise the room is well equipped with a large and very comfy bed appreciated blackout curtains fast wifi TV with netflix and storage for clothes. Thanks John!
3549398,120325033,2016-12-09,104622064,Jorge,Living SF in a cool and friendly hosting! The best option! 
2984463,342476052,2018-10-28,113611661,Robert,Howard's place was great. very clean very easy to get to from the BART. Howard responded quickly at all times and was very helpful.

29874095,440360613,2019-04-20,60748156,Valerio,Beautiful period house with lots of character. Area as described although had no issues (was verbally harassed twice but both times in downtown SF). Conveniently located by the muni light metro rail - 30 mins ride to downtown.
1125079,81668930,2016-06-24,78094711,Judson,Thank you for a wonderful experience.  The room was clean the view was great.  My only regret is that I didn't get to meet the wonderful Lulu ... maybe next time.  Highly recommended.

31447415,483807289,2019-07-07,48110385,Ganesh,We had stayed at an AirBnB last year in SFO in the same Sunset District. So we knew what to expect. However Quannan and Hua's place was better than our expectations. It was spotlessly clean had newer facilities and we could park our car in the garage (and not have to bother about street parking rules). It is a quiet residential neighborhood within a short distance of Golden state park eating places and stores. It is conveniently located within a 20 mins drive to Golden Gate bridge or Presidio.
10592126,163961824,2017-06-25,6985446,Julie & Jeff,Jenna's home is the perfect place to stay.  She has thought through every detail of what makes her travelers feel comfortable.  THe apartment itself has lovely views of the city and you feel as if you are in a upscale penthouse suite! The neighborhood is great and we found that we were never more than a $20 Uber/Lyft ride to anywhere in the city.  We would love to come visit again!
11242172,90849299,2016-08-02,81828494,Tamsin,"We booked for 3 people (my husband me and our daughter) and got 2 good sized double rooms with queen beds with a private seating area and shower room.  This was much bigger than I expected from the photos.  You share a kitchen outside which does mean you get all the kitchen smells.  It was lovely and clean though and Jade was easy to deal with and very welcoming.

It is quite noisy as in the center of town but with earplugs and eye mask we were fine!

I would stay here again as it is good value compared to the hotels and a great central location."
2274353,75475588,2016-05-21,67978332,Xiaoyu,Chris and Tina have been very helpful and responsive the place is clean and lovely.
7275084,207763123,2017-10-29,18262203,Robert,Zimmer Bad Vermieterin und das sagenhafte Frühstück - alles einzigartig. Hier möchte man eigentlich sofort dauerhaft einziehen.
568161,276123306,2018-06-12,77368888,Rosalind,This is an incredible home to stay in. Being a guest here is like being a member of an interesting and generous family where your independence is taken for granted and being included is a given. The neighbourhood is a complete delight the food/ bookstore/ live music in said bookstore/ BART one block away; everything is just so beautiful and easy. This is a GEM of a family and a wonderful special place to stay. Thank you so much for being a part of my journey no finer beginning could have been written. 
34601638,515986640,2019-08-23,2433342,Sarah,Really enjoyed staying at Esmeralda's. It is in a very safe part of SFO and it was in a great location for early morning photography and access to public parks. The room is large with great styling. You have access to the main kitchen and laundry and it is only a single flight of stairs walk up. The bed is very soft so if you prefer firm mattresses this might not be for you but I really couldn't be more positve and happy with this find. Not to mention it is great value for SFO. Highly recommend.

8351923,243103321,2018-03-14,15830453,Genevieve,A return trip to Michelle’s place because it was so nice.  Pretty quiet clean with a comfy bed and a good shower.  Entry is easy with key code locks and we enjoyed the chocolate biscotti in the kitchenette!
21203146,226099509,2018-01-08,37610907,Nadine,"It was a wonderful stay! I would give 6 stars if I could! :)
Best AirBnb I’ve ever stayed at especially given the incredible value.
A wonderful and professional young girl checked us in and brought us additional towels and drinks when she saw the room was going to be full.
The room is beautiful and modern and we enjoyed the patio in the back as well.
I will definitely recommend your place to friends and family visiting SF and will choose to stay there in the future!"
1005642,56351442,2015-12-12,50813463,Brett,Jan made me feel very welcome and has a nice cat. Place is close to some nice attractions.
6970746,54453559,2015-11-20,4297789,Tienyu,Laurie and Rebecca have a beautiful home and I felt privileged that they shared it with me. The reservation process was smooth and Laurie and Rebecca proactively reached out to ensure that I had no issues finding their home. The room was very clean and comfortable and Laurie and Rebecca were friendly and helpful hosts. The location is amazingly convenient and even though I've been a regular visitor to San Francisco over the years I felt that I had a truly unique experience on this trip. Hope to be able to visit again and definitely highly recommended to other travelers.
17551632,161742297,2017-06-18,111440461,Lana,"Susanna's flat is really great we had everything we needed and more. Just like in a hotel. 

It's really close to downtown BART staiton is about 7 min away and you have only 3 stops to get to city centre. 

And Susanna is the best host she is so nice and friendly and always available. She gave us lot of recommendations which were great. 

If you're going to San Francisco book this airb'n'b :) "
31888526,427039990,2019-03-22,105516440,Michelle,Safe location perfect size for two people! We stayed a week and had zero problems could not have been a more perfect spot for us in the city. Anything we needed was already there food in the area was great and a reasonable distance/price. We loved our stay!
41423,222653,2011-04-11,379705,Amy,"This is the PERFECT location for someone who prefers to be out of the ""touristy"" area of the city. A nice quiet place to come back to at the end of the day. Glen Park also has a couple great coffee shops and restaurants and an organic market if you prefer to eat in the cottage."

11437509,539177455,2019-09-30,113622638,Nathan,This place is clean comfortable and convenient. It is a close walk and or bus ride to any activity downtown while staying quiet at night. I would love to stay here again
1470340,267802284,2018-05-22,121378034,Lori,This was a really great place - we enjoyed our stay very much. Gustav & Nataly were the best hosts and very helpful with how to navigate SF and also very quick to respond to questions. The place is very nice and we were right at home there. Thanks!
16519220,423620703,2019-03-14,5260478,Mary,Exceeded all expectations. The bed was beyond comfortable the apartment is serene and stunning and the street is safe and quiet. The WiFi is speedy and it was nice to have the whole place wired with Sonos. The kitchen is stocked with every tool imaginable so it was nice to be able to use all the gadgets when cooking. Communication was quick and thorough. Would happily stay here again.
4654218,69051260,2016-04-08,22178444,Caro,This room was as described. The space is tidy and the bed was comfortable. It was unseasonably warm when we visited and Jack went out of his way to accommodate us with a fan. As an older townhouse the temperature seems to fluctuate between the rooms and the walls are quite thin. Jack is an attentive host and likes to stay in contact with his guests. 
20059569,221803273,2017-12-27,14350734,Andreas,Rummet var som förväntat. Bra sängar gott om rena handdukar. Wifi fungerade dåligt på rummet. Bra läge! Nära till mysiga caféer bra matställen och lätt att ta sig in till stan. Tar cirka en timme att promenera till Union Square och en timme för att promenera till Golden Gate.
9495318,435524728,2019-04-10,248901417,Celeste,Great hostel in a wonderful location!  Highly recommend :)

4959980,112186737,2016-11-04,931047,Zach,Enjoyed staying at Tali's place. A great 2B option for ocean side of SF. Super easy checkin/out and convenient location.
4614763,329796932,2018-09-29,168340612,Kristina,The house was as described and very clean. Del was a lovely host and very engaging. She had lots of good local knowledge and was able to point us to great parks for our kids. She also has a garage space for rent which is convenient if you don’t want the hassle of street parking. I would stay here again.
4387067,550986389,2019-10-19,25468504,Sara,"Great location friendly hosts!
The neighborhood felt very safe. This private suite is up a long flight of stairs and has a bay window overlooking the street below. It’s shared with 2-3 other private rooms. We heard other guests coming and going but did not see them as there are no shared common spaces aside from the stairs. 
The room itself is comfortable and stylish with an equally lovely bathroom. It has two large closets which were nice to stash our luggage and keep the room clutter-free. 
We were able to find several delicious breakfast locations within easy walking distance and could easily get anywhere we wanted with a $10 Lyft ride (ie. Embarcadero and Hamilton were our main destinations)
Our one very small comment is that we did not find the bed as comfortable as others have mentioned. Be aware my husband and I are extremely picky about beds and greatly prefer foam mattresses and this one was not foam. That said I would give the mattress itself an average review. Nothing special. Everything else was exceptional."
6505426,186511459,2017-08-24,5612094,Kelly,While we didn't get to meet Jeff his communication was always prompt and easy. His partner Huib was super accommodating and made it easy for us with our luggage and feeling welcome in their wonderful home. Eager to help and answer questions these are amazing hosts! Space was perfect for the 3 of us traveling together and easy enough to access main parts of town. Uber share makes the rides as cheap as the bus!
17576074,334676591,2018-10-09,170242170,Martha C,"Igor is respectful excellent and understanding host. He allowed me to check in very early. Thank you Igor.
Comfy bed. Good place to stay if you just want to sleep there at night and go to the city during the day. Cheap Uber to go to the city."
27729286,320389719,2018-09-08,178700,Shannon,Gorgeous place great neighborhood amazing host. Loved the stylish but cozy interior with terrific treats tucked here and there. Clean! Holly was a lovely host made check in a breeze and pointed out all the great spots in the cute hood. Will definitely return when back in SF!
13845578,292717490,2018-07-18,40976123,Patrick,"Lance has a wonderful little (but not so little by SF standards!) guest house just south of SF downtown. Very contained and private nook with a luxurious hot tub. I visited with my wife and we were both quite impressed by the space and it’s value.

Definitely hoping we get to stay there again sometime!"
12522,103427811,2016-09-22,26746533,Lopa,The house is conveniently located with public transport very nearby. The area felt safe and the house was very clean and tidy during my stay. Additionally Brenda was a wonderful host and communicated all the necessary information. She was available to help if I had any questions. I would highly recommend staying at Brenda's house.
22487945,554617087,2019-10-26,213014494,Philip,Great spot!
929468,3934047,2013-03-28,5588360,Josh,John was an great host. We arrived later than we had planned and John was there with a smile to get us settled in. The studio was even nicer than we had hoped and located in a great neighborhood with easy access to everything we needed. Next time we're in the city we want to stay at John's Castro studio.
4287481,356597028,2018-12-08,4999497,Sophie,Good location beautifully clean apartment with comfortable king size bed nice linen good shower. Fabulous and friendly hosts who went out of their way to be helpful. I would stay here again in San Francisco.

8685570,56919613,2015-12-20,46640598,David,"Not clear from the title ""Union Square Dorm"" this is in the Spaulding Hotel 6 floors of rooms above the main entrance. The location is perfect for Union Square & Market Street shops restaurant a direct cablecar to Fisherman's Wharf and BART. The mattress pillows & linens seemed new and were excellent but the room was the most simple & bare I've seen in a very long time. There was a manual-control water radiator by the window for heat but no provision for cooling except to open the window. The single-pane windows don't block much of the street noise. There's no place to hang clothes except a hook on the bathroom door; no hanger bar or hangers in the closet; no dresser and just a board on L-brackets mounted to the wall for a desk. But the wifi had good signal there's a TV on the wall and the room had its own tub toilet & sink. The staff were always present helpful and responsive. "
4365969,210475347,2017-11-09,17272229,Erik,I stayed at Leslie's while I was attending Dreamforce and couldn't have asked for better accommodations. She greeted me upon my arrival made herself available at all times and genuinely cared about my stay. I'd love to come back!

4077186,123529016,2016-12-29,30021224,Kevin,"I think a previous reviewer mentioned that the apartment suffers from significant road noise. This was accurate even for an urban location it was very noisy. The unit is located on a very busy roadway including a bus route. There is a major intersection just after to unit on the same side of the street which amplifies the noise from start/stops of cars and buses. The unit actually shakes significantly when the buses go by at all hours of the day/night. This fact should not be minimized by Danielle in her responses to reviews as they are very fair criticisms of her unit.
Couch was different color than in picture.
Some of the towels had holes in them like they had been eaten by an animal or burned??  Certainly not expecting towels with holes."
31443023,446517648,2019-05-01,245356448,Stuart,Very hospitable and quick to respond to any message.
516836,3431816,2013-01-28,616545,Morten,"Staying with Fran is always great. She was not at home and trusted me with her master bedroom which is just wonderful and very comfortable. Fran has a great interior decoration style was very responsive when I had questions and although being remote was always approachable.
I stayed at her place while other guests were at her property and really enjoyed the interactions with them.
Overall I can very much recommend staying at Fran's place."

4305042,135334249,2017-03-04,22045731,Seanté,"Joel & Mel are exceptional hosts. Not only is their guest space well equipped it is also a much needed quiet peaceful escape from the madness of downtown San Francisco. I saw a few mentions about privacy in other reviews- I had all of the privacy in the world during my stay. The bedroom is spacious and has ample storage for your belongings. 

Personally I wish I had more time to spend on the deck and in the living area. I'd imagine it's beautiful in September when it's warm out in SF. The kitchen is fully stocked with utensils wine chocolate and water. This is by far one of the best Airbnb's that I've stayed in so far. I highly recommend it and will look to stay here again for future visits. Thank you!"
23171836,276447024,2018-06-13,143148215,Sophie,we absolutely loved our stay at Szes Airbnb. It was very clean and the kitchen was well equipped. We would definitely stay there next time!
21799941,261673208,2018-05-06,424310,Marc,There are not enough great things that I can say about Julia and her place! She was the most accommodating host with an attention to detail and deep thought behind every amenity that she provides her guests. Her place is spectacular in an amazing location with a quintessential SF feel. My wife and I instantly felt at home in her place. Julia herself was very easy to communicate with and gave us tons of suggestions for restaurants bars and places to sight see and experience. I highly recommend her place and we look forward to staying there again!

2233416,239431259,2018-03-01,4894739,Duncan,We moved to SF from the UK and spent the first month at Melise’s great apartment. From beginning to end Melise was really responsive and went out of her way to accommodate everything we needed (including after our reservation was over!) There were lots of nice touches to make us feel at home. The apartment has lots of light and is very well located for the water parks groceries and short walk to Union and Chestnut streets. The apartment is well appointed throughout with updated kitchen and bath and very comfortable for a long-term stay. We would have stayed longer if we could!
767506,24534889,2014-12-30,17609035,Jim,Jennifer was out of town with her family so we never actually met but nevertheless she was in frequent communication to make sure we had all we needed to get settled in. The instructions on local surroundings were thorough and very useful. The house was perfect for our group of 6; clean spacious and in a location that was close enough to sample the various SF flavours without having to endure some of the more extreme realism of downtown.
31206489,553669554,2019-10-24,31985039,Gonzalo,Nuestra estancia fue muy cómoda. La entrada es autónoma lo cual te da más libertad. El hecho de que el baño fuera compartido no fue problema porque en caso de necesidad pueden usarse los otros como ya señala Craig y en nuestro caso no tuvimos que esperar casi nunca. Todo estaba limpio y bien. La habitación es muy acogedora; la cama comodísima. Está muy bien situada el barrio es tranquilo y cerca hay sitios agradables para desayunar.
479072,494105103,2019-07-23,103593371,Gabriela,Communicating with Viola was really easy. We were able to drop our bags off earlier than check in time. Grant was great in welcoming us.
2115503,106702412,2016-10-07,20608759,Courtney,Great stay for four nights...really easy check-in with a lot of information provided. The location is an easy walk to the ocean hiking trails Golden Gate park and a Safeway plus some other restaurants. It's also easy to get a bus downtown or an Uber to get where you need to go. The kitchen has everything you need to cook. Overall the place was clean comfortable and easy to find. Would definitely consider staying here again. 
15705696,546671308,2019-10-13,26996514,Evan,Had a fantastic stay at this very cool Outer Sunset space. Easy check-in surprisingly spacious accommodation (including access to a beautiful backyard and deck) and great location especially if you like being removed from the bustle of other parties of the city.  I hope to have the chance to stay here again.
8739,245088481,2018-03-20,3656927,Clemens,My parents had a fantastic stay at Ivan and Wendy's place; the place was as described and Ivan and Wendy were great hosts. Would gladly stay there again.
22229654,318414755,2018-09-03,15445893,Christina,Comfortable place to stay. We just stayed for one night and we really didn’t spend much time there except to sleep. But it was nice to have our own entrance great that the 2 bedrooms were separate and the bed and sofa bed were comfortable.
2115503,188249905,2017-08-28,139180283,Geoffrey,Nice clean unit in a good location close to the beach and Golden State Park.
900393,21332008,2014-10-15,4365821,Stacy,This home is a gorgeous in person as it was in the photos. The location was convenient to busses grocery stores tasty restaurants and even a brewery! The views were breathtaking and well worth the climb up the hill. My son slept comfortably in the provided crib which made this place perfect for my family.
16256179,132913833,2017-02-19,29122280,Victoria,Beautiful home! the upstairs terrace had a great view the hot tub was a nice addition and there was enough room for everyone in the house. Overall would definitely stay here again. 
3325741,185842027,2017-08-22,58970058,晓佳,It's very clean. Thanks to the Robert and Juan Carlos.
585225,25610441,2015-01-20,10173867,Mike,My girlfriend and I stayed in this wonderful space for two nights.  The proximity to the MUNI made it perfect for exploring the city without having to stay close to the action.  Gabriel made it easy to get the key and leaving was only hard because we wanted to stay longer.   When I come back to the city this would be a top choice for sure.  
216064,684410,2011-11-01,1332202,Jennifer,"My husband and I took a weekend vacation to SF along with our little 6-month-old baby Zachary and we chose Angela's place to stay. This was our first airbnb experience. Our two-nights was not enough! We felt very welcome in her home. The accommodations were exactly as described. Her husband made us an amazing Indian breakfast sort of an oatmeal-type meal made of basmati rice daal coconut milk and a natural sugar...mmmmm! They were SO KIND to prepare breakfast for us especially given our vegan/gluten-free requirements (not any easy task.) My husband's GI system never travels well and he'd over indulged in dinner the night before so he felt very bad turning down breakfast due to his upset tummy. :-( I should have told them the night before that there would only be breakfast for one in the morning.

Their 8-year-old daughter was a delight. I liked chatting with her at breakfast about her school and Halloween costume.

We had no problem hopping the nearby bus to any part of the city we wanted to go to. A 15-minute bus ride landed us near a fun shopping area (near Mission and 20th) and three delicious vegan restaurants (the whole reason we wanted to go to SF to begin with!) Angela recommended one Cafe Gratitude which was amazing.

When it came time to leave Angela's husband insisted on giving us a ride to the BART. It was very nice of him and we appreciated it so much. Traveling with a baby and all the gear is never easy. :-)

My husband and I felt transformed after leaving Angela's. The positive energy in their home is inspiring. We especially enjoyed our conversations with her husband about his previous life in India. He has such insight and a clear mind. Family values run strong here. We will certainly stay again!

8195144,401974747,2019-01-16,5724577,Shawn,"My wife an I had a great visit to SF. The check-in at Elena's was clear and easy and the apartment was clean. We had a rental car so we were thankful to find plenty of parking spaces available. It's a very quiet neighborhood with lots of cute well maintained houses.

The weather was quite cool and pretty rainy during our stay. We did have to communicate with Elena in order to keep the apartment at a comfortable temperature for us. Elena informed us that the furnace was on an auto-timer set to run only late at night but she was able to accommodate our requests to run the heat at other times.  Guests should be aware that there is no thermostat control in the apartment but Elena is easy to communicate with via AirBNB messages."
26709189,540552227,2019-10-03,197020,Mike,"Great stay at Tom's place - this is a stylish modern centre city apartment with great skyline views and high quality finish all through. 

The neighbourhood is a little ""up-and-coming"" being right by the Tenderloin but I didn't have any problems during my stay at all and it's super central and right by a Bart station for easy transit. 

Thanks Tom!"
1725853,46101412,2015-09-07,23955542,Sarah,Alex was very welcoming and made sure we had all the information we needed to settle in. It is a beautiful apartment - the photos for the listing don't do it justice! Overall a great first time airbnb experience :)
7180020,68673793,2016-04-06,5832852,Andrew,Our hosts made us feel very welcome and we really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was fully equipped we had everything we needed (and more) and was walking distance from Union Square.
29593658,450932773,2019-05-10,43030714,Tanya,A great home base to explore the city.  Megan is a wonderful host and made sure we knew all the best places to be.  Plus she made sure we had a great cup of coffee to start our first day in San Fran.

Great place!  Very clean and very nice hosts.  Would definetely recommend the apartment."
256176,11323885,2014-03-30,4909787,Dragica,The room was very nicely furnished and really comfortable things were chosen with care and nothing was flimsy. Everything worked as expected the internet which was very important for me because I was on a business trip worked without a hitch. The private entrance was very convenient and I loved the view out of the backdoor to the soccer field. The street was very old San Francisco and there where coffees and supermarkets in walking distance. The streets were quiet enough so I could bike around. I only saw Eva at the end of my stay because I was mostly out but everything worked out per email without any problems. 
2539953,19600465,2014-09-15,4667698,Allison,The house is beautiful and very kid friendly. My nephew loved the playroom on the top floor. Olivier was a great host and there were nice little touches throughout such as the cooking supplies. Only downside is there's no bathroom on top floor near the king sized bed but there is one the next floor down. Overall very happy with the experience!
4614763,452727669,2019-05-13,9316658,Tammy,Lovely apartment perfectly clean. Great communication. I would stay here again.
21327857,255199360,2018-04-19,124776315,Kevin,It felt like I had my own 1 bedroom apartment or a suite at a hotel. Lot's of space and close to downtown SF. I walked a few blocks to 3rd St for a good beer and tri-trip. Potrero Hill is a lot nicer than places near Market St or Union Square.
631735,305108102,2018-08-10,37233747,David,When you stay here you're like family.

4902063,126532291,2017-01-12,47326375,Chizuko,It is a great location near Union Square.

16043093,420790890,2019-03-07,5396377,Polina,This was most amazing AirBnb place I've ever been to! Stacy's apartment is really thought-through to have everything you need while your stay. It's perfectly located close to Sutro Baths and Golden Gate Park and very well-maintained.  We were so comfortable there we didn't want to leave :) Stacy was very sweet and helpful she brought us milk and even helped us out with sending postcards. I really will miss SF and staying in this apartment. Hint: for best breakfast in town go to Loui's or Zazie.

In the apartment everything was perfect for a couple with all the necessary amenities and more. We liked the stylish touches and it was all very clean. We highly recommend this place.

862201,262397661,2018-05-08,27233011,Madie,Jojo was such an attentive and accommodating host. Always quick to reply to any questions we had. The unit was very clean stylish and well appointed. The location was perfect. Great neighbourhood close to downtown / major roads and lots to do in the area.
4695477,544296877,2019-10-09,279815779,McKenna,The cottage is so cute and clean. The location is great for exploring the city. We loved being able to walk across the street to Golden Gate Park. There are many restaurants nearby that are easy to walk to. The public transportation is close by so getting around without a car was very easy. We loved our time here!
748222,150331235,2017-05-07,113417896,Mike,"Pro:
Die Gastgeberin war bei Ankunft sehr hilfsbereit routiniert und kommunikativ was die Einweisung und Tipps für Ausflugsziele usw. betraf.
Die gesamte Wohnung war sehr sauber und alles bestens organisiert. 
Gute Dusche / sauberes Bad.
Die Lage ist sehr gut um den mission district zu erkunden oder via Bart in die City zu gelangen (ca. 5 min laufen dann 10 min fahren) 
Ein Supermarkt ist keine 5 min. entfernt.
Die Dachterrasse bot ein schönes Plätzchen jedoch nicht in so guten Zustand wie die Fotos suggerierten.

Contra: Das Zimmer selbst ist relativ klein. 
Als Paar mit Kind und Gepäck war es uns eine Spur zu eng.
Das Bett ist für größere Personen ab ca. 180-185cm nicht besonders geeignet weil zu kurz. Die Matratze empfanden wir als miserabel.
Das TV im Wohnzimmer der Gastgeber war am Abend durch selbige besetzt.
Das Zimmer lag direkt an Eingangstür/Wohnzimmer/Küche mit den entsprechenden akustischen Begleiterscheinungen....

Neutral:
Die garage direkt unter dem Haus war sehr praktisch (Autofahren in SF ist eine erfreulich entspannte Angelegenheit) allerdings stehen noch 2 weitere Fahrzeuge in der Garage - mit einem Full-size SUV dürfte das einparken dort sehr schwierig werden...

Fazit: beim nächsten mal würde ich für das Geld möglicher Weise ein Zimmer im klassischen Motel/Hotel mit Parkplatz und eigenem TV und Kühlschrank vorziehen."
13293285,341753934,2018-10-27,221465465,Brandi,Tiny studio was very clean and comfortable. Had everything we needed and hosts even provided snacks coffee and bottled water. Good location quiet and felt safe. Perfect for one or two guests. Would stay here again.

The house is well prepared for everything. 
It is spacious for me and my wife and the rooms are clean.
Some peoples worried about Tenderoin area But it's peaceful and Post street(upper street) is good.

Annette paid for the hotel fee gladly.

Annette is a great host.

4897143,50957309,2015-10-16,18788252,Yigitcan,One word...Perfect! I' ve been to many hostels around the globe and can say Green Tortoise is one of the cleanest and most welcoming hostels. Bathrooms were clean no matter what time it was. And people at front desk were always helpful from shuttle reservation to bike rentals. Thank you guys! I will be back soon :) 
18140914,356010536,2018-12-06,35149173,L.M.,Sandhya's place was so cozy and close to everything. Great location and hospitality!  Would highly recommend.

2063077,40209218,2015-07-29,32320186,Anita,This was our first time trying out Airbnb and we really enjoyed Caseys house and her hospitality when in SF. The house was perfect for our stay in SF with two kids. Much more practical than staying in a small hotelroom downtown SF. The kitchen was well equipped we only eat breakfast there but could have made lunch or dinner there as well. Our youngest boy really enjoyed the toys in the childrens room. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet. Casey had left some brochures about things to do in SF a map with recommendations about where to shop and eat near by (in the Glen Park area) which was very helpful for us coming from abroad:  The pizza at Guiliana was good and shopping fresh vegetables and groceires at the nearby marked was very practical. We had a car and could park in front of the house. Having a car was very practical when travelling with kids we went downtown SF at daytime (parking there was not as difficult as we had thought) could come back to the house for a break before we could go downtown or to the Mission for dinner at the evening. Would really recommend going to Muir Redwood Woods and the Muir Beach approx 45 min-1 hour by car from the house depending on the traffic. I would really recommend staying at Caseys house we did not meet her in person but communicated by textmessages and email and everything went very smooth! 
968852,11066383,2014-03-18,7136301,Andrés,We enjoyed our stay at Cai's place she is very helpful and a kind host. The place is beautiful exactly as the pictures. The neighborhood is perfect a lot of places to eat drink shop and take pictures. Definitely recommended to future guests.
4720512,139893665,2017-03-26,68104953,Evan,Great coffee shops around the corner and we loved how close to Golden Gate park it is. It's a quite place and the other people living in the place kept to themselves so it felt like the place was all to ours. Clean and comfortable. What more could you ask for!?
13788749,91253969,2016-08-04,31372977,Scott,Kandle was very helpful and went out of her way to meet us so we could to drop off our bags prior to check in. She's fun to talk with and can give you great information on the city.  The room was clean and the bed was comfy.  It's a good place to bunk as we spent most of our time out and about.

13735115,421166048,2019-03-08,7860659,Kathleen,Celia’s place is stunning. Her home was stunning and so incredibly designed. We felt so welcomed into her life and her home. Her kitchen and dining room was equipped with every utensil and dish you could ever need for hosting a dinner! Celia was so wonderful and easy to get a hold of she helped me with everything I needed to make our stay amazing. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone who is looking to host their friends and family in a stylish space in SF :) Thank you Celia!

1931763,55737935,2015-12-05,150132,Emerald,I had a pleasant stay at Matt's place! The keyless entry makes it easy to come and go and the room is spacious. One of the nice touches is that the mini fridge is stocked with flavored water and energy drinks. If you're looking for a place that is centrally located in the Mission and want privacy this is the listing for you!

10280888,526966223,2019-09-09,125363240,Monique,Great place would definitely stay there again when in San Francisco.
909063,8110397,2013-10-16,7324628,Reed,Mark and Rafael were simply the best hosts one could ever expect. They have to be about as good as it gets with AirBNB. I had a great stay and felt welcomed and comfortable from the moment I arrived.    The bed and bedroom were beautiful comfortable clean and private.  The room is large with a comfortable sitting area including a table and two comfy chairs.  There is plenty of space for your stuff and lots of beautiful art everywhere.  The place is just as amazing as in the pictures!  It is super close to the 16th & Mission BART station so transportation to/from there was super easy.  Shopping thrift stores fantastic food and a more diverse community then I have ever experienced make up the Mission.  This location has all the grit and vibrant culture I imagined.  Mark and Rafael went out of their way to make me comfortable and gave some great sightseeing advise.  I can not recommend them enough.  There can't be a better choice in this area if you are looking for the whole experience of San Francisco and the Mission area.  I hope to make it back soon and I will be staying with them if possible. 
19949380,554144923,2019-10-25,4143335,Aner,Don’s place was large and beautifully decorated. Don was gracious and very responsive. Loved the location with great restaurants a short walk away.
17254515,260708236,2018-05-04,67223672,Jeff,Sabine is a wonderful host. Her place is amazing. So quite and close to everything. Loved it!
9118962,91479718,2016-08-05,79360540,Sachin,Nothing can go wrong @ Brian's place.  Everything was as described. Received instructions in advance nice and clean place.  would definitely stay there again. 
258873,480911790,2019-07-03,25379975,Mark,Debbie was a great host and Greg as the property owner was so kind and generous and accommodating. Great location you’re literally right down the hill from Coit Tower. We can’t wait to come back again when we’re back in SF. Thank you!!
24777563,416601448,2019-02-24,21073237,Érica,Jenny's place is exactly as shown in the pictures. And it's true that's not sound proof (which is not a big deal to me but could be to light sleepers). It is in a very residential area so there really aren't many good restaurants and coffee shops around which was a bit of a disappointment to me. But after having figured that out I just left really early in the morning and only came back at the end of the day. It's far from the city center and main attractions in San Francisco so be prepared for a one hour commute to such places. On the plus side the neighborhood is clean and feels safe - a different vibe from downtown. Also I realized that Jenny lives on the first floor and rents 3 rooms upstairs. The entrance is separate which gives more privacy to guests and less contact with hosts. Found this interesting as I usually stayed in places which just rented 1 room in the house and had more interaction between guests and host. Jenny was always available through text though was friendly and helpful.
9449061,105803511,2016-10-02,44116281,Jessica,Su Li was beyond accommodating to our family.  Traveling with two small children is always difficult but Su Li made is manageable and easy.  She allowed us an early check-in and delayed check-out.  We were so grateful for her flexibility.  Additionally the apartment is lovely.  It's all remodeled and very updated.  Everything was in excellent working condition and the location is absolutely fantastic.  Thanks so much! We LOVED every minute!
21847778,433559312,2019-04-06,250779465,Manuel,Place was clean and better than i expected. Had lots of tips and advice on both places to avoid and places to go to. Overall a great experience!

1421774,10394925,2014-02-17,11673911,Ian,If you're looking for the perfect cute little getaway STOP RIGHT NOW you've found it. I was completely blown away by everything the studio had to offer and how Airbnb Vanick & Deb went above and beyond our expectations to make us comfortable.
14934208,240908737,2018-03-06,86780219,Charlie,"In such a quite heart zone of SF Collin's place is convenient if you have rent a car with you during your journey.

Room is decorated with Harry Potter theme which would be very interesting if you are a fan. And he has WiiU there if you still have extra time for your journey :)

One extra tip: be sure that you have checked the time of the park near the building they do not open before 10AM on Sundays."
8684508,100223370,2016-09-08,11991359,Paula,Nice room in an excellent location!
4888308,95794540,2016-08-21,35654872,Alexis,nice communication no surprises photos were accurate the bedroom is very nice
26950540,520038902,2019-08-29,63487169,Kyrre,"A cosy place in the mission area of San Francisco. The room and other areas was clean and well maintained. Xiomara was a good host and responded quickly to our requests. 

There is another guy renting a room side by side the room we rented. He was friendly and quiet keeping mostly to himself. 

Mission itself is a little outside of the main tourist area so keep that in mind. Buses and Uber are readily available however so it wasn’t a problem for us.

All in all this was a nice stay for us. Can recommend to others."
7196412,50664207,2015-10-13,44197513,Kristine,"The appartement provides everything you need and it is well located. The Muni station and a bus stop are close by.
Clara answered all our questions directly and friendly so we felt welcomed and comfortable."
6074750,512778361,2019-08-18,130376316,Julie,Emplacement idéal dans SF. Propreté irréprochable et Jamie est vraiment sympa ! Le seul hic de notre séjour : le bruit. La chambre est mal isolée et nous avons eu beaucoup de mal à dormir car du bruit toute la nuit dans les bars et dans les appartements de la résidence prévoyez vos bouchons :) !
3591813,217542123,2017-12-09,14721209,Ainslie,We were in town for work and found Nicole's place to be a great home away from home to come back to at the end of long days. The home is very spacious we felt indulgent having so much room for two of us! The living room is very inviting with tons of books and games to dive into. Kitchen was well stocked with dishes and the bedrooms were comfortable and roomy. We also got sweet greetings from the 3 kitties downstairs when we left early each morning a lovely little extra.
32487296,440317805,2019-04-20,248618576,Jose,Great place to stay parking next to the stairs super useful.... hard to find parking in the street
2172308,21915045,2014-10-26,4016473,Holly & Rohan,We stayed here for two nights w a group of 5 adults 2 couples and a single friend. The house is darling clean and comfortable with a perfect central location. The back porch space was excellent for dining as a group and relaxing. Their home manual was excellent with great neighborhood recommendations and detailed instructions for everything in the house. They were kind enough to accommodate us leaving our bags for the day while we spent the day sightseeing and waiting for our late night flight. We would certainly stay here again or recommend this home to friends. 
4624467,368710980,2019-01-07,36798201,Brian,Outstanding stay in the Mission for 4 nights!  We had cold rainy weather and the fireplaces were so nice to have.  Easy walk to many wonderful places (Bi-rite salted caramel ice cream!! and Gracias Madre were both my favorites).  2 blocks to the BART station from SFO.  Would love to have used the outside seating but it was just too wet.  Definitely a place that I would stay again next time I am in San Fran.  The host was out of town when I was there but would love to have her cook for us one night next time we are there (she is a chef).  Very good value overall!
845501,191783749,2017-09-08,63286990,성민,Room is fine but you should bring everything you need. Delores is so kind she is gonna do the best to help you.
23121061,479393350,2019-06-30,264174043,Mary Claire,This space is wonderful! Very very clean modern and it feels like you're at home! The neighborhood is great with tons of great restaurants and stores right by you. There's a metro stop 5 minutes away and you can get anywhere in the city very quickly! Keith is very helpful and friendly and is around to answer questions and chat! 5 stars will absolutely stay here again in the future <3

1251570,5573266,2013-07-06,2628360,Kayvan,Kobi has a very nice place.  It was well kept and everything was in working condition.  The bathroom and kitchen were a bit dirty but that was somewhat expected when he gave us a discount for not having time to get a maid come by. Nice location and area.
4957143,28141656,2015-03-18,20978594,Taylor,Beth was a wonderful host; very friendly and accommodating. She was very easy to get ahold of through phone/email. She has recently redecorated the flat and it looks just as it does in the photos. Apartment has every necessary amenity the area is beautiful - very close to Alamo Square and great restaurants on Divisadero. I will definitely return.

12175415,332172930,2018-10-04,51144446,Rose,This place was in an amazing neighborhood in SF. Lots of great food and central location to the city. Clean and relatively quiet neighborhood. I usually travel with my dogs so it was quite nice to have a yard they could go out to without me worrying about cars and other dogs. The space was cute and had lots of thoughtful knick knacks and snacks. I would definitely stay in this place again!
5904305,263344896,2018-05-11,66093611,Kyle,Simple explanation on how to enter the building very friendly communication and an oasis in the city. Entering Sebastian’s place after a long day in SF was great. Felt like home!

34723923,497771353,2019-07-28,6947576,Jason,Loved my stay at this Airbnb! Everything was just as pictured and the place was extremely clean.

25662,50278190,2015-10-11,39012581,Deana,This is a great place to stay!  The room is spacious and there's a full kitchen and nice outdoor area.

4663060,543901053,2019-10-08,259042901,Kazi,Mark was a great host! The apartment was very cute and modern the bedroom was spacious. It was my first time in SF and this block is very steep! Noe Valley is a little out there for our activities as we were downtown most of the time but it had a great value for the price. The bathroom is kinda small but it was clean and well lit. Mark also provided many toiletries which was much appreciated.
21220773,235441799,2018-02-16,31659474,Barbara,This place is fabulous for anyone who loves a unique stay. The Old Firehouse has multiple sinks and shower huge living area and fantastic view. Location was perfect away from city noise but close enough for my event at the Fillmore. Loved safe off street parking. Caro and her family made me feel like a family friend. The house is open and welcome. Thanks for a great trip!
21880287,257080652,2018-04-24,31451384,Laurence,J'ai rarement eu un  accueil aussi chaleureux et parfait.

The neighborhood was perfect we were at walking distance from two beautiful parks with city views one of the city's most well rated restaurant (Delfina Pizzeria) and ice cream venue (Smitten) and had a supermarket and Starbucks conveniently across the street. We will likely be staying here again when we return to San Francisco highly recommend it."
269463,238484440,2018-02-25,6744494,Catherine,This is a very large apartment by San Francisco standards. I enjoyed my stay lots of interesting art and decor very nice CD collection. Great location.

The owner was responsive and helpful the unit was sparkling clean and had several small additions that I hadn’t seen in an Airbnb before. Will for sure come back here.
2315086,241338082,2018-03-08,5082972,Katie,Excellent value. We stayed for a week with our 2 year old. Our flight arrived several hours late and Ron was accommodating of that. The parking space/his garage right in front of his house is awesome (SF is plagued with poor parking). So close to Trader Joes Target and restaurants. His dog is very sweet and gentle. The bedrooms are on the back of the house so it's quiet at night. The beds are comfortable. The sleeper sofa in the 2nd room is big all 3 of us fit in it. The rooms are not baby-proofed but we could easily move fragile items and brought our own outlet covers. The kitchen was easy to use. We felt at home and would definitely come back!
11163298,193690046,2017-09-14,112739543,Sascha,The place was wonderful and we enjoyed our stay there very much. It was all clean and Valerie even got us some food and water to drink. Perfect. We would definitely stay there again.

It was such a tremendous living experience here. The house is well decorated and well equipped for travelers. Super clean and great lighted all day. The outdoor deck and garden and of course the fantastic downtown view always made us feel fresh and relaxing. Sleeping was quiet and cozy.

Safeway is only there blocks away. We used Uber to commute and it was quite convenient. 

Strongly recommended to Airbnb travelers :)"

21282133,228447162,2018-01-19,69391542,Cassandra,Lorenzo and Brian were such great host. Lorenzo let’s us know about the area and especially about which are great area’s to park if you are coming with a car which is hard to find in San Francisco (but we found it pretty easy near their home). Brian hosted us during our stay and he was a lovely host. He helped us get settled in gave us all the information we needed and made us feel at home. The home was beautiful clean and spacious. The area was safe and close to the city by car. We had a great stay!

4359078,542725098,2019-10-06,262774137,Rebecca,Super helpful and friendly staff. The office provided free coffee and fresh pastries every morning which was appreciated. Great location within reasonable walking distance to nice restaurants and Fisherman's Wharf (all down hill). The decor is a bit outdated but the beds were comfortable. Given the location and price I found Young's place to be a really good value. One tip- if you are traveling without small children you may want to request an upstairs room.
1005642,98208984,2016-08-29,65953938,Coralie,"Jan's place is ideally located in Mission just next to the Dolores Park.

992913,24710200,2015-01-02,19420404,Veronica,Abbiamo soggiornato da Irina per tre giorni a cavallo del Capodanno. La casa si trova in una posizione strategica vicinissima a molte attrazioni della città locali e ristoranti. Non ho conosciuto Irina di persona siamo stati accolti dal suo coinquilino Greg che si é dimostrato gentile e disponibilissimo! La camera ed il bagno non sono esattamente come appaiono nelle foto mi aspettavo qualcosa di meglio! 
21161595,407638018,2019-02-02,108453608,Christoph,We had a good time in Claudia's apartment. Claudia is very nice and has always responded directly she also likes to give recommendations if needed. She is a great host we felt very welcome she even made a present for my girlfriend who had birthday. Awesome! The apartment is very comfortable and lovingly furnished and was very clean. For 2 people very recommendable also because of the good location. It is only a few minutes to the Bart Station here you can go to downtown or go to Oakland without any problems both take less than 20 minutes. With the car it is a little bit more difficult to find a parking place but you can find it easily in the nearby main street. Absolutely recommendable!!!

8195090,266938455,2018-05-20,136434684,Mohamed,I really enjoyed this stay. Abby is such a great host. All details are well taken off. This place is better than what it looks like in the photos. The studio was very clean and tidy. Everything you need is available.
29062428,457268112,2019-05-23,29826207,Howard,Nathan is very friendly and responsive. The place is spacious and clean and very easy to find.
12110830,312089584,2018-08-22,143060601,Drew,Great place in a good location! Parking is hard specifically on Monday and Wednesday but not impossible. Close to everything clean and Zoila is very attentive. 
23354077,341398677,2018-10-26,59291015,Michael,Thomas’s place is exactly like the photos! The location is perfect as well around the corner to Mission Delores Park and the Castro. The guest handbook had a great selection of restaurant selections. Would definitely stay here again!
5749839,521278961,2019-08-31,18879235,Soizic,The cottage is really nice comfy and clean and has a really peaceful backyard we had a perfect stay there! Thanks Kysi!
10812630,77207092,2016-05-30,1222570,Kimberly & Orlando,We spent four wonderful days at Cindy's house and we were very pleased with the stay. Cindy is a fabulous host - her communications were clear and she was quick to respond to questions. She provided us with great tips for nearby markets restaurants and transportation. She even brought us fruit for our stay! As described the house is sunny comfortable and well appointed. The garage was a big plus since parking on the street can be limited. The location was ideal for us - close enough to the main tourist sites but out of the hustle and bustle allowing for quiet time (and good sleep). The neighborhood is quiet and there are a lot of little gems in walking distance. We even found the BEST Korean restaurant - our favorite - just around the corner. :) Thank you Cindy! See you next time.
14553693,408811422,2019-02-05,88104,Jacob,Rosa and Syd's studio is a gem. It's immaculate beautifully furnished well-designed quiet and private. The location just off the lively Divisidero corridor is great. I was visiting for business and didn't need a full kitchen and it was a perfect place to call home for several days. I'll definitely be back!
28440838,536948550,2019-09-27,37270878,Alison,Absolutely gorgeous place with super stylish furnishings and an amazing view. Thank you Theresa!

106025,2593267,2012-10-13,1743659,Rob,"This is a beautiful place to stay in SFO. We stayed for 1 week.
Very good location near Union Square. You can do everything from there by foot or public transport!

The apartment is really nice. Very clean enough space for us 2. Great kitchen with everything you might need!

I highly recommend this apartment!

Thanks Annette!"
2783251,259297802,2018-05-01,39813013,Kathrin,Die Lage ist absolute Spitze. Ellen hat vorab eine genaue Anleitung geschickt so konnten wir die Adresse schnell finden und einchecken. Das Appartment ist sehr stilvoll und zugleich gemütlich und trotz Toplage absolut ruhig gelegen. Das Bett und auch die ausgezogene Wohnzimmercouch waren sehr bequem. Die Ausstattung ist klasse. Alles ist sehr sauber. Zudem gibt es als Zusatz noch den Blick auf die Bay von einer bezaubernden Terasse aus. Ellen hat auf unsere Fragen zuverlässig und schnell reagiert. Eine wirklich zu empfehlende Unterkunft für eine schöne Zeit in San Francisco. Wir haben uns wie zuhause gefühlt.
21281846,231978806,2018-02-03,33288403,Eric,Kim's place is very clean.  There is a shared bathroom but it was immaculate.  The price point was good and the location was quite good for anyone who has business in the Sunset District of San Francisco.  On-street parking is convenient especially on weekends.  There is a family living upstairs and the wifi can be spotty.
17237462,407609189,2019-02-02,101456534,민호,It was really good
6107359,536981320,2019-09-27,47319930,Amanda,I only stayed here overnight for a quick trip but it was perfect! Clean cozy and comfortable and very thoughtfully arranged. I appreciated that there was coffee a bottle of wine and a basket of fruit - especially since I arrived very late at night and had no time to go to the store and buy anything for my stay. I was able to have coffee and fruit in the morning for breakfast which I found to be thoughtful and especially needed for me on this trip. No complaints!
31143926,479395136,2019-06-30,52318404,Victor,"I would definitely come back. Spencer and Melissa are awesome hosts! Very accommodating. 
The room itself is all it is said to be. 
My friend and I had an awesome time."
18928482,267790119,2018-05-22,131705428,Shoshanna,Our stay with Felicity was fantastic! Felicity was very welcoming and put a great deal of effort into making us feel comfortable. The room we stayed in was excellent and very clean. The location was great too being very close to a public transit line the beach and many restaurants. I would highly recommend staying here! 
16872797,291953940,2018-07-16,85214370,Yi,Marie gave us very warm welcome and delicious breakfast. We would stay here again if we come to SF.
20765941,446566812,2019-05-01,168034465,Johanna,it was an affordable place to stay... it may be a bit far from the Union Square but there's a convenient transportation called the MUNI very near the airbnb that you can ride.
3124541,63011024,2016-02-19,777956,Zehra,"Yuca is a wonderful host and has a lovely house. When I read that shoe was not allowed inside the house I thought this is a clean house. It was spotless. Our room and private bathroom was hard to beat compare to hotels in San Fransisco and I have stayed in five star during my previous visit.
The neighborhood is lovely. Walking from home to metro which takes 15 minutes is a joy. I loved the long stairs makes you feel like a tourist in a exotics place.
Yuca's recommendations for good food was right on money.
Thank you for opening your house to Airbnb Yuca."
13022232,171133435,2017-07-16,129352239,Liqing,Peihong's house is very clean. I like the washroom with roof window. It is very convenient to take bus to downtown. Also Peihong is very nice and helpful.
2302408,90597261,2016-08-01,72702488,Debbie Leavitt,This mother in law suite is quite large and accommodating.  It is located only blocks away from Golden Gate Park.  It was a very quiet and private location to stay.
1699390,516719943,2019-08-24,243678034,Alva,Amazing!
8974563,418244824,2019-03-01,10409300,Braden,"Craig was a fantastic host. Very communicative quick responder and very accommodating. He let me drop my luggage off before check-in and when he found out I liked coffee - made sure that a pot was made and ready for me every morning - which is far more than I could have asked for.

The Victorian may be old but it's very well kept with recently renovated bathrooms a nice kitchen and tidy bedrooms. Shared bath but with only 1 other guest - and while there are a number of guests in the house - everyone was very respectful and quiet during my stay.

Room has a bed desk and window seat - which is really all I needed. The large windows let in tons of natural light when wanted and the window curtains block it out when not wanted."
5144482,133466898,2017-02-22,78735786,Vanezza,"Location was perfect convenient and beautiful. And PARKING on the premises. Lots of other hosts tell you there's a parking spot but it's on the street or ""always spots available"" but this location HAS parking in the driveway. The house was prefect. Beautiful clean spacious. Michelle is such a wonderful host. She also left an awesome care package upon our arrival and she was always a text or phone call away. Very sweet. Would definitely stay here again!"
10706423,130962649,2017-02-09,4002862,Joe,"Lily has a timeshare at the Worldmark which is essentially a hotel.  I suspect that you get a different room each time but it's always a studio with the same basic amenities: a small microwave and fridge and a bed and desk.  It's pretty comparable to a moderately priced hotel (think ""La Quinta"").  The staff are very friendly.  They were short on cleaning people the day that I checked in so I couldn't get into the room until after 4.   But the location was great (near Union Square) and it was a comfortable place."
4121114,27002092,2015-02-23,23369147,Maria Chaveli,Valerie's house was exactly what we expected and even more. It is nestled in a friendly neighborhood that made us feel like real locals. The rooms were clean the beddings were comfortable and it was exactly what we needed after a long day of touring the city. The house is open with a refreshing view of the neighborhood in the mornings. We felt safe and sound here.  Thank you for the amazing hospitality! We'll be back for more visits!
4429475,74783627,2016-05-16,63518291,Joan,Mike was great at keeping in touch and being available. All that helped to make us feel at ease and comfortable in his lovely home. We had all that was promised and all we needed to have the comforts of home away from home. We were also left with a welcome note and bottle of wine.. A very nice touch. 
20217846,239682111,2018-03-02,24501030,Steve,Great place very convenient and overall excellent stay.
17041687,163456667,2017-06-24,32454409,Nathalia,"O quarto e banheiros são limpos. O quarto é exatamente como está na foto. Os banheiros são compartilhados mas não pegamos ""fila"" em nenhum momento.
A recepção do hotel é super simpática e disposta a ajudar e passar informações.
Para quem quer ficar no centro é uma ótima localização (perto dos transportes publicos lojas e movimentado) mas não é ideal para quem quer ficar perto de barzinhos e restaurantes mais descolados... 
Importante saber que Herbert não é uma pessoa e sim uma mistura de hotel com hostel (tem uma sala de convivência microondas máquina de lavar tv e etc..). 
O Wi-Fi funcionou super bem.
Vale o custo benefício."
14538591,307127105,2018-08-13,17848536,Kamilah,Pauline's place was a perfect spot for our weekend in the city. Her home is amazingly close to Golden Gate Park in a nice quiet neighborhood and her space is a great studio that felt like home. Although we never met her she was quick to assist with check-in and make sure we were situated. My husband and I would definitely return for our next stay in the city.
6437010,83962965,2016-07-04,73217119,Tanya,very comfortable/cozy spot in a convenient part of the city! We ended up walking to most places! Having a living room to chill in during the day that turns into a bedroom when you need it was nice too.
18615032,246092234,2018-03-24,43693949,Lola,"It’s a small bachelor unit underneath a home while I was staying it rained all week and since it’s a underground unit it might be a bit chilly. But the electric fireplace was really rad!

The unit is very roomy and enough for two people to use comfortably! It was quiet enough me to sleep during the nights and relatively easy to get around town! 

For quick snacks or beverages you might want to pick up there’s a small liquor store at the end of the block - I picked me up some Advil one night."
34756884,557307642,2019-10-31,17122201,Susan,Derek was an excellent host with great communication. He responded immediately any time I had a question.  The place was brand new immaculate and very stylish.  Check-in was super easy (the easiest I've experienced so far!).  We loved the location -- walking distance to parks shopping food and transportation.
12725886,255181671,2018-04-19,94571569,Celene,Amazing location super close to food transit and some fun little shops! Debbie was amazingly thorough and her place was immaculate!! It really felt nice to come home to at the end of a busy day. Plus to wake up to such a beautiful balcony drenched in sunlight breathtaking! To also add that bed was so comfortable as others have mentioned I practically wanted to pack it with me when I left! Debbie was really quick with responses gave us amazing restaurant suggestions and was the perfect host! Little Yoda was as well! Thanks for your hospitality!!
15330348,189702046,2017-09-02,94646708,Lisa,Nice large room with large bathroom perfect size for 2 people. Very quiet and safe neighborhood.
8275596,400356763,2019-01-11,24971085,Karin,It was a great time staying at Rebecca’s. I felt like home when I stayed there. Both Rebecca and her dog Lola made the stay was fantastic. Thank you
23821738,457696415,2019-05-24,15239291,Lynne,The Presidential Suite is very luxurious in its decor and amenities. Full kitchen dining room and living room for entertaining. Though it’s set up like a hotel normal services like routine housekeeping and room service are not provided. Expect a little push by the Wyndham sales folks but they are not too persistent. Overall though you will feel pampered in the room with all of its space and beautiful furnishings.
5299538,47730706,2015-09-21,41668481,Bryce,One of the best experiences I have ever had. Great host and great community. Definitely would stay there again!

Room and facilities were exactly what was described and Rong even prepared breakfast for us!

18916029,366561569,2019-01-02,26265089,Ricardo,This place was over just better then I could of asked for . Ton of great art in the apartment and close to pretty much everything. They new that my partner and I came in for the New Years and had a bottle of wine waiting for us would definitely stay here again
351978,22355574,2014-11-04,17912968,Allen,Maria has been an excellent host and maintains a very nice property. My stay in San Francisco has been lovely. Maria is extremely quick with email and was very flexible when I needed to extend my stay. Next time I am in SF this will be the first place I look for accommodations. You will not find better service or a better deal!

8763407,159364134,2017-06-10,72690827,Melissa,"Location was great and room/beds were comfortable but the best part of the stay were the hosts and others guests-- friendly but respectful accommodating but not invasive...list goes on. 

Zain and Duncan were some seriously fascinating awesome peeps. STAY HERE. Totally makes the trip."
134015,77823007,2016-06-03,7848784,Rosie,Fantastic location and wonderfully equipped apartment.  Heidi was so lovely and accommodating to us and our baby. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would wholly recommend Heidi's home.
35655138,541749686,2019-10-05,80186773,Patric,"The listing is fairly accurate but there are some things you should know.

1. There are many people in the house - about 15-20 people at a time.
2. The location isn't that safe. There are many homeless people roaming the area and at one point during my stay roofer came into the building and a homeless woman broke into the house. She stole a bunch of our packages and wandered throughout the house. Because there were ~20 people in the house though many of resident weren't sure whether she actually belonged or not until she was questioned.
3. Cleaners don't come as much as necessary. Trash is taken out twice a week by the cleaning service but as a result of how many people are in the house they really should be coming MWF."
5299461,368947579,2019-01-08,221546188,Ryan,Great place close to downtown great atmosphere and great hosts!
4695477,38523389,2015-07-16,15116665,Frances,Lovely bright studio with plenty of room for 2 people. Excellent guide left for us was much appreciated. Terrific neighborhood with nice quiet residential streets as well as funky Haight St good restaurants & so close to the Golden Gate Park where we had fun cycling. Uber pool takes you almost anywhere of interest in the city for about $10.
754117,6339404,2013-08-09,5121984,Isabelle,On s'est sentis chez soi dès la première minute ! Voire mieux que chez soi ! L'appartement est nickel et notamment au niveau du ménage. Intérieur cossu et meublé avec goût. Vaste clair et lumineux la réalité dépasse les photos. Excellente literie matelas et sur matelas d!'un confort exceptionnel  couette hyper douillette   peignoirs et serviettes de bain à profusion. Il ne manque rien dans la cuisine on a même trouvé assiettes et couverts à pique nique. Appartement super high tech : Tv dans la chambre Tv 3D dans le salon home cinema multitude de DVD un ordinateur ..... La culture n'est pas en reste : de nombreux livres sur san Francisco ..... À découvrir avec bonheur. Un jardin côté chambre très calme où l'on peut profiter d'un jacuzzi (hot tub!). Devant une jolie terrasse pour déjeuner par beau temps. Très bien situé dans san Francisco une rue au calme mais proche de la bouillonnante haight street. 2 supérettes proches et bien achalandées...... Des produits tendance et bio. 2 bus à 2 minutes à pied : le 6 et le 71 pour accéder en 15mn à downtown.Ryan a tout fait pour rendre notre séjour très confortable. Très disponible par mail et très chaleureux. Sur place nous avons apprécié ses conseils. Pour conclure aucun reproche à faire la location à largement dépassé nos espérances. Cela a largement participé aux bons souvenirs que nous garderons de san francisco. Merci encore à Ryan et trycia. Famille Sacco 
728585,103656070,2016-09-23,12815912,Jeff,"Doug was the perfect host. From helping us with the check in procedures to providing recommendations on where to eat and get coffee. The cottage couldn't have been better. The space is clean and welcoming and included all essential amenities. 

Doug was very quick with responding to any and all questions we may have had and helped make our visit to San Francisco a huge success. 

Couldn't recommend this place enough!"
18107901,479347182,2019-06-30,186212735,Jacob,Me and my girlfriend had an amazing stay at Jeff’s place. Very clean good location and friendly host.
10545518,176812766,2017-07-31,46925979,Xiaolin,Karen's house is new and beautifully decorated. It is located in a residential area very quite yet convenient. She prepared some snacks for our stay. Although we did not meet in person she responded to my message very promptly and made my stay very pleasant. Thanks!
1618782,20170727,2014-09-24,5461463,Anna,"What can I say? The room was absolutely beautiful.  You can tell Tim & Young Mi put a lot of time and thought into giving their guests a great Airbnb experience.  The only difference between this room and a class hotel room was that this room provided full instructions to the facilities tips and guides for the neighbourhood maps books etc.

Tim & Young Mi were very welcoming and it is very obvious that they are world travellers and want to give their guests the experience that they would expect when they travel.  They were lovely as were there two dogs."
13687128,92438871,2016-08-08,17640952,Exequiel,I had a great time at Danny's place. As a host he was very cool and welcoming and his place was conveniently located and very comfortable. I would recommend Danny and his place to any of my friends and hope I get to visit San Francisco and stay at his place again soon. 
17650333,189132901,2017-08-31,17836040,Amy,Erin's place was great! Perfect for my work trip - clean quiet and comfortable. She was very easy to communicate with and very responsive.
25459025,474014630,2019-06-22,71260966,Oscar,Mimi was very friendly and helpful. My dad and I were having a great time staying. Transportation to/from downtown SF is very convenient. Definitely recommended for a short trip in SF.
4838843,564369388,2019-11-15,213931416,Leah,We had a wonderful 4 night stay at Carly and Allie's apartment. It's spacious with incredibly comfortable beds and right in the heart of the Marina District with shops and restaurants in every direction. The place is beautiful and homey. Carly and Allie have made sure to include all the necessities you could ever need with special touches throughout the place. We'd highly recommend spending your vacation here—we would certainly stay again!
36203342,541126859,2019-10-04,140482828,Gabrielle,Decent option for the price. Walls are super thin so be prepared to hear EVERYTHING. Robert is always available to help out so that's good.

34684071,568758458,2019-11-24,45048097,Afton,Super cute private Airbnb out of the craziness of town. Super easy street parking and nice neighborhood. Another plus was the extremely hot water in the shower and super comfy bed!
28722160,451417879,2019-05-11,239729504,Michal,It was a great stay at Zhi’s apartment . Host is very responsive and there is no problem with leaving luggage before/after check in/out.

5086367,110537738,2016-10-26,92018525,Abhilasha,Elena is a very good host who manages the arrival and stay of guests in a very well organized manner. She provides all the required information on the day of arrival and patiently answers all the questions. She does not live in the house and visits occasionally. The house is clean secure and has all the amenities mentioned in the listing. The room itself is clean and safe and there's a private door that can be used to go out and come-in without the need to access other parts of the house. Elena divides the storage area in common/shared spaces such as fridge kitchen cabinets among the housemates so that each one has a designated area to keep their personal stuff. In addition to this room there are two other rooms in the house. The room mate who has been living in another room for a relatively long time is a very pleasant female and was very helpful to me during my stay there. The location is a very central one neighborhood is very safe and MUNI bus stops are very close to the apartment that provide good connectivity across SF. Overall I had a great stay at Elena's place.
3549398,125596093,2017-01-06,100801992,Flo,"I can clearly recommend this place. Michael is such a kind person and helps you with every thing you need. :) You also can not complain about the view from the living room and the walks to the high situated house always keep you fit. 
I really loved it to stay there and I would love to do so again.
Michael is a Superhost and now I know why. Thank you for all :)"

The loft is beautiful and I really love the decor. Would definitely stay here again. "
30091565,547289762,2019-10-14,31763909,Marian,Location was great. We liked walking around the neighborhood. Lots of coffee shops and restaurants. We didn’t get to experience the area a lot because  we were busy with our daughter but it was all good.
2202505,472018011,2019-06-18,161205062,Michael,Lots of space in a great location. Good communication and an easy check-in/check-out process. The owners live there when not renting so that comes with pros and cons - it feels very homey but their belongings pretty much filled every space. It feels more like visiting friends than having your own clean space to spread out on vacation. The neighborhood is great with tons of shops and restaurants. Overall we enjoyed our stay but felt it was a little pricey for the experience.
8904047,178552779,2017-08-05,10710227,Diana,"What a sweet stay we had at Amy's! A true ""pied a terre"" with fun art cozy bedroom comfy living area. The neighborhood is quiet and close to both the Mission and Castro areas so lots of great food.  Also close to Dolores Park and the original mission of St Francis! Very accurate  as described. "
11947349,567901319,2019-11-23,80471188,Sarah,"This apartment is the most charming and convenient spot that is perfect for anyone looking for a home away from home while visiting San Francisco. The bed was very comfortable (a little on the firm side) and the room is spacious. It was great to have a private bathroom adjoining the room. Just like a hotel but so much more personal. I like the little design touches especially the courtyard decorations. The apartment is SO close to the Castro MUNIS subway stop - two blocks tops (one is uphill but that's par for the course in SF). I loved being right in the heart of the Castro and strolling down Castro St. for the shops. Hot Cookie makes very tasty baked goods!

Laurence is a gracious and kind host. I loved chatting with him about our shared values and the history and culture of the Castro. I didn't get the chance to meet Nick but his communications via Airbnb and email was polite informative and very responsive.

I would highly recommend staying with Laurence and Nick if you can!"

The space is well designed and easy to relax or study in. This is a perfect transitional place if you are making a move or if you are simply looking for a quiet and comfortable place to stay.
345760,33130804,2015-05-25,15375723,Calvin,My sister and I enjoyed the comfort of Ashish's lovely home during our visit to SF on Memorial Day weekend.  We were able to enjoy walking around the neighborhood at night after a full day of being tourists in the city.  Nice job Ashish!
21632344,352776971,2018-11-25,225325461,Araceli,The room was great. I liked that there was a washer and dryer available because it rained during our stay. Great experience overall.
10251,16304578,2014-07-25,4106015,Alison,The place was beautiful and clean. We really enjoyed staying here.  I never met the owner however we communicated with her via email and she was quick to respond.  The only issue we had was the parking however she allowed us to use her spot after we let her know we were having an issue.  We appreciates that. Thanks 
8287266,129411288,2017-01-30,39956293,Tan,Alex & Daniel’s place was great super clean super central. It is also very quite perfect if you want to have a good night sleep. I definitely recommend.

Bob was a delight had coffee ready for us in the morning and was very accommodating and approachable.  Bed was very comfortable area quiet safe and with easy parking.

Highly recommend."

21597747,318466623,2018-09-03,11554867,Ashley,I stayed at Lauren's place while looking for an apartment in SF after relocating from NYC. The apartment is clean with many amenities and is quite centrally located. The check-in/out was easy and Lauren was always available if I had any questions.

Mike always responded quickly as well. Loved the neighborhood as well-we had our two young kids with us and went to the children's playground in Golden Gate park many times with ease. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to family and friends. 
28588615,443305467,2019-04-25,178308206,Scott,Nando's place in an excellent location and he is an excellent host. His place is clean well appointed and spacious. And you can't beat the location.

8275596,97032421,2016-08-25,90895894,Dana,As my first Airbnb experience they really set the bar high for my future bookings. I can't complain about a thing I'm not really one to travel alone but I felt like I was home and they were so welcoming. The house is was beautiful and the room I stayed in was perfect and super comfy. They stocked me up with water and even a little chocolate. Oh and their pup is adorable and I enjoyed spending some time with her on the porch. :)
24749696,322322593,2018-09-12,9901847,Elisa,Really good and fast communication. Apartment was tidy and clean with amenities provided. Andrew also provided breakfast which was handy.

256148,2460999,2012-10-01,1543691,Michael,"Best place to stay in SF. Chris was wonderful and so were the cats.
The room was very nice and it was marvelous to have a separate bathroom and an own direct access to the  little garden behind the house. We especially appreciated that we could use all facilities like the washer and dryer for example.
Chris was extremely helpful and her advice about the city and the different places to go for food for example were priceless. It was always a pleasure to talk to her and she always gave us the feeling to stay with friends. We had a terrific time and plan to come back soon."

442397,334295296,2018-10-08,127775263,Rae,We (6 adults) stayed at Marianne’s for 4 nights in October. The space is exactly as described even better. Marianne met us at check in and provided a thorough orientation. The home has EVERYTHING you need. Beds are comfortable bathrooms are high-end lots of extra thoughtful touches that made us feel like we were staying with our favourite Aunt!! And the location... if you prefer the beach to Union Square this is perfect. We are already planning another trip to San Francisco and Marianne’s!
13943674,91685163,2016-08-06,63088664,Surjyakanta,The place is small but sufficient for a single person stay. It was very clean with all things neatly arranged. Daryush had kept the bathroom and toiletries neatly arranged and organised. He kept notes at different places in the house to help me in a comfortable stay. Daryush was very responsive. He took extra care in providing me with as much information as possible after my booking till check-in and during stay as well. I would stay here again.
70753,45402083,2015-09-02,26671786,Sherry,good location but too crowded and no private space at all :(((
13157125,297986257,2018-07-28,141574421,Sabrina,"David is a 5-star host! His home is located in a very safe location of San Francisco. From the moment I arrived in SF at 10:30pm David made sure I was safe and welcomed me at the door. I didn’t have to go digging for keys at a late hour in an area I was unfamiliar with. This makes all the difference for solo travelers such as myself. The bedroom and bathroom he provides is immaculate and super trendy. If transportation is a concern thank God for Uber. It’s only $7 up north! Good deal. Otherwise you can take a nearby bus but who does that? I would definitely stay in David’s Home again if ever in the area and highly recommend to all. Hotels in the area will cost you double and just not worth it. You will feel safer at David’s and become acquainted with non-touristy parts of SF. Just do it...(I just did that.) David thanks again! 
Cheers

40092,517270,2011-09-10,600186,Samuel,Brians apartment was in a perfect location- the Mission district was our favourite part of San Francisco and in walking distance from everywhere that was cool and not too touristy. He was respondent and hospitable and I would definitely recommend staying here- and would stay here again if I come back in the future. 
60365,3023264,2012-12-04,3378622,Gui,This is a beautiful house with plenty of room for 6 adults.  Neighborhood is charming with lots of walk-able restaurants and easy access to mass transit systems.  This house was a pleasure to call home during our San Francisco trip and would recommend Emilie's house to anyone.

Kenix und ihr Mann sind zu jeder Zeit erreichbar. Wegbeschreibung etc sind gegeben. Das einzige was etwas schade war dass die Unterkunft etwas abseits lag. Mit Uber oder ein bisschen Bewegung ist es jedoch möglich ins Zentrum zu gelangen. "
2223743,50482643,2015-10-12,3143253,Barbara,Perfect place to stay because you have your own entrance and it's on a dead-end street so very quiet. I did not have a car so don't know about the parking situation. The kitchen was fully equipped. Huge TV shown but no cable. You need to have an Apple account and computer on hand to use it. Bed very comfortable

25786409,510187916,2019-08-15,9671536,Leni,This house has a pleasant vibe and lots of good spaces.  The main bedroom and dining area look out onto a great yard with giant trees.  It is close to a huge amount of good places and public transportation as well as parking are easy.  The hosts are helpful and kind.  You'll like it here.
6911587,491082969,2019-07-19,6413133,Tim,Todd's place is in a great location very quick to downtown on the Bart. Todds communication was great he and his family were very welcoming and respectful. The bedroom is very large and kitchen well equipped to make meals. Worked great for my 3 day busines trip.
1344752,30308345,2015-04-20,29169390,Daniele,Patti made us feel very welcome. On arrival there was a cute binder including nearby activities and restaurant recommendations. House was very cute clean and with lots of character. Only downside was that the dining area was somewhat small but kitchen was charming and decor was beautiful. We had an amazing stay nice central location. I would definitely stay again!
18960282,338178784,2018-10-18,2079633,Fayna,Sarah’s place was exactly as described and super convenient. The room is clean and cozy and the communication with Sarah was great. She made both check in and check out super easy despite of our special time requests due to flight. She also recommended the best restaurants that were absolutely great!
11713614,204557277,2017-10-18,3335086,Marie-Claire,Stylish and comfortable this is a true home from home (well it's better than my home!)  The streets are of course steep so be prepared to Lyft or Uber everywhere which we did ($12 to the city).  Views from the back deck make morning coffee a treat.  Having laundry to hand for a long stay was just wonderful and the fully stocked kitchen was great too.  As Ann is a chiropractor she's taken great care with the comfort of her guests  - that bed gave me the best nights sleep I've had in a long time.
32702921,447459593,2019-05-03,32453762,Chu,Very clean never ran into host so felt very private. Perfect for two people or even more with extra bedding provided. Great communication and even reminded us about street cleaning and parking and provided recommendations. Would definitely recommend.

4890230,28262858,2015-03-21,7728522,Chris,Very friendly staff; these guys really know how to treat their guests well.  Great location awesome kitchen and dinning area. I also loved that they always had something going on everyday where people could get together and go out and see the town.

4175303,127871369,2017-01-21,29580279,Yao,It was a great experience staying at Stuart and Amanda's place. They are very helpful and communicative always ready to response to questions and requests. The place is located at a lovely neighborhood close to Hayes Street with a lot of shops. Although the room is a bit small but very cozy and nicely decorated. Part of the room charge was donated to local non-profit illustrating the spirit of sharing. Highly recommended. 
14029901,508409577,2019-08-12,158368,Davide,The room was perfect and both the hosts have been very nice and helpful they gave us tips on the neighborhood. The dog was also adorable

4026354,230687288,2018-01-28,87193012,Raymond,Candy's place was awesome. You use entire 1st floor of the house (w/ separate entrance) and Candy's family lives on the second floor; they can always come down and help you when you need something. She replies to txt messages and phone calls really fast too. The place was neat and clean and has everything you may need during the stay.
9752333,439317428,2019-04-18,23122164,Steve,We had a wonderful stay at Peg and Jeff's apartment and especially enjoyed coffee on the peaceful deck in the morning.  The full moon view through the skylights was astounding.   And the public transportation connections were exceptional.
9563163,171065916,2017-07-16,13618850,Brian,dani and darius and great- very friendly and accommodating. the place has that great sf feel and in a great location
845501,65970105,2016-03-18,47377851,Alicia,This for us perfect for our stay in sf. We stayed for three nights and every night was quite and private even though other people lived in the house. We had a car which was good for transportation. But once we took the bus and subway into city which was more easy than take the car. Everything was good. 
699723,21405429,2014-10-16,9274015,Christopher,Great apartment. Comfortable and cozy. Good location. Reid was a great host. 
17433075,401743768,2019-01-15,52200821,Jen,a very good bang for your buck situation! definitely a different kind of hostel - almost reminded me of being in a dorm in college. be wary as the room is right by the stairs and communal bathroom if you are a light sleeper! on the weekends we definitely heard people going up and down in their shoes - but not a major problem. was definitely a comfortable stay with a cute window view of the street for people watching!
9882716,77850720,2016-06-04,3165837,Daniel,"Donna lives upstairs and personally met me very flexibly at checkin.  She had fruit coffee and other treats available if I needed and pointed me to a great coffee shop around the corner.

The apartment is very spacious and comfortable with some outdoor space too."
1827177,60420794,2016-01-23,6080076,Judi,I have stayed twice at this property and have already booked my third visit. The property is beautiful tastefully decorated convenient and provides all the comforts of home. The hosts are more than helpful and accommodating. I highly recommend. 
314248,421547067,2019-03-09,50436913,Jennie,Gracious host; comfortable beautiful and spacious home with every amenity. Stellar location. Would have given 10 stars if 10 were a choice. Thank you Sarah for a lovely lovely stay.
109883,1239650,2012-05-07,2039910,Chet,"The rooms are in a separate part of the hosts' private residence at the bottom of 27 tiled steps which could be trecherous when wet. We had some difficulty finding the address as there is no legible number visible on the house (the number is painted on the curb in black lettering). The area is an upscale residential area. We never did find the wooded area mentioned on the website. On arrival Joan was upset because there had been a miscommunication between Adam and Joan about our arrival time and she was waiting to go somewhere.

The accommodations were comfortable and quiet. The in-wall space heaters worked well providing plenty of heat on a cold and windy day. This is a self-service B&B continental style with fresh ground coffee whole wheat english muffins orange juice plenty of yogurt butter for the muffins dry cereal and instant oatmeal packets. There was no milk for the cereal or oatmeal however and no shampoo so be sure to bring your own milk and shampoo. A Safeway and convenience store can be found about a mile west on Monteray Blvd.

32491838,510147862,2019-08-15,44132629,Serena,Just as pictured very large great view quiet beautiful modern bathroom.  The kitchen was huge as well and Norman stocked it with coffee and some milk.  He brought us fruit as well.   There is great hiking nearby and the walk down to west portal is very picturesque. I would recommend this home and would stay here again. Be prepared for hills.  Lyft came very quickly every time and the bus stop is adjacent to the home.
132441,468094703,2019-06-11,20720727,Coline,"The Kurt's home is a small treasure in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood. We felt directly home when we arrived Kurt wad here and explained how the house works gave some details about things to do and to see around (restaurants etc). The decoration is so cute and cosy as it is on the pictures. It is also perfectly clean. We could make some coffee in the morning and enjoy the very nice courtyard anytime. 
It is easy to reach the metro and other transports and with Uber it is just 20min away from the city center.
Sa Francisco is an expensive city and we couldn't have dreamt for a better price at this attractive rate besides the neighbourhood is very safe and quiet.
We will come back for sure !"

6006768,360223888,2018-12-19,123173805,Jacob,Mimi and Mosh are the most amazing hosts looking after a wonderful space! If you are looking for a quiet space that is clean and has TONS of thoughtful touches along with a fantastic location near everything this is the place!
4880988,34951517,2015-06-14,8835001,Jonathan,The listing was very accurate.  The location was fantastic--perfect access to the entire city.  The apartment was set up exactly as we had discussed--2 fold outs already set up.  The kitchen and living room were excellent places to relax.  We rented a car and the parking rules are such that one must move one's car each day by 10 AM but that was never a problem.

13022232,189065345,2017-08-31,35573083,Maike,Peihong's place is great. Check-in was smooth. Breakfast (coffee juice and cereal) was available every morning and everything was clean. Bathroom is a very good size. The bed is a little on the hard side. Peihong is very helpful definitely recommend! Street parking can be difficult especially if you arrive at night. She allowed us to park in front of her garage the last night which was super nice since we had a lot of bags etc. Made check - out very easy!
3720392,83521334,2016-07-03,75655310,Jaideep,"We had a great stay in San Francisco.
The apartment was well furnished clean and centrally located.
Kelly did a great job of providing us with all the information we needed since this was our first visit to the city and 1st Airbnb experience.
Would love to come back.
Only downside was the street parking with the 2 hour limit during the day. But you don't really need a car if just staying in the city as Uber was really convenient."
7989636,104802822,2016-09-28,7824479,Evan,Room was exactly as described and Lindy was extremely hospitable. Free parking was a huge plus! Thanks again for the great stay!

I ended up spending quite a few nights out of my stay hanging out with them and the other guests at treat. I'll definitely be staying here again on my next trip to SF.

He was an excellent host and went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay there again if and when we return to San Francisco.  I highly recommend staying there!
284117,107131129,2016-10-09,68304439,Heather,My husband and I spent six nights in Samantha's cottage. We were SO happy we stayed here! Samantha was a wonderful host. She was easy to get in touch with and made sure we had everything we needed. We immediately felt at home. The cottage is clean comfortable and private. Public transit is right around the corner and makes it simple to get to all parts of San Francisco. There is a convenient corner store where you can get groceries and basic necessities. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. There are a number of eateries in the area if you don't feel like going far. We highly recommend staying here!!
748256,38652224,2015-07-17,37732087,Kelly,Michael and Yesica made me feel extremely welcome in their space. Their apartment was actually much nicer and felt safer than the hotel I stayed in the previous night. I was using airbnb for the first time while out interviewing in San Francisco and nervous about needing to find a place to leave my bags before I checked in and after I checked out. When I asked Michael and Yesica responded within a couple minutes and I felt very safe leaving my bags in their place. Their apartment has an exterior locked door to get in the building and then another locked entrance into the apartment and also a lock on the bedroom door.  Its very modern with hardwood floors updated appliances and a spa like bathroom. They provided water and fresh towels with a delicious piece of chocolate in the room. The whole place gets lots of sunlight and is centrally located in the mission. The room its self was larger than I expected with a closet and a desk and a mirror on the wall which was great for getting ready. I met them both while I was there and they were very friendly and accommodating. Overall I would definitely recommend their place to a friend and would love to stay again.

I enjoyed talking with Paul; he has quite a green thumb. Beautiful flowers from his garden were in the bedroom to go with the beautiful view. He provided coffee and tea. I was downtown Financial district /Market street in 25 mins door to door by #37 bus accessed just around the corner from his place. Tom is partner took time to help show me the neighborhoods on a map. I even walked to Noe Valley 20 mins. Paul works from home up stairs 9-5.

Valentino is a great host with so many local tips to share. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and wished it was longer. The room is clean with a lovely private bathroom. I couldn’t have asked for more it was perfect San Fransisco.

17767863,552471256,2019-10-21,37383,Evan,The Red Vic is a very cool communal operation that's in the heart of Haight/Ashbury. There's a huge living/dining/chilling space on the ground floor and rooms of many types above. My room had its own bathroom was dead silent and the bed was very comfortable. It was a fun and cool place to stay right in the middle of it all.

2738331,73414418,2016-05-08,13340074,May,"Flip's apartment is very accurate to the photos - a low ceiling clean and lovely with a sweet private garden. It is in a popular area with a 60s vibe lots of tourist attractions restaurants etc. while the smoky 60s vibe of the area is nice and interesting it could be a bit unpleasant on the weekends and night times so be aware.
Flip was a very kind host made us feel very welcome and offered help when we needed. 
Thank you Flip! hope to see you again!"
8336042,215277695,2017-11-28,69272695,Pam,This was our second stay at Matthew & Anastasia’s place. The studio was just as we remembered it: spacious clean and comfortable. Our son and his wife are only a 10 minute walk away. 15 minute walk to the 24th St BART. There’s a great little cafe down the street. We highly recommend Matthew and Anastasia’s place for short or long stays in the Bay area.

8489712,315380087,2018-08-28,154203513,Vincent,The host Karthik is great and friendly.  Response time is good.  The unit is stylish and adequate.  Bathroom is clean and large enough with plenty of amenities and towers.  The only issue i encountered was this property doesn’t not allow FedEx delivery.  You will have to take the missed delivery notes and drive to one of the depot to pick up your parcel. The bed is a full size bed that may be a tiny squeeze for 2 unless you are tiny.  overall a great place!

1769688,50523921,2015-10-12,44921653,Jennifer,My husband and I were very comfortable staying at Rob's place. We had plenty of room and it was great to have our own bath. Everything was very clean. His kitchen had everything we needed. It was so easy getting everywhere on the buses that are close by. Rob lent us maps and even went out and bought us our own so we could write on it. This was our first airbnb experience and it was perfect!
189068,1194220,2012-04-28,509990,Joanne,My husband and I had a brilliant stay with Mary and Kingmond in April! Not only is their location fantastic (we were able to park our car FOR FREE and simply take direct public transit) but their home is warm and welcoming. I can't thank them enough for their patience waiting up into the wee hours of the morning for the two lost (and tired of camping) travellers who appeared on their doorstep! Would certainly stay there again.
467507,14611458,2014-06-23,3932547,Megan,Jennifer's place was fantastic I would highly recommend staying with her. The location was fabulous. The studio had everything we needed and more for a really enjoyable stay. A fantastic option for your next trip to SF.

6006768,460658260,2019-05-29,175491724,Jon,Wonderful location just outside the hustle of downtown San Francisco in a quiet and posh neighborhood. That said it's very easy to get downtown when you need to. Great for the executive who wants a retreat -  with a local Peet's coffee small restaurants and easy access to all amentities nearby.  Highly recommend.
11421711,277551120,2018-06-16,184228248,Christian,The room was very nice and clean; kitchen was also clean and easy to use. The neighborhood is calm and pretty close to the financial district (I only needed to take one bus to get there).  
15605090,223790370,2018-01-01,164830691,Jhania,Host wasn't intrusive. The room was pretty private  and very clean. I would definitely recommend it. The room was also really stylish and had a private bathroom which was definitely a plus. The only downside and maybe this is just me I would of loved a tv in the room to kill time between outings. Other than that it was in a great location and there were a lot of great restaurants and shops within walking distance
6015077,154437691,2017-05-24,26633042,Sandra,Die Wohnung ist sehr schön lässt keine wünsche offen. Die Lage war uns zu ruhig und der Nebel hin den ganzen Tag.
4718629,290565302,2018-07-14,63157377,Timitra,Josh is a terrific host; very responsive flexible (had to change date) friendly and helpful. The location isn’t central to the city but it’s easily accessible from the highway especially if you are coming from the south (avoids traffic and congestion). Parking is tight so having a small car is helpful. For the money paid it was worth the stay. Not a newer place but I don’t think the description reads as such.

13625546,106702421,2016-10-07,37685325,Ali,Audrey is a great host. She responds quickly to messages and was very welcoming. She offered breakfast each morning and the apartment is plenty large enough for a relaxed stay. Bart station is only 10 min walk away for connection to downtown. Highly recommended.
616204,39760012,2015-07-26,13055940,Elizabeth,"Jenny was very helpful and accommodating during the booking process when we made several changes to the booking. The apartment was easy to find and Jenny sent clear instructions. On arrival there were also instructions in the apartment with contact numbers and other useful bits of information. 

The apartment was clean the beds were comfortable and toiletries were provided. There is also WiFi although this only works in the living room and a TV with a few channels. 

The apartment is located in the middle of Chinatown which is good for public transport and walking to places but be aware it is often noisy and the apartment is not very soundproof (you can also hear neighbors from the floor above and below and the wooden floors seem to amplify everything within the apartment). 

The apartment was also cold on arrival and we couldn't find any central heating just an electric heater. Fortunately the weather warmed up otherwise this might have been a problem.

Overall Jenny was very helpful and the apartment is ok but probably not if you are a light sleeper or visiting when the weather may be a bit chillier. "
12999869,229296289,2018-01-22,133195179,Ray,Sarah and Pankaj were amazing hosts. I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in San Francisco.
28841178,507684263,2019-08-11,154039827,Lisa,The host provided accurate detailed instructions to get into the home; other guests were quiet as was the entire place. The attendants were also very nice and accommodating too. And loved the animals too. We felt very safe and comfortable the entire time. Just note that parking nearby can be quite difficult. Yes we'll definitely look to stay here again.

11998353,438889098,2019-04-17,112144176,Kelsey,The location is amazing. In walking distance of great restaurants and bars and quick driving distance to the sights of San Francisco. Cute park right across the street and it’s a quiet safe neighborhood. Jimmy and Maury were gracious hosts and we liked the roominess of our room - larger than we were expecting. They left great suggestions for places to eat in the area as well as the sights to see. Definitely worth the value.

I unfortunately was only there for a few days but it was a great starting point to dive into the startup-scene. Would always book again!
15162895,477688382,2019-06-28,7729654,Sarah,Great location and price! You can walk down to Fillmore with lots of shops bars and restaurants. Stayed here for a conference in the presidio and it was a perfect location.

11437509,295602343,2018-07-23,31651673,Mathieu,I spend a wonderful night at maria's place. The apartment is really nice and super clean. What I appreciate the most is the checkin everything is seamless you have codes its clear nothing to be worry about and you can checkin whenver you want. The space is very clean as well. The place is nice for a one or two nights stand but I don't recommend it for a longer and if you're a couple for example because there is a lot of other rooms and you can hear the noise of people living checking in and out. It's ok that normal but if you expect to have a quiet experience for an entiere week for example i dont think this place will be the best suit in my opinion. Its like a luxury/premium hostel. Anyway in my case for a one night stand jet lagged I slept like a baby and it was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Maria
7902889,104205750,2016-09-25,10360,Sunny,Awesome
16556338,257568145,2018-04-26,117030027,Kristen,Super accommodating and responsive. The bed was made when we arrived but we found crumbs in the sheets so we remade the bed with new sheets just in case. There was another guest staying on property and she was very kind. The drive from SF is a bit much with traffic but couldn't beat it for the price!
5027016,63669370,2016-02-25,57392602,Jay,Dan's place is in a Quite neighborhood very close to the beach. Walking distance to the muni. We will be back again!

It’s also very close to the Presidio and Golden Gate Park. Parking was easy. The place has a communal bathroom and kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet though there’s a bit of street noise from passing cars. I would go back.
2063077,13475520,2014-05-28,13867505,Alfredo,We had the most wonderful experience ever at this house!! Our host was amazing she made our stay unforgettable!! The house was much better than expected. It was beautiful comfortable and clean. Great master bed!! The bathroom was completely new and the shower was heaven. To make it even better the house had its own parking place. We loved the area too!! It is safe and has a fabulous grocery store the best gourmet pizza in San Francisco charming cafes and a lovely bookstore where we enjoyed a fabulous jazz concert. We would definitely stay here again if we had the chance!!
7697503,357241748,2018-12-09,41487266,Josie,We had to spent a night in SF due to the company party host in Golden Gate Park. We really enjoyed our stay in Dayne’s place. Dayne is super easy going to talk to he even made us drinks before we head out to kick off our night. He decorates the place very well with charm and taste. Love the bed! We also really enjoy meeting his dog Mox and it was a very neat experience to chill on the coach with a big Scottish Shepherd like a family : )
1578597,127240666,2017-01-16,111485061,Charlotte,Nice place had everything we needed and nice neighborhood. Had an awesome breakfast at Plow.

12437037,463697365,2019-06-03,261265216,Quentin,This was our first place that we rented from Airbnb and our first vacation in general. We were hesitant at first but our host was very kind and loved to chat it up with us about the local area which led us to some great restaurants. The area around the apartments has a great vibe and many many amazing food choices to choose from. Overall this was better than I could have expected and felt very comfortable our whole stay. The only downside I could put would be that the apartment is very easy to hear through and being on the bottom floor led us to hear a lot of footsteps and some potentially late night cleaning.
15346876,198225601,2017-09-28,5153012,Malcolm & Sharon,We stayed 4 nights in Kamal's apartment and had a enjoyed fabulous all round experience. The location is convenient for transport activities and food. The private room and ensuite was very comfortable and spacious. Kamal was an excellent host and provided great breakfast provisions. We thoroughly recommend Kamal's accommodation.
35642179,568745522,2019-11-24,108199969,Colt,Great location and very nice staff. The rooms are tiny but clean and totally worth the value. Loading zone right in front of the building but the garage is a few blocks away. Would absolutely recommend especially to those wanting to check out Chinatown.
25463,1759953,2012-07-21,2345540,Khiem,My wife and I had a great stay at Patrick's place. We stayed in a lovely room and Patrick was very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. Patrick gave us a lot of good advice and recommendations about what to see and where to eat.

9021715,193477252,2017-09-13,18697435,David,"Remi's place is well suited to a couple  family or business colleagues. It's close to public transport an easy uber trip down town and walking distance to the presidio the marina area and Fillmore. 

The house was clean comfortable and  a good size with a great kitchen plenty of room an easy to laundry and good wifi. 

Remi as a host was very helpful and was great to communicate with before  during and after the stay. 

Top place to stay in San Francisco. "

We had clear directions how to find the place and get in when we arrived late at night.
Very comfortable beds nice bathroom prefect modern kitchen and even washer and dryer.
When we arrived we found water bottle chocolate and cookies.
Plenty of parking on the street great location with 10 min drive to all attractions and center.
Thank you Alice to let us stay in your home.

5013816,75088898,2016-05-18,54472136,David,Fantastic! Great room in a lovely neighbourhood big comfortable bed amazing shower and felt very homely. Jeffrey was very welcoming and full of knowledge about the local area. You must get yourself a bottle of orange juice from the shop across the road best ever! We had an great time in Sf from start to finish.
295240,488224860,2019-07-14,77406402,Chris,We really enjoyed our time in San Francisco and staying at this AirBnB was the perfect base for our trip. The location is great and the apartment is lovely  having the outside space is a real bonus. The area is so peaceful it is hard to think you are just outside the city centre. Dan and Kristoffer provided a list of recommended  restaurants which was really helpful. Couldnt recommend this apartnement enough.
16407735,236244831,2018-02-18,54151192,Xiaokai,Servio is a great host. The place is lovely. I would recommend it to anyone!
955071,10314457,2014-02-12,1748735,Chelsea,As anyone probably knows San Francisco housing is super expensive. My boyfriend and I live in Santa Cruz but we like going to the city for 3 or 4 days just to have the experience of feeling more like a local rather than up and back in one day. So we definitely didn't want to stay in Daly City or South San Francisco where it's more affordable but outside of the action. We chose Ashir and Margaret's place because of the price and the location one block from the famous Haight Street and around the corner from Ashbury. But we didn't have our hopes up to be as pleased as we were. First of all like everyone else has mentioned Ashir and Margaret are wonderful hosts. They are ready to help you with anything (like how to figure out the satellite TV) and are always warm and friendly. But they have several rooms for rent and definitely give you the space to do your own thing. We also got lucky to have the entire basement apartment to ourselves. I don't know what it would have been like with another couple sharing the kitchen and bathroom with us. They even have a yard but it doesn't look like many people use it. It rained quite a bit when we were there so we didn't go out in the yard but I would think on a nice sunny day it might be nice to sit back there. And street parking wasn't as difficult to find as it is in the Mission where we stayed the last time. Yes you can hear people walking upstairs but not at unreasonable hours. And the room isn't huge. But us and our needs it was absolutely perfect and we look forward to staying there again. It's so close to everything. We walked to the DeYoung even in the drizzle and went thrift store shopping had a nice health food store nearby but mostly it was great for walking and people watching. Big hugs to Ashir and Margaret for making this possible for us.
25291283,435546456,2019-04-10,74835742,Rainer,Very kind host clean and comfortable room.
18012201,174104874,2017-07-24,6638126,Renee,The place was fine but if you're a light sleeper or heavy packer then this is not the place for you. The road noise is loud the bed shakes when the muni train goes by and the sun rises right in your face. The stairs make big luggage difficult. These weren't problems for me but I can imagine they might be for others. Also the separate bathroom was a pain. The 4 keys were already cumbersome but the 5th and lack of privacy was not ideal. A couple nights there were no lights on in the entryway or stairwell. Overall just mediocre.
8336042,58432898,2016-01-02,815557,Olivia,I booked this airbnb for my parents when they came to visit me over the holidays. Their stay at Matthew & Anastasia's place was really great. They really loved the studio the design the luxury and the spot and got along very well with the hosts. Matthew & Anastasia were very generous welcoming and very helpful. We got in a little late for our check in and they were really great about waiting for us and helping my parents settle in. They even got my parents some red wine chocolates and flowers to welcome them! I would more than recommend someone staying with them and I think my parents might stay there again in the future! 
1992217,33670675,2015-05-31,3190496,Cindy,Peter was most understanding and accommodating when our flight was 6 hours late.  His home is clean quiet and oh so big!!!!  We felt comfortable and welcome our entire stay.  Great location walking distance to Delores Park.  Although I've got to say walking back (uphill) is a bit challenging :)     Loved our visit and would definitely stay hear again!!
7972067,561131880,2019-11-08,63792627,Sara,Excellent location with a great backyard space!
4429527,535108231,2019-09-23,169058427,Ian,Definitely one of the best places we've had the pleasure of staying since we started using Airbnb. We felt right at home as soon as we walked in and would have loved to stay for weeks. It was great to have the kitchen so we could stock some food and save money by not eating out for every meal. There was amazing attention to detail while decorating the place and a hip aesthetic that made it as much an attraction of our vacation as it was a place to stay. Finally all of the guide books and pamphlets were instrumental in planning our days in SF as we we're pretty much winging it. We'd definitely stay again given the chance.
199480,39861840,2015-07-26,21038581,Jeremiah,Clean and beautifully decorated. Didn't get to see Peter himself but his house was lovely. Everything was ready for us when we arrived and there were clear instructions for the wifi and shower. My wife and I had a great time!
17551632,136420814,2017-03-10,42439123,Emilie,Le logement est indépendant tranquille et très bien équipé. Dans un quartier sûr et près de nombreux commerces restaurants bars. Le stationnement était relativement pratique malgré les difficultés dans cette ville. Susanna son mari et leur bébé Bart étaient vraiment très gentils très accueillants de très bon conseil et il était facile de communiquer avec eux. Ils ont fait tout leur possible pour que le séjour soit parfait. Le quartier est proche de plusieurs parcs ce qui est très ressourçant et offre une très belle vue sur toute la ville et à quelques minutes de marchés des quartiers du Castro et de Mission. En voiture tout se fait relativement bien pour visiter les choses plus éloignées et sinon les transports en commun sont largement présent. Merci mille fois à mes hôtes pour m'avoir fait profiter et aimé cette merveilleuse ville de San Francisco!
14549750,226103781,2018-01-08,161189751,Gustavo,El alojamiento esta bien ubicado  cerca del Golden Gate a 2 cuadras del parque en una zona residencial y tranquila.  Susanna responde a cualquier solicitud inmediatamente . Los ambientes son amplios pero el departamento es un poco oscuro porque no tiene ventanas en el living y si bien aclara que no tiene cocina tampoco tiene pileta del lavar lo que resulta un tanto incomodo
18107901,162199268,2017-06-19,108244135,Kalli,Great place has everything you need. Everything is well labeled with instructions. Jeff and Andrew are nice and welcoming and will help you with any questions you have!
12741695,230728772,2018-01-28,166280542,Karen,We enjoyed our stay
4077186,135344564,2017-03-04,5096710,David,The apartment is well provisioned stylish and comfortable. Perfect for our  needs.
10067187,141580164,2017-04-03,52704450,Mark,"Had a fabulous 5 night stay at the Chancellor. Wes gave a detailed explanation of what to do prior to arrival and the checkin is the same as hotel guests. 

While we were independent travelers the staff were very helpful to others around us. The little extras like the apples cookies fresh drinking water and tea and coffee were much appreciated and regularly used. The $25 food voucher gave us a great breakfast the first morning ( if we'd known how many pancakes would have shared and had a second breakfast!). 

The hotel is close to many restaurants and shops ( including an excellent Walgreens which gave us a quick and cheap breakfast most mornings). We got the MUNI passport for unlimited buses and trams plus the individually overpriced cable car which we used extensively for our 4 days. Transport literally gets you everywhere and it's all very close to the hotel. 

The room itself was good value - great bed some comfy chairs a large walk in storage and good bathroom. Also a functional refrigerator. 

Would stay here without hesitation. "
1148625,34864843,2015-06-13,7035473,Daniel,I was in town for a conference and Dennis's place provided a quiet and comfortable place to unwind. Dennis was very personable and accommodating.  Muni bus and rail were very close: another plus!
29062428,543901618,2019-10-08,147502115,Courtney,Great place to stay in San Francisco!
6600081,237644983,2018-02-23,5607646,Emily,Del's place is a sanctuary in the heart of SF! Her room and place was so comfortable and nicely presented it made for a very restful stay. Easily accessed by the Caltrain or Bart. Eating out was easy too the neighbourhood has plently on offer if downtown is not an option. I'd happily make a return trip Del and her family were Lovely to boot!
295240,192629822,2017-09-10,1018742,Rick,What a beautiful home!  I really enjoyed my stay at this special guest house in the hills above the Castro. Kristoffer and Dan's apartment is even better than the terrific listing suggests:  the location is perfect and a variety of sites and food/shopping/transportation options are within walking distance; the apartment is spacious clean and very well appointed; the bed is super comfortable; and the garden is magical.  Many of SF's best hidden staircases are within five minutes of the apartment. Finally Kristoffer and Dan couldn't have been more accommodating with my requests and were the perfect hosts.  I would return in a heartbeat and can recommend without reservation.
11023703,206722459,2017-10-26,109803023,Annika,Great stay! The place is incredible! So clean and trendy. Grocery store close by and the bed is the best ever!! Really enjoyed this one! Thanks!
23712427,461567624,2019-05-31,186164870,Emma,The location is very good and the inside of the house is also very good! We will live at Levon & Ashley's place when we visit SF again.
19824550,326628613,2018-09-22,34000704,Emily,Great location and friendly staff!
431632,468516394,2019-06-12,35761461,Oscar,"We had a great time at Lindsay and Brian’s place. Having lived in SF before it was in a great location to get all around the city by bus and walking. The space itself is quite large for an in-law unit and has most amenities you would want or need. Lindsay was very communicative upon arrival and allowed us in earlier when we needed it since the space was available.

As for the noise aspect of the place it really isn’t too bad. If you are particularly sensitive to noise I would definitely consider this but otherwise they provide earplugs and a white noise machine. They definitely are an active family and the noise tends to begin early and occasionally during the day with either visitors or running around. We managed fine especially being used to city living but it was a bit louder than we expected. 

Overall it was a perfect stay for what we needed and we would definitely try to stay here next time we were in the city."
715754,68115851,2016-04-02,26081948,Alana,This is the second time I've booked Deb and Greg's lovely apartment. Not only is their place an ideal spot for anyone visiting San Francisco they are wonderful attentive hosts.  They are very easy to communicate with and have every detail covered from bus routes to restaurant suggestions.  I would be excited to book their place again in the future.
9347891,317851705,2018-09-02,157373740,Breanne,Chris’s place was perfect for our trip. It was beautiful clean and stocked with all the necessities. It was so easy to get around town. We had a great experience!
3549398,339630078,2018-10-21,204060736,Peyton,perfect experience!
9225,28834385,2015-03-30,29387025,Kristen,Gae and Mel are such lovely hosts and incredibly welcoming.  We really enjoyed talking with them and sharing their amazing art.  The space was comfortable and perfectly located for our visit.  Oh and the roof deck is really sweet. We are grateful for the experience and hope to see them again!
1336998,26932643,2015-02-22,26881367,Ashley,Doug and Richard are awesome hosts! The room is well furnished clean and comfortable. They serve a delicious English-style breakfast in the mornings if you don't have breakfast plans. Their cats are very sweet and well behaved. We were impressed by their attention to detail and would stay here again.
23173614,494660592,2019-07-24,240680475,Rose,Very pleasant experience. Everything was simplified step by step. Andy keeps a very tidy and comfy home definitely would recommend.
6117147,337271023,2018-10-15,39225839,Agust,Great spot in a fun neighborhood. much larger than I thought it would be. Cool cafes and the beach just a short walk away. The deck in the backyard is awesome to enjoy breakfast and a morning coffee. Diane was a great hostess and communication was clear.
4902444,212609226,2017-11-18,63511320,J. Andy,Beds are very comfortable.
6453006,252462865,2018-04-10,29202174,Maryann,This our second time at Divya’s place and we are glad to be back. Divya is a great host she’s very easy to communicate and had very kindly arranged to let us check in early. The studio is nice and clean as always. We truly love the neighborhood and had a great time.
9130888,486504003,2019-07-12,4727190,Pauline,Michel’s place is well located close to a few good restaurants and cafes at the edge of Mission on a residential but busy street. A bus directly outside connects to downtown in 10 mins. Safe and secure place to stay and explore SF.
493889,81285127,2016-06-22,27802683,Jinying,The apartment is amazing clean and nice even better than the  pictures! Germaine is very kind and helpful and always there for us anytime we needed something. I strongly recommend anyone to stay at this place you won't be disappointed!
87640,550441898,2019-10-18,197181,Nia,Amazing garden and an incredibly peaceful place essentially in the city. We were really wow-ed.
18107460,155207369,2017-05-27,7140542,Yusuke,"This is a great place to stay for a single traveler who needs a clean place to sleep. The room is very small but it was big enough for me as I worked on weekdays outside and went out on weekends. 
The common area is very clean and well equipped. I first worried about the number of bathrooms but it was not an issue since most of the people had a different time schedule."
1393654,307614972,2018-08-14,201979469,Richard,We had a relaxed stay at Kevin's & he made us feel comfortable using his facilities including his kitchen & living room & provided us with our own fridge stocked with various food choices for breakfast.  He gave us lots of helpful tips on visiting SF & provided a useful map. Definitely recommended! 
1550913,196597472,2017-09-23,34630812,Florence,The place was clean well-maintained super modern and accessible! Everything is walkable. Seth and Alexa took care of everything we needed and made sure we were comfortable throughout our whole stay. Would not hesistate to stay here again and to recommend this place to friends and family visiting San Francisco!
27852325,331466278,2018-10-02,189418624,Leo,Great place accommodating host. The room has a lot of nice touches and Sylvia is a very great host! I already recommended it to a friend. There is a bus that takes you downtown but also plenty of things in the area (beaches parks museums). We had a great time...
258873,486475171,2019-07-12,12493160,Fabien,We had an excellent Time. The host is very kind and the location perfect to discover San Francisco
9258941,124795120,2017-01-02,64088151,Yordana,Great apartment. Everything was clean tidy and nice. We had a great time. Definitely recommended 
1301798,461553800,2019-05-31,143251771,Hannah,Great location! I would definitely recommend this location for any traveler. Yong also gave great recommendations for the best eats in the mission.
15605090,505781789,2019-08-09,198702304,Kelsey,Extremely clean lots of privacy and very comfortable. I stayed here for a couple months and loved it. Brian is very accessible and helpful and the location is great! A wonderful introduction to the City by the Bay.
21281846,474042971,2019-06-22,221701131,Peggy,"Kim’s room is warm and clean.
We will be glad  to visit here again!"
21799501,245830467,2018-03-23,6880959,Sarah,Extremely thoughtful host—lovely and convenient space and appreciated the thoughtfulness on all the little details! Overall Miranti made it so easy for us and I’m grateful
24853005,324767434,2018-09-17,30311997,Danny,Great place in a great location! Thanks Antonia and Nick!
191632,16269050,2014-07-24,17789744,Caitlin,Maria has an adorable studio in a wonderful area. The place was so welcoming with toiletries in case you didn't have your own! She was always extremely quick to respond to me and easy to communicate with. If I travel back soon I hope her place will still be open because I would love to go through Maria again! It was my first time using AirB&B and she made me feel safe and comfortable using it. Thanks so much Maria!
19753187,271598350,2018-06-01,2458330,Kjerstin,The location is absolutely amazing. Steps from Dolores Park and dozens of great restaurants cafes and nightlife. We had a wonderful time and felt very much at home. 
21745759,425137772,2019-03-17,138899180,Zhenzhen,Jennifer’s host is amazing! She is so nice welcoming making me feel comfortable like a home! I will be back next time! Highly recommended!
3093543,278324327,2018-06-17,1753266,Ellen,Lovely apartment with access to peaceful garden. Very clean well located and quiet. Mary was very responsive kind and helpful. Can get there from airport for $10 on BART and bus. Very easy transit. Can’t say enough positive things about my stay.  I would highly recommend this studio apartment and would stay again myself. 
598271,34104198,2015-06-04,883556,Alex,Fran is the consummate host and the location is great and the house and room beautiful. The little terrace off the deck is great for an early morning breakfast. I'd highly recommend Fran's place to anyone who'd like a true San Francisco experience in one of the most convenient locations in San Francisco.
20994570,258804472,2018-04-29,145031753,James,Great little spot to rest your head for the night while enjoying all the city has to offer. Quiet and close to the things you need and not far from transportation to all the action.
7327920,348650014,2018-11-14,40636209,Maria,"What an amazing place to stay in San Francisco! 
Corresponding with Katie was great she was very accommodating. The apartment was beautifully decorated in a neutral palette and plush fabrics.  The bed was super comfy and I loved all the pillows!  I need to get that pillow brand from Katie! The fridge and kitchen had all kinds of essentials like eggs and milk plus snacks.  Upon our arrival Katie had a small handwritten note wishing us well on our upcoming wedding. Everything you would need was available from bathroom toiletries to Katie’s directory of eateries and places to visit. The backyard views and patio seating made it hard to leave!  Oh and Toby was so adorable! By far the best place to stay in San Francisco."
591524,331435007,2018-10-02,211339090,Danielle,Jessica’s place is beautiful clean and comfortable! The place looks exactly as in the photos and I enjoyed my time there. Would definitely like to come back next time I'm in the city!
24099463,338156475,2018-10-18,34259206,Chiara,"Brian's house is clean comfortable and very very nice. We found everything we needed.
The position is quiet and offers a great view above San Francisco.
Brian has always been at our disposal for everything we needed. The communication with him was very quick and simple. Thank you Brian!"
1301798,21781854,2014-10-24,20209296,Arianne,I loved this place. It's in the middle of the city it's easy to get around (bart muni shops etc. are all very close)  and relatively quiet. The pictures don't do the room justice. It's very big and the bed is amazing. Yong is the best host you can imagine. Very relaxed yet very helpful and responsive. I highly recommend staying here when you're in town for an extensive period of time. 
38977592,562983615,2019-11-11,55428947,Lauren,We enjoyed our stay at Igor’s. It was in a safe location and was very clean. The complimentary breakfast was a great perk!
23751274,561130115,2019-11-08,23077849,Lisa,"Aislings place is just as pictured.  Very close to Bart and 101. Convenient location. Great restaurants and bars not far down the road. Beds a super comfortable and it's nice to have two showers if you're sharing the place. 

My only complaint was the noise. The street noise was fairly loud on Valencia and traveled through the apartment. If someone outside was talking on the sidewalk you could hear it in the living room on the other side of the apartment. If someone was upstairs or in the basement you could hear everything going on. 

This won't be an issue (I would hope) for others stays but while we were there we were told a contractor would come Monday at 5 to drill a few holes. He came on Tuesday and was there from 5 and was still there when we left for dinner at 8pm. Seems like this could have been planned better. It was noisy and disruptive to our stay."
6938818,188783427,2017-08-30,117922420,Alexandra,Der Kontakt mit Harris war einwandfrei. Das Zimmer war geräumig und sehr sauber ebenso wie das Bad auf dem Flur welches man mit anderen Gästen teilt. Auf dem Zimmer gab es sogar einen Kühlschrank und es bestand die Möglichkeit die Küche mit zu benutzen. Die Anbindung an den öffentlichen Nahverkehr war ebenfalls sehr gut. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt bei Harris sehr genossen!
18754189,234092344,2018-02-11,169199923,Robert,Barbara and Perry were very accommodating courteous and quick to respond. The apartment was perfect for us and our two young kids. We really loved the cleanliness and design of the apartment.  Our 3 yr old slept on the day bed and our infant in the provided pack and play. The space feels larger than the photos make it out to be. All rooms can be made private through sliding doors.  The area was great as well having both the beach and good restaurants within walking distance was a real treat.  We highly recommend this place to family and friends.
1931763,168071902,2017-07-08,137875402,Finnian,Great place and I loved the area by day but  things certainly got sketchy after sundown. We nearly saw a shooting right down the street and my friends car was broken into. If you have a car I would certainly put it in the lot over night and not leave anything valuable in it. Matthew is certainly not an intrusive host and it's not hard to feel comfortable in the room. 
27725598,435899220,2019-04-11,30395206,Sally,"Really enjoyed my stay at Valentino's he is a sweet host who knows San Fracisco so well I actually think he should suggest an Airbnb experience tour SF with Valentino :)
The place is lovely very well located it is a bit noisy (cable car passes by) the suite has its private bathroom which gives full privacy
the bed IS SUPER COMFORTABLE"
14990478,211387681,2017-11-12,49221276,Mary,This is as they describe a tiny apt suitable for one or an intimate couple comparable to the smallish hotel rooms you often find downtown in big cities. But there are many thoughtful details that remind you you are NOT in a hotel: delicious coffee healthy snacks real silverware and dishes sweet  decor and helpful getting-around-the-neighborhood tips. And the courtyard! It is at least twice the size of the cottage all fenced and quiet and nicely landscaped—it really makes this space. We sat out at the table on a cool November night and still felt we were at a nice resort. Free street parking right out front. 15 min easy drive to airport with simple access to freeway. Quick responses to my queries when I was trying to find out about food and drink options nearby. Very quiet for sleeping.
1665516,92473613,2016-08-08,28834324,Natasha,"This was both my fiance and I's first Air BnB experience and I admit I was little nervous! But upon arriving I knew everything would be just fine. We stayed at Adam & Roz's for the Outside Lands Festival. It was a great walking location to Golden Gate Park which is what we were looking for. We're both originally from the Outer Richmond neighborhood so we knew what we were looking for. Adam & Roz were over the top accommodating and we would stay there for 2017 in a heartbeat! We requested an early check-in and while they couldn't quite get the unit cleaned in time they still allowed us to drop off our bags before. 

We always felt like Adam & Roz were available via text/phone/or a walk upstairs. They are the type of people who you want to be friends with and we could have talked with them for hours if we didn't have a festival to go to and if Roz hadn't just gotten a new washing machine to play with!

The unit was spacious and had a kitchenette that we didn't use frequently but if we were staying there longer we would have definitely taken advantage of. They had thought of everything logistically (even included Clipper cards to reload if you need them) and proudly display a certified short term rental certificate in the kitchen. There was a very sweet guestbook and loved reading what others wrote about the place.

We felt very well taken care of and would definitely come back again.

4077186,20915523,2014-10-07,8303245,Alexis,"Danielle was the perfect host.  We communicated with ease about our arrival.  Her apartment is fantastic and exactly how she states in her profile.  We drove and I asked her about parking she said there was plenty in the neighborhood which was true.  We had no trouble.  We loved staying we will come back!  Thanks for having us!

10883329,113423067,2016-11-12,60859758,Jyotish,Great location private.  Rooms can probably use an upgrade.  No AC  which forced me to keep the windows open at night which was noisy.  Overall okay but probably won't be staying again.  
4959980,548473114,2019-10-17,52404698,Linda,Was great place! Super clean felt like home!
1043282,149930872,2017-05-06,27850041,Outi,John's place is elegant and comfortable. There is breakfast provided Netflix and some other channels and the most comfortable bed. We felt very welcome. Also the Castro area where the house is is trendy and worth seeing.
4121691,265062539,2018-05-15,133619733,Amy,"This apartment was so cute clean and perfect for my visit. Absolutely love the natural light. 
Away from the hustle of San Fran but only a ~20 minutes Uber ride from downtown to get touristy. 
The beach is a 5 minute walk!
Great place I highly recommend."
598271,2896566,2012-11-16,616545,Morten,"Staying with Fran was great. I enjoyed being in her house which is beautifully located high up on Potrero Hill with a great view over the city. I always turned around and looked at the SF skyline when coming home in the evenings.

Fran is a great host and her house is decorated with taste (southern style) the room had enough space and a view over the city. Everything is new clean quiet and perfect to relax after an intense day in the city.

Chatting with Fran has always been great she is very flexible welcoming and friendly.

I can recommend staying at this place."

21123508,199979974,2017-10-03,11950288,David,"My stay was pretty straightforward - my room was spacious and clean Internet was fast and location was pretty central to the city (though my stay did involve walking through the Tenderloin at night which was kind of scary). The room had a simple layout but everything you could need. Communication and instructions for check-in were straightforward.

Only thing that could've been improved was that my door was actually jammed when you tried to close it such that it couldn't be shut all the way (and so couldn't technically be locked)."

Sehr ruhige Lage und mit der Bahn ist alles problemlos zu erreichen."
2736358,31161032,2015-05-03,24767705,Kubra,First of all the neighborhood was very nice. Victorian style houses were wonderful. We found everything as described previously so there were no surprises. Sara made us feel cared from the first moment and was very helpful on our last day which we appreciated a lot. She was always checking our requests immediately and tried to solve them as soon as possible. Even her dog is very welcoming! The garden is beautiful and it is shiny in the apartment.  We even had games in our cupboard! :)

Great for business travelers!!"
14179987,351722033,2018-11-23,3013147,Brigit,This is a family-owned MOTEL.  Also be aware you may not get a room with a full kitchen.
1237143,512915500,2019-08-18,47446764,Petr,Susanna was a great host. Very responsive to our messages before and during trip and also available in person whenever we needed help. The place is in a great location and our family really enjoyed it though our 9 day visit.
7143032,50882485,2015-10-15,25096074,Avina,Great location for shopping etc. Very clean. Be aware that the apartment doesn't have an AC if you are visiting during the summer months and the bed is only a full size bed. I believe the host posted this but I didn't pay attention. Also make sure to bring your own soap etc since this is not provided.
17778664,160592956,2017-06-14,131116269,Kanjana,Heather's place is a perfect place in a quiet neighborhood. Lots of good place for breakfast lunch and dinner in a walking distance.

4896087,54093056,2015-11-16,16671687,Jacki,"Pros: 
Great location. 
Adequate space for 3 people.

Cons: 
It’s my understanding that CA law requires all bedrooms to have emergency escape windows for fire safety. I doubt this apartment meets that 5.7 sq. ft. requirement which includes being no more than 44” above the floor. The one bedroom window was too high and too small to get through in the event of a fire. 

None of the safety features listed were present when we arrived. I spent the first two days exchanging emails asking the owner to remedy that. His first suggestion was ""Just don't leave the stove unattended! :)"" On the second day an elderly woman arrived late at night and HANDED ME a smoke detector which my husband managed to temporarily install himself with one screw and a kitchen knife. I looked for but did not find a fire extinguisher. 

Apartment is mostly below grade accessed behind the building shown in photo #21. Or maybe it's just located in the space between the garage and mechanical rooms either way there are few windows. The photos with the narrow exterior corridor (#23 & 24) shows the entrance to the unit.  It’s VERY dark inside requiring lights at all times. Note how none of the shutters are open in the photos there are no views. The one small bedroom window is at ground level and you look up under a deck a few feet away the window by the table looks out on to a metal door and alley/ corridor.   The living room window looks out to the “shared garden courtyard” which contains one bench with broken slats that couldn’t be sat on… not that you would want to sit there because the view was of a locked metal door under steps and down a narrow corridor (unfortunately it doesn't appear that they allow me to post photos in this review). 

The toilet ran the entire 4 days... and nights. I notified the owner AND a co-owner who showed up. In the end we turned off the water at night. 

There was no trash can except for a small one in the bathroom. None in the kitchen area. So we had 4 days of trash sitting around in little bags on the floor. "
5299538,329822825,2018-09-29,31469599,Hongrui,Very stylish place and feels like a university dorm. Will once again stay in the future next trip to San Francisco!
7547105,205285308,2017-10-21,4756250,Artie,This space is small and sweet very quiet off a nice private garden. The room is efficient and nicely appointed with everything a traveler needs. I stayed there four nights and felt quite at home -- and grateful for the hospitality. I plan to look for this spot next time I come to San Francisco.
19478755,272646060,2018-06-03,179715603,Yujin,"Kathy the host  is very kind. 
She gave me a warm welcome
Whenever I came she greeted me warmly. I stayed at home. She always answered requests quickly. The house is incredibly clean. The room is larger than the picture. The neighborhood is very safe. I highly recommend this place. :)!!!! "
15132855,245556160,2018-03-22,120497481,Louisa,Erin and Howard have a wonderful place in the most perfect location in San Francisco.  They are great hosts and the little touches relating specifically to us were fantastic. (Thanks for the vegemite - we had been missing it in our travels).  If you are looking for a place that is welcoming and close to all that San Francisco has to offer this is the place for you.
12328003,224310254,2018-01-02,37453406,Eva,Quiet and comfortable place to stay in. Excellent hosts.
5558933,32991939,2015-05-24,31405545,Jeanne,Rob/Walt were very friendly. They always answered my calls and emails promptly. The apt. was immaculate and very cozy. The neighborhood was within easy walking distance to a shopping district that had restaurants grocery and shops.  Public transportation that could easily  get you anywhere was 1/2 block away.  We would definitely stay there again if we get the chance.
16162542,198850076,2017-09-30,132727425,Steven,Clean nice apartment. Would stay again.

13970165,125427747,2017-01-05,6467834,Dee,"David was nice to be so accommodating of our late check-in and Bruce was a big sweetie. The home is clean modern and super high-tech; think motion-sensor lights that light up your path for you on the stairs! ""Stacked with amenities"" is a more than accurate description of the room and bathroom including all the useful technological functions you could imagine needing (phone chargers; dimmable lights; a small Dyson heater which was definitely appreciated for the chillier nights in the basement). Bernal Heights is a great neighborhood to be in as well (hills and all)!"
9752333,202092263,2017-10-09,25351769,Mary,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Peg' s beautiful apartment.  The  location is ideal for exploring many areas of SF and her hospitality is second to none.  The apartment is huge and so thoughtfully appointed  we wished we could have stayed much longer.  So many lovely touches: the very comfortable bed heated towel rack beautiful art work serene garden deck ... it was just perfect! We look forward to our next visit!
8524982,69440659,2016-04-11,9109157,Barbara,Immaculate and beutifully furnished room. Very thoughtful proactive and nice hosts. Quiet yet very close to all amenities location. Loved our stay and would always consider coming back here as first best when in san Francisco.
18767723,492926178,2019-07-21,129264436,Chen,A spotlessly clean apartment in a quiet neighbourhood with good access to public transport linking Union Square and Fisherman's wharf. The bed was comfortable. There is a small kitchen with complimentary breakfast items and kitchen appliances. The owners were very friendly and gave advice about worthwhile places to visit in San Francisco. I would definitely recommend this apartment to other visitors to SF.
191632,521232379,2019-08-31,53024815,Brant,Maria really knows how to make you feel at home! She was extremely responsive clear and helpful during our stay. Would happily recommend to anyone needing a. lovely little place in SF.
4632133,554635281,2019-10-26,284293642,Margaret,Best thing about this property is free parking off road.  And location...we walked everywhere.  Bed was comfortable.  But everything else was either mediocre or not good.  Breakfast croissants were stale.  Smokers very annoying.  Had to ask for shampoo soap towels and pillows.
2272343,410160579,2019-02-09,16227328,Eva,"Rob’s house located in a quite street and easy to transit to downtown. 

Rob responded quickly and gave us travel advice before we arrived SFO. It’s really a useful information for us. 

Recommend everyone to visit Rob’s house if you have plan in San Francisco."

504146,112139322,2016-11-04,79881329,Aaron,Place is very nice. Close to the marina and not to far of a walk to pier 39. Had everything you needed. Host was very friendly and we had a wonderful time.
719431,3347097,2013-01-14,487899,Enrique,Phil's place was exactly what I was looking for. It was clean quiet with ample street parking and free coffee to boot! I would highly recommend staying at his place.
2188561,23514405,2014-12-02,16092073,Allison,Nina was a great host and made checking into her home so easy. She left me detailed instructions to the operations of her home and was very easy to contact. Pictures are accurate and the house is very well kept and even nicer in person. We loved all the details of the home from the well appointed library to the flip open windows that expose a wonder view of San Francisco from the second floor.  It is a very nice clean home and accommodated our family perfectly. The location is a perfect and we would definitely stay there again.
3093543,29974958,2015-04-15,7715394,Josie F,Great place! Highly recommended great neighborhood with plenty of restaurants shops and convenience stores. Within walking distance to golden gate park and presidio. Public transportation is easily accessible even though we didn't need it.  Massimo was very attentive and responded to any questions right away. We were able to park our rental in his garage. Stay here!!
23883511,477708159,2019-06-28,268661611,Kristin,Arjun's clean and quiet place is ideal and high value for the price. I found parking easily and was accommodated for a quiet business week in SF. If you are on a budget you will find a xomfortable bed and clean bathroom awaiting you.
22586319,322678522,2018-09-13,115564478,Theo,"The unit is super small but the location is not bad it’s about 6 miles from DTSF. They should probably add some more amenities like a Mirror and small desk in the bedroom. Also there’s no TV ! 

However Jean was a great Host she made herself available for us the whole time we were there. If you just need a place to sleep and take a shower this place is for you !"
242008,64133323,2016-02-29,20945721,Gulmohor,Jake was an absolutely wonderful and attentive host. We enjoyed staying at his place in SOMA which was really cute and close to lots of interesting places in SF :) I would definitely recommend staying there for a weekend getaway in the city or just visiting SF 
8274904,525364140,2019-09-07,178884422,Maxwell,"My girlfriend and I’s stay at Saundra’s place elevated our trip to San Fransisco in such an incredible way. We were blown away with our experience here.

First off Saundra and her husband are the best hosts you can ask for. Thoughtful kind respectful they gave great recommendations were flexible and offered privacy while opening up to us. 

Second their house is so beautiful. It’s big and spacious decorated with intricate artwork and rugs. It is located within walking distance to the best neighborhoods and spots in the city. We walked to our favorite restaurants such as Nopa The Mill La Taqueria Lolo and others. Our favorite part of SF Mission Dolores Park was a short walk away. The room offered privacy as it felt like we were in our own world within the house. Such an elegant house and neighborhood!

I will be recommending this AirBnB to all my friends and family it was such a treat to stay here."
17767863,438447338,2019-04-16,3069802,Andreas,Cool place!
1699390,270240881,2018-05-28,21318085,Lydia,Natasha and Kai were amazing host! When we arrive to leave our baggage and head out for the day we were greeted and shown to our room. We got to visit for a short time and we were out for Carnaval most of the day. They are a wonderful couple and are quick to respond to any questions. The house is a WOW! Loved it and the Bed was amazing! With that fresh linen feeling slept like a baby!! On the second day of Carnaval the long parade took a toll on us so we went and took a nap and ended up just sleeping through the night... very comfortable bed! We never had a problem with the “Shared Bath” it was always available when we needed it. So many places to eat within walking distance. We went late night for coffee and pie at Mission Pies...amazing walnut pie! We were able to find parking just half a block away on Saturday night after meter hours and left it there until we left before 9am Monday morning. We were actually able to park in SF free all weekend!! We enjoyed our stay and our host and we would love to return! Beautiful bird Pooh and Cat Max didn’t bother us a bit. 
14422371,448084883,2019-05-04,256757890,Linda,A very great stay loved how you can cook your own meals and how nice the space was. Friendly hosts as well we would come again. :)

13652971,145526854,2017-04-18,8733417,Anthony,"David's place was absolutely phenomenal. Manuel and I stayed there for two nights only but the hospitality of Bruce and David (and other friends) were enough to make us fall deeply in love with the city. 

This was also Manuel's first time staying at a Airbnb of shared space and he was very impressed. Clean beautiful and a fun environment that's also a close Uber or BART away from the city. The top of Bernal Heights which is a short walk from David's also hosts an incredible view of the city.

Advice for travellers: book with Bruce and David you won't regret it."

I would recommend staying here to my friends and family."

Lainie and Charlie are the warmest host I have met while staying on AirBNB.

Lainie react to our reservation very fast and made sure we have a parking and everything we need.

There are two rooms with comfortable beds and a big shower room.

Outside there is a nice garden amazing to open the day with coffee there.

You have anything in one block walking from food to laundry and the streetcar to the center of the city is two minutes walk.

It called here the sunset district you won't find better sunsets around.

Thank you Lainie and Charlie for a great hosting and experience."

57561,49027924,2015-09-30,42933650,Hans,"Das Apartment entsprach von der Lage der Grösse und der Ausstattung unseren Erwartungen und den Beschreibungen. Wir  hatten genug Platz um uns auszubreiten und uns für die 4 Nächte wohl genug gefühlt. Theo hat uns ca. 2 - 3 Tage vor Ankunft die Details betreffend Parkieren und Schlüsselübergabe durchgegeben so dass wir mit einem guten Gefühl nach SF gefahren sind (es handelte sich um unsere erste Airbnb Erfahrung). Da ich bereits im August gebucht hatte war ich wegen des relativ lange fehlenden Feedbacks ein wenig nervös geworden.
Wir möchten Theo hier nochmals danken dass wir bei ihm übernachten durften. Trotz einiger Abstriche haben wir die Zeit genossen. Da wir fast CHF 900.-- für die 4 Tage bezahlt haben erlauben wir uns aber einige kritische Bemerkungen zum Aufenthalt die uns aufgefallen sind.
Das Bett ist sehr sehr klein mit ca. 130 cm auf 190 cm (nach unserer Messung) sowie sehr hart (das Schlafzimmer wäre an und für sich gross genug für ein Kingsize Bett). Wir hatten Bettmässig mit Abstand die schlechtesten Nächte während unserer 3-wöchigen USA Rundreise. Die Wohnung und das Schlafzimmer ist jedoch leise d.h. wir hörten praktisch nichts vom Umgebungslärm. Nur Theo mit seiner Familie welche im oberen Stock wohnen waren hörbar (Schritte sowie Spülung und Wasserleitung).
Die Küche war zweckmässig aber verhältnismässig spartanisch eingerichtet (z.B. fehlte uns ein Toaster). Was uns aber mehr störte war die fehlende Sauberkeit der Küche (z.B. dreckige Pfanne dreckiger Backofen sehr dreckige Ablagefläche auf Kühlschrank dreckige Schubladen und Tischsets). Es wird jedoch keine Cleaning-Fee verrechnet so dass wir nicht beurteilen können ob dies der übliche Standard bei Airbnb Wohnungen ist. Das Geschirr und Besteck selber war sauber da diese ja in der Regel mit dem Geschirrspüler gereinigt werden.
Der kleine Badezimmerschrank über dem Waschbecken ist leider mit (zu) billigem Material zusammengeschustert worden und hat aufgrund der Feuchtigkeit bereits Schimmel angesetzt. Das ist umso bedauerlicher da es ansonsten keine Ablagemöglichkeiten gibt. 
Vom Esstisch hätte man einen wunderbaren Blick auf den Garten wenn nicht das dreckige Fenster und die grosse Unordnung im Garten den Blick etwas trüben würden. Hier besteht grosses Potenzial ein Bijou daraus zu machen.
Der Teppich im gesamten Wohnbereich hat die besten Tage hinter sich (Flecken). Ein Austausch in der nächsten Zeit wäre allenfalls zu überlegen. Die Wohnung selber macht etwas einen kalten sterilen Eindruck (trotz der einen grünen Wand im Wohnzimmer).
Die Gastgeber selber haben wir nie getroffen. Es bestand jedoch jederzeit das Angebot sie bei Fragen oder Problemen zu kontaktieren.
Wir haben die Übernachtung wie eine Art Hotelangebot angeschaut und hatten aufgrund der Höhe der Bezahlung eine gewisse Erwartungshaltung. Vielleicht ist diese bei Airbnb-Angeboten nicht angebracht da es sich um private Anbieter handelt. Dementsprechend sind die obigen Bemerkungen einzuordnen.
WiFi hat perfekt und mit einer schnellen Verbindung funktioniert.
Den TV haben wir nie benutzt. Unschlagbar ist das Angebot das Auto direkt vor dem Haus parkieren zu können (war für uns ein wichtiges Kriterium). Wir haben es sehr geschätzt. Die ÖV haben wir nie benutzt (ausser Cable Car im Zentrum)."

15270469,472982749,2019-06-20,61420201,Alice,Loved Michele’s place! We stayed in her basement which use to be her preschool now turned AirBnb. Michele was extremely sweet and took the time to make sure we felt comfortable at her place. She had some very interesting art pieces in her upstairs area. There is a full kitchen and a half bath (the shower was in the upstairs bathroom but it was not a problem at all nor did we feel weird going upstairs to use it).  The TV only had PBS but we watched movies/shows on our laptops anyways. Plenty of space for 2-3 people. Great stay in SF and well worth the money. Easily one of the sweetest hosts I’ve ever met and I’ve stayed in many airbnbs! Thanks again Michele!

1226596,107830273,2016-10-12,93663654,Peter,Leslie and Gio's was a great place to stay in the city. Within walking distance of a BART station as well as bus stops. They were really helpful and even gave us tips on places to check out around their neighborhood (super helpful!). The room is exactly as advertised. Really clean and is in a quiet neighborhood.

8739,124776464,2017-01-02,5097396,Raquel,Ivan was excellent! Incredibly warm and welcoming. His apartment is beautiful and cozy. Had a wonderful time. 
13293285,302617298,2018-08-05,19707145,Ivan,The studio is awesome Vlad and Ira provided everything we needed.  Perfect location walking 5 minutes north to Muni N line train stop and 5 minutes south you can find supermarket and Muni bus #7.  Temperature in SF is a bit low this summer the  dedicated central heat makes us feeling exceptional warm while staying inside. 
12987777,78726938,2016-06-08,59054679,Jon,My parents and I had a great stay at this property.  The apartment was very nice and clean and Sharon was a great host. The location can not be beat!  Sharon always responded in a very timely manor to any question we had for her and she really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay! We will definitely try to book this same property again if it is available on our next visit to San Francisco! 
12212013,338511405,2018-10-19,65549248,Soo Chia,Jason's place might be small but it is equipped with all the amenities you need. It is very clean stylish and well maintained. It's also easily accessible located right behind painted ladies with a lot of eateries nearby within walking distance. Besides Jason is very responsive. We highly recommend this place (:
4902729,276443636,2018-06-13,30768324,Justin,Nice place. Smaller than I expected and definitely in a part of town I would not want to walk through at night alone.

14773919,275746777,2018-06-11,42338427,Natasha,If you’re looking for a good value and beautiful place to spend some time in San Francisco look no further! Terry’s place is in a gorgeous neighborhood and is only a short walk away from cute restaurants bars and the MUNI. We didn’t have a car during this stay but we found the combination of walking using the MUNI and Uber to be sufficient ways to get around. The views on this patio are remarkable and the home itself is clean and so comfy! Terry and Allan were amazing hosts and gave us tips on the public transit and places to go. I would recommend this Airbnb 100% and will definitely try to book it again on our next visit to this beautiful city!

1992217,202516529,2017-10-11,25483799,Katrin,We stayed 2 nights at Peter's house and had a great time. It's located in a nice and quiet area. The public transportation is just a few meters away from his home. The room with included bathroom is well decorated and comfortable. Both mornings we got up early so he set up the breakfast table for us. It was very delicious. We highly recommend him as a host.
10385321,127866167,2017-01-21,101818001,Reyna,The apartment is almost like a hotel! Robert is a very accommodating host. A little bit tricky for those who have a car as there isn't secure parking. Otherwise I would highly recommend this place. 
6628985,52594538,2015-10-31,43898758,Andrea,"Sylvie was a wonderful host! She was there when we arrived to greet us and show us around the room. We saw her a few times throughout our stay and she always asked if we needed anything or had any questions.
The room was exactly as described. It was nice to have a mini fridge available to keep bottles of water and other drinks cold. Bed was very comfortable!
Location was pretty central for anywhere we wanted to go. Easy to catch an Uber and there are several bus lines that run within a few blocks.
We would definitely recommend this room!"
19417708,431253197,2019-03-31,20445423,Mike,Great host!
845480,28017233,2015-03-16,27804678,Anthony,We stayed 4 nights at Delores house. We had a very good time. Nice neighborhood nice house with kitchen reserved for guests large bedroom and bed. Absolutely perfect! And San Francisco... *_* if I come back and I will! I'll probably stay there again. Thank you.
15010218,289201577,2018-07-11,197756001,Meg,Good place for a quick stay. Thought sheets were dirty on the first night but hosts explained their dryer had broken and supplied us with a new pair. Note that it is right next to a highway with no AC so if you are a light sleeper it’s not the best option. Bedroom doors can only lock from the inside and other Airbnb guests occupy several other rooms on the property so was nervous about stolen articles but nothing happened. 
191632,290054593,2018-07-13,168247177,Laura,This studio was perfect for our stay in San Francisco. As a first timer to the city it was wonderful to be in the heart of the Haight and have a more local experience than staying downtown. Maria’s space was really great with lots of adorable touches and thoughtful offerings. We appreciated the coffee/tea and creamers fridge dishes soaps iron/board q-tips (hubby was thrilled about this small touch that he’d forgotten to pack) and clean space. Maria is an artist who even had needlepoint keepsakes available for an an affordable extra purchase. Also the space felt very private and safe in the back of the property. We just loved our time here and would recommend to others!

1434425,306593197,2018-08-12,201178147,Eliza J,I loved staying at David's place and the location is ideal. Room is comfortable and spotless. I didn't feel comfortable using the kitchen or common areas and the shared bathroom 4-ways was a bit much but otherwise I would recommend this spot for comfort overall. 
8520295,206293672,2017-10-24,54831698,Hanna,Jills appartment is absolutely wonderful. Jill has done a great job to describe how everything works so you don’t have to worry. The place and Jill is the essence of “Hygge” which in Danish means warm cozy and welcoming. The appartment is very close to public transportation and Jill has put out plenty of guidebooks and a very good overall guide to the area. We enjoyed our stay very much.
27082654,427490694,2019-03-23,26487508,Helene,We stayed at Nina's home for 3 months as our relocation abode from Europe. We couldn't have wished for a better transition staying in an authentic San Franciscan house and on a stunning and safe location. Nina was absolutely fantastic super fast to respond and always offering help. We loved it so much we would have stayed there permanently. Thank you Nina
3354928,22346558,2014-11-03,3424779,Stan,"This place is appropriately described as Glamour with a Capital ""G"". Great location in Japantown. Parking was not as challenging and easy to access downtown Nob Hill or west SF. Tan was available and responsive.  Appliances were great. Only 2 drawbacks were cooking/seasonings lacking in kitchen and sound traveled with ease (but given in SF). Thanks for a fast last minute rental arrangement!"

4902855,402831115,2019-01-19,82900183,Roger,I am writing this review after leaving the residence today for a conference nearby in Jan 2019. The residence is mostly as pictured however every where is a bit less white / clean as I imagined. When I walked in the residence has a feel of a hostel since there is a shared bathroom/shower except the bedrooms are completely private in this case. I would like to extend my gratitude to the host for giving me the option to check-in early though I ended up not needing it since my flight was very delayed. In general I think it was a great value for the location and I would probably stay again. There were four issues that detracted me from a more positive experience: 1) The WiFi is my biggest complaint. I heavily rely on WiFi to do my work but it just disconnected too many times or when it worked it was too slow; 2) Much like the rest of SF my room smelled like MJ especially when I was near the vent in my room. Not sure if the smell was from outside or another tenant in the building but it did give me a headache. 3) I woke up a few times each day because it was a bit noisy from both the traffic outside and also other tenants in the rooms making noise. I did bring earplugs but I felt like the noise was not too excessive for me to use them. 4) The location of the residence made me feel a bit unsafe when I returned at night. It's in a low to moderate traffic area but I felt like one block over was a scary since there were barely any lights.
3416013,463143226,2019-06-02,221315539,Karen,"Emily has a beautiful home and we were made to feel very welcome by her and her family (cats included). It was really great chatting with Emily and Jason and they are lovely hosts!

There are lots of great local cafes  coffee shops and restaurants nearby and Emily’s recommendations were very helpful.

The home is in a good spot to explore San Francisco and has amazing views of the bay and city.

Emily was undertaking a big garden project whilst we were there and this shared space will be incredible when finished.

Our room was clean bright and airy with a large comfortable bed. The bathroom we shared with the other Airbnb room was very nice."
33713266,489449769,2019-07-16,52251349,Akayla,The space of very clean and quiet. The code locks are very convenient and access to a washer and dryer was awesome. Located close to a muni and bus stop

10929061,484325118,2019-07-08,35335199,Marie-Christine,"The room is way nicer then what you see in pictures. It is very clean and Cherryl have added little details that made us happy (towels water bottles soap etc.). The inconvenient was the bathroom because its only a curtains for more privacy i would suggest a sliding door. We shared the shower with the room next door. The house is beautiful made us feel juste like home it is very cozy. The bed was very confortable and we were happy about that! We found that the place is well situated we always took the muni bus to go around the city very easy access (5$ illimited for the day with the Muni App.). We had breakfest a several time at House of bagels and Cinderrela Cafe. Close walking to the airbnb. We suggest this place to visit San Francisco!
Thank you Cherryl! We loved your home!"
992913,17098937,2014-08-07,16180591,Yuqi,We had an excellent 2-night stay in Irina's apartment. The apartment is in a great location (walking distance to lots of must sees). If you are a  foodaholic it would be the best place for you to stay. You can find a lot of great restaurants without effort. The host was accommodating and flexible. We had everything we needed. Amazing~ 
17237462,426360382,2019-03-20,240487850,Winter,It’s quiet and comfortable. The room seems a little bit old others are the same as the pictures. There are also many groceries nearby. You can walk to BART station. It's good for me.
40138,204357175,2017-10-17,25978673,Aaron,"Ay is the perfect host: very kind caring & has always great recommendations for SF.

You instantly feel welcomed in her charming apartment. The guest room was perfect for my week in San Francisco. It was clean and the bed extremely comfortable.

The location is also great with a bus stop (to explore the city) ATM and supermarkets just around the corner.

I will definitely stay at her place again on my next trip to this great city."

The house was beautiful and the interior design was completely thought out and tied the house together. My favorite room was the living room upstairs. The window looks out onto San Francisco and it was beautiful during the daytime or night. Every  room was clean and organized when I arrived and the instructions Mitch provided was clearly detailed and convenient. The heated toilet seat upstairs was a major plus and the bedrooms were very spacious. The area is very calm and safe and there was plenty of parking in front of the location. Thank you Mitch for your service and opening up your spectacular home to my family and I.

The place was tastefully decorated and very clean. The shared bathroom was never an issue. The linens were comfy and we loved the house slippers that were provided. 

Location: many places nearby to explore if you don't mind walking the hills. There's a great area of restaurants minutes away via Uber.  

Overall a very pleasant stay! The home is so quiet too!"

21555212,448987936,2019-05-05,148480903,Heath,if you are looking for the relatively cheaper accomodation this is a viable operation. its located in probably the most hippe area of the city.
13084734,459857260,2019-05-27,41334031,Adam,Love this place! Very comfy and cozy. I love to hike and it’s within walking distance to Sutro Baths and Lands End. I also forgot to pack a few things but luckily there is a Walgreens just down the street. Fridge and microwave came in handy. Guides was provided if you are wondering what to do in the city. I was able to iron my clothes before watching Hamilton. Loved coming back to a comfy bed and Netflix. This place had everything I needed and I would definitely stay here again!!

1598872,127737115,2017-01-20,559836,Julia,"This was my third stay in Teresa's lovely home and I've  been so spoiled staying here--I find it hard to want to stay anywhere else when I come into town! As I've said before Teresa's home is absolutely stunning and immaculately clean and comfortable. And everything in her home has her personal touch. I always make it a point to cook in her kitchen at least one night. I was traveling with a work partner so Teresa assembled a high quality air mattress that looked like a regular bed--headboard and all! 

The location is perfect with MUNI and BART nearby. Plenty  of hip restaurants and a variety of grocery/produce markets are in walking distance. The cherry on the cake on this trip was getting to see her and chatting for a little bit. I realized that I hadn't brought a coat with me for a formal event. She was so sweet and offered to loan me one or her own. Best home and fav host in SF!"

9225,81336,2010-08-19,180937,Kirby,Gae was very responsive and friendly when I picked up the keys from her before my stay. She gave me a great tour of the apartment and there was a lot of gorgeous and unique art all over! The location is a bit tough for getting into the heart of the city (in case it's your first time to SF) but I was able to take the 10 or 22 bus most places or call a taxi no problem. I think I misunderstood how the house would be arranged as the floor was definitely private but the owners were upstairs most nights which you could hear at times. Otherwise - the flat was great!!
11013337,202038814,2017-10-09,10946253,Lynette,House was very nicely decorated and very clean.  Nice quiet neighborhoold and we loved having a place to park!

7949624,68206959,2016-04-02,13412675,Julien,Thanks for the welcome Rania! It was great to have a host who knows the neighborhood so well and could point me to nice areas to visit and dine. If you stay there follow Rania's recommendation and check out the French bistro Chez maman and the organic Mexican restaurant Papito. The room was charming and cozy. You'll also get a nice view from San Francisco from up on Potrero Hill.

20852099,282909562,2018-06-28,56681833,Jake,It’s very clean super affordable and very close to the airport. It’s not in a lively sf neighborhood but it’s good if you are heading out of the city
41055,480015738,2019-07-01,1157750,Shelley,We loved all the cool Indonesian decor and the friendly kitty! The home has lots of stuff in it -- felt more like staying at a friend’s while they are out of town rather than a place set up just for vacation rentals. Location was great! Very walkable and close to transit parks and the lively Castro district. Parking in the neighborhood was challenging the busy weekend we visited but we expected that. During the week street parking is by permit. Chas got us temporary permits for the days we needed them at just $6/day which was really helpful for being able to park closer especially on our arrival and departure days.
14773074,241303092,2018-03-08,32747725,Taeeon,The BEST place ever! Book here and Stay here! His place is very spacious and clean with great view. There is good condition of private bathroom as well. I feel really comfortable to stay for 3 nights. Also here is good location to go to many cool places. I really recommend this place if you travel San Francisco :)

4365969,452223937,2019-05-12,81814678,Michelle,"The space is quite lovely and sparkling clean. In particular the back garden patio is carefully maintained and extends the studio apartments space. 

Leslie and Richard are very friendly super responsive and went out of their way to ensure that I had all the information I could possibly need to make the most of my time in San Francisco. They took their role as tour guides to a whole new level and helped me plan my limited time in the city.  Their home is a short walk to the local subway and extensive public transit system which made getting around the city quite easy.

Despite the small space it is bright and airy tastefully decorated and has many thoughtful touches. It is well appointed with a fridge toaster oven microwave and coffee maker. Leslie has a breakfast bar and other touches that make the space easy to live in."

10632584,327428777,2018-09-23,16926038,Jennifer,Jen’s house was the perfect getaway for my daughters birthday with a couple of her best friends. Every bed was comfortable and decked out with the softest blankets EVER! Many delightful designer details to appreciate. We explored the Bernal Heights neighborhood and found it to be one of the friendliest in SF. Who knew?
1069167,529324607,2019-09-14,36907633,Emma,Jenifer + Bob were amazing hosts. So kind and accommodating. Their place was loaded with charm and unique vintage finds and staying in this cozy room was just amazing. The bed was super comfy and I loved the neighborhood. The street parking is super easy and free which was a huge bonus. Would recommend 150%
14671675,113407551,2016-11-12,98540894,Manh,"I stayed at Pete and Ivan's place for 1 week. Below are pros and cons:
Pros:
- The room was clean and nice when I arrived near public transportation
- Pete was friendly invited me to hang out with them during my stay. I had some good conversations with him.

Cons:
- Hosts never answered my question about their place before my trip
- I arrived during the arrival window but hosts weren't at home without any notice. Luckily a guest opened the door for me. After got in I felt kinda lost (no info on the house keys etc.) but when I texted to ask where the keys were hosts were quick to let me know.
- The guest bathroom wasn't cleaned frequently I think. It was dirty occasionally probably due to other guests.

Overall the place felt like a hotel with shared bathrooms. Pete & Evan have a system (keys in a lock box clean towels in a shelf in the living etc.) but I think they need to make a little effort to make the experience a bit more of ""airbnb"" and less of a hotel that self-operates. 

An OK place for a quick stay but I wouldn't recommend for longer visit.
If you travel from abroad you need to ask for all info (direction to place how to get in etc.) in advance because you wouldn't want to show up at the place without a working phone and nobody opens the door for you."
11104122,366486854,2019-01-02,1867969,Andrea,"Dan’s house is simply Amazing.
The view is breathtaking!
The house was extremely clean and provided for everything.

Thank you Dan"
1333047,44254431,2015-08-24,41943053,Haris,I had a very pleasant and comfortable stay at Graham's residence. Although I wasn't able to meet Graham his two adorable cats provided awesome company. I drove from LA and needed a place to park Graham was kind enough to let me use his garage. He also provided very clear instructions on how to access the house and wifi since he wasn't around. The neighborhood is nice definitely a welcome change compared to the LA scenery. I also enjoyed Philz Coffee which is just a few blocks away. I stayed for a day and overall it was fantastic. 
7035672,305102216,2018-08-10,86782530,Brian,"Kyle’s place is perfect for anybody who wants to visit San Francisco. This place was honestly our best Airbnb experience. Kyle and Andrea was super accommodating especially with the check in and checkout. They have a great welcome guide that was definitely of use to us. This place was nice clean and welcoming. Kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pans. The closet had hangers and extra supplies including an iron and ironing board. Plenty of towels were provided for the whole week in the bathroom. The bed was super comfortable and spacious. And plus the tv could be pulled out to watch from the couch or bed. We especially loved the slow game of chess match we had with Bianca who is a really good chess player.
The location of the Airbnb was close enough to plenty grocery stores and good restaurants. About a 15-20 minute drive to the hustle and bustle of downtown and bay of San Francisco. We highly recommend this place for anyone who likes the nice and quiet side of San Francisco. "
5196399,123129798,2016-12-27,79180142,Bilma,Zain n Duncan n Simon were amazing hosts. The stay was very comfortable. The rooms bathroom n kitchen were neat n clean... The best part was.... In the 5 days I stayed there I met people from all over the world.... what more can I say!! A definite recommendation!! It is an experience in itself in San Francisco!!!

964751,136443374,2017-03-10,27600653,Shutian,We love the place. It's very cozy and convenient. The place is close to golden state bridge and the point lobos. Phil is very nice. Before we arrived he already provided us valuable information via email. We love the backyard and the lovely lemon tree.  I even had one conference call in the backyard during sunset time.

Getting around town was really easy from this location.  If we return to San Francisco there won’t be anywhere else I’ll consider staying.

18765944,304514508,2018-08-09,13045985,Cindy,small cozy space great to spend a nice weekend in San Francisco. It was  close to golden gate park and other turistic places had lots available parking spaces near the house. The host was nice respectful and responded to any questions quickly.
33578,1094249,2012-04-07,216422,Carlton,Staying with Kepa was in a word phenomenal.  She is extremely friendly hospitable and knowledgeable about both the neighborhood and San Francisco in general...our conversations and her suggestions led to a truly unique off-the-beaten path experience that could never be replicated by some hotel concierge!  The Garden Studio was clean bright spacious and very well appointed.  Also the pictures of her garden don't do her outdoor space (Website hidden by Airbnb) very much an inner city oasis and a wonderful place to relax.  I will without a doubt be staying with Kepa again in the future.  I feel that in a very brief period of time (I stayed with Kepa for about 24 hrs) I made a friend for life!
18209966,313633373,2018-08-25,47656341,Alyssa,Donna’s place was superb. The flat was spacious and had everything we could have needed. The balcony was nice for seeing the city. The welcome basket was such a thoughtful touch! Check-in was extremely simple and Donna was always quick to respond to our messages. 
1392204,535580514,2019-09-24,221073785,Gergely Péter,"Dee is very nice and very communicative host. She lives in the house the kitchen is common with her (and in some cases with other airbnb guests) but nothing else. Her home is very special with a great neighborhood.
However I can relate with one former opinion which said that the many historical value made us very conscious of staying there and because of the rules and notes about the things reminding you to be careful it was not the most relaxing experience. (Don't think any serious thing: you can't open the window can't roll your suitcase etc.) 
But this was only us if you're into historical homes and like to interact with your host this will be a great place to stay in SF!"
2592518,73902172,2016-05-11,60939541,Janice,Daniel was an excellent host and the apartment was just as described in his listing.  Lots of charm and all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay.  Daniel was also very responsive whenever we had any questions.

I loved the neighborhood: hilly with views a terrific family friendly canyon park to take walks in easy to use Bart and buses got me quickly all over the city and the local Canyon market is the best also good bookstore and restaurants. I definitely plan to return here on my next SF visit.
1203062,10391526,2014-02-17,327005,Talia,We had such a lovely time at Lu's house.  My five-year-old daughter and I stayed there and my cousin and her five-year-old son surprised us and stayed for a night too.  The apartment was perfect -- the kids loved the bunk bed and toys and books and we loved the deck and overall great space and location.  I'd recommend Lu's to anyone!
15717561,203846047,2017-10-15,37497116,Michele,Apartment is well located and was as described. Carl was responsive and helpful. I recommend and would definitely stay again if back in SF.
21555212,566567207,2019-11-19,106749671,Alyssa,"Comfy beds relaxing atmosphere and lots of character !

Like all hostels make sure you bring an eye mask and ear plugs if you forget earplugs the do have them available. I had 0 issues with noise once I put my plugs in. 

The sheets were clean the towels were clean the rooms were clean and once the building finishes its painting it will be super clean on the outside too. 

I didn’t have a single issue finding an open bathroom and the bottom bunks have curtains which is awesome. Climbing to the top bunk isn’t the best thing in the world but the pillows and bed were SUPER comfy. Like. I wanted to take the whole thing with me. 

Tip for travelers or first time hostel goers - 

Since you’re staying in a shared space clean up after yourself. They do have someone who comes by and cleans but this isn’t a hotel. So remember that dirty towel you leave in the bathroom or that soap wrapper its gonna be there untill the cleaning lady comes by. 

Also don’t spent an excessive time in the bathroom. Best thing to do is to interact with other guests it’ll make your time there much more enjoyable."
30264063,423655055,2019-03-14,46688684,Brianna,Great mix of Airbnb and hotel. Wonderful little continental breakfast and good location. The room is small but has everything you need.

Both the house and the room are very nicely decorated. Room has TV with Netflix on it. Also the neighbourhood is safe clean and quiet and not far from the centre. Would stay again!
840986,23650757,2014-12-07,9140419,Lurvies,We love this apartment! Photo doesn't do justice to how cosy this place is. It's huge for us (2 person) This place has a really nice neighborhood and convenient stores are nearby. What I love most is its FULLY equipped kitchen which allows us to cook our meals (including salt pepper oil spices). Didn't get to see Addy and Carlota during the stay but we know they are just a text away. This place has everything you need at home (essentials). We loved it. Stay here you won't be disappointed!

533627,243349117,2018-03-15,167942283,Rich,This is a beautiful home that is tastefully decorated.  The updated interior has stunning wood & tile floors.  The kitchen has updated appliances and flows into an attractive living room with great views.  All three bedrooms are spacious and the two on the top floor have breathtaking views of the city skyline.  Whole Foods is a short & exhilarating walk about four blocks away as well as several restaurants.  Fran is a great host and responded immediately to questions.  When staying in S/F this is the place to call home.

Só recomendaria colocar luz na parte da cozinha pois a noite fica escuro para fazer um lanche."

334339,28879466,2015-03-31,6203341,Fiona,I was greeted with a glass of wine by Bruce who was helpful with local information. The house is very clean and I liked the neighbourhood BUT I think it is important to note that the bedroom is located in the centre of the house and right next to the open kitchen. Bruce warned me ahead of time that he was an early riser. However I didn't expect to be woken at 5.30am most mornings with what seemed like an endless chorus of pot banging and other extremely loud noises such as insinkerator blenders etc. Just when you think the noise is over and you may be able to grab an extra hour's sleep Roxy the dog would start barking at passers-by. I've stayed at airbnb homes across the world and this is the first time I have not been totally happy with my stay.

2046634,38343872,2015-07-14,28872462,Nicole,Kenix was a great host! We only stayed one night during our trip but the apartment was everything we needed. Kenix rents out the rooms in the apartment above hers and has a pretty great set up a common living and kitchen area with 3 separate rooms and 2 bathrooms. Everything was clean and comfortable and way cheaper than a hotel! It is not in the heart of the city but everything is fairly easy to get to. Would definitely recommend for anyone who needs a place to stay while exploring the city!
808919,44950350,2015-08-30,10185217,Emma,Great room in Susan's house! Loved the location of the house we had parking right outside and the bus into town is really easy! I would definitely stay here again when we are next in San Francisco.

I strongly recommend this place if you want to stay in San Francisco. Location is in the middle of all the attraction points. Equal distance to the downtown beach hills and the airport. The house is very cozy quite clean and comfortable. We are fan of it.

Participating in San Francisco full marathon made me come to stay his room he gave many tips for that even though I was international people. And in his house friendly dog was waiting for me. I have a little experiences having a dog but I was relaxed with him.
Thank you for everything."
24129914,430480036,2019-03-30,5820075,Nick,Leslie’s place was fantastic.  We loved having the separate entrance and own space to cook and relax.  For future travelers this place could be difficult for kids given the steep staircase and we had trouble with the WiFi throughout our stay.  That said overall we had a great stay and would recommend to friends.

21220773,294153614,2018-07-21,18233244,Christopher,This is a wonderful old firehouse! The host very kindly allowed us to take photos slide down the firepole and climb up to the roof / tower. It is a beautiful building with tall ceilings and a wonderful history. We enjoyed our stay. :)
8739,427474289,2019-03-23,22383618,Vicki,"Great location and Ivan and Wendy are lovely hosts! 
Room is right near the common area so not the most private/quiet but great if you’re looking for a place to crash right in the Mission. Highly recommend!
Bathroom is also lovely."
19328446,543865149,2019-10-08,167735981,Katharine,Excellent communication and easy check-in. Very nice room and attached bath very clean as well. Easy in and out with the keypad at the door. Great location in a very nice quiet neighborhood but only steps from numerous shops restaurants and public transportation. Susan is a great host ready to answer any questions or with tips for local events and restaurants. Highly recommend.
20762414,306575515,2018-08-12,13107279,Wendy,Great apartment with plenty of space for 5 adults and lots of thoughtful touches. Parking on the drive was a real bonus and Uber rides into town were a great way to see more of the city and get downtown quicky.
19015884,261576810,2018-05-06,148478747,Karen,This place is EXACTLY what we had hoped for while visiting San Fran... immaculate spacious and great location. Jennifer was very hospitable and responsive to our questions. Would love to return some day!
15215678,242343987,2018-03-11,107108474,Genevieve,Jennifer and Steve were very responsive and helpful. The neighborhood was very quiet and nice. The apartment was really hot inside and it was difficult to sleep without the window being open. Unfortunately the window didn’t have a screen and was deck level and people could see inside the room when going up or down the stairs. The shower was a little tricky to work as well but we finally figured it out after some messing around with it. There were also a lot of personal items which we didn’t really mind but some people may be uncomfortable with. Overall a good stay.
2683409,21252389,2014-10-13,4099545,Katrina,"Good neighbourhood quiet area. Vaughn is a friendly host and his dog is a sweetheart.
 A note those not familiar with San Francisco: it can be a bit of a mission getting to the downtown core by public transit at times from this area so consider renting a car or better yet bikes!"
11911651,246106545,2018-03-24,170472565,JungHun,Clean and comfortable!
72444,31523966,2015-05-06,23003836,Jim,Clean friendly and great location. Good sized storage locker for each bed. Just what I was looking for.
3792754,60262453,2016-01-21,8647617,Pablo,The apartment is in a quiet location near the beautiful Golden Gate Park. Post pictures are as it is the apartment  very cute and comfortable for a family . Very good beds and Angie very helpful. I recommend it.
17369805,300686145,2018-08-02,6666717,Tom,Great place Roberto is on hand to help. Highly recommended.
1995487,203802646,2017-10-15,15500609,Alaina,I’ve stayed in numerous AirBnbs around the world and Michael’s home is without a doubt one of the best—a hidden gem in The Mission. The loft is inviting airy cozy stunning (Website hidden by Airbnb) sister and I each had our own space as well as a fireplace a terrace AND places to read. Amenities were great and there was nothing we lacked. And to boot Michael is an awesome person and interesting to chat with. Here’s hoping we return next year!
5222044,47243673,2015-09-17,19951,Maryanne,Suzanne and Jim greeted us warmly and are absolutely the nicest people. They went out of their way to make sure our stay was a great experience giving lots of helpful tips and recommendations. The kitchen was stocked with more than we expected. The description was accurate in fact nicer than the pictures. It's a great neighborhood and the perfect base to explore the real San Francisco and all it has to offer. 
28360154,415484345,2019-02-22,1176120,Julia,This apartment exceeded all my expectations! Stylish decor and furniture freshly renovated sparkling clean lots of awesome touches like fresh flowers and a selection of teas ample towels pillows etc; but the absolute highlight was the deck with gorgeous views of the city! No better way to start the day than sipping on coffee in the sun overlooking San Francisco! The communication was fast & accommodating I’m very thankful that my last minute reservation was accepted! I’m surely coming back!
36945601,539094610,2019-09-30,275585911,Noah,11/10! Everything was better than I had imagined! Colleen was great and went the extra mile as a host - offering up great conversations coffee some food great local recommendations and even an offer to do my laundry - to ensure that my stay was everything I needed and then some. My best AirBnB experience thus far.
19872447,400050702,2019-01-10,14361645,Roger,Clean comfortable efficient.  Jeff communicates well and quickly. Good value!
24471037,350916652,2018-11-20,119256670,Laura,Everything was really great I will come back if I travel to San Francisco again. I recommend this place!
20837529,206729086,2017-10-26,44439240,Victoria,Jean was a wonderful and informative host. She was also very easy to communicate with. The space looked like the pictures and was clean and comfortable. Will deff be back! Highly recommended! Thanks again!
18804992,300267061,2018-08-01,46302448,Walter,Highly recommend! Very good location and quiet neighborhood.
166771,32577697,2015-05-19,5237128,Christopher,Had a great stay at Patti's place. Very clean. Bed was comfortable. Great proximity to transit stops. Provided instructions for operating the heaters cable etc. which saved time. No complaints at all. Definitely would stay there again. 
8886022,70865937,2016-04-21,26302998,Emma,Matts apartment is in a great location it's close to a lot of great bars and restaurants and Dolores Park. The bedroom is on the street so it can get loud at night with cars and sirens but it felt very safe. There was some confusion when we got there about parking and it was a little difficult to get in touch at first but once we reached Matt he was very helpful and the parking spot is so key if you drive. There is also a great balcony and huge kitchen!
12725886,350258122,2018-11-18,3586096,Philippe,An incredible room inside a large urban house. Debbie was a great host - Will definitely going back to this place.
1323983,110343363,2016-10-25,15708611,Pema,See previous review (from a few days before)
24063893,334674108,2018-10-09,77188852,Eva,If you want to be in the SF action this is a great location. As Charmaine mentions and other reviews as well it is city-loud. It's not so much the restaurant downstairs but the trash trucks that come pick up oh around 3:30am. If you're okay with that and expect this ahead of time you'll still enjoy this apartment. You're in walking distance to shops other restaurants a bookstore and easy drive to SF tourist spots. Charmaine had great communication good directions to access the apartment. Looks like the photos-modern finishes simple yet well decorated. The one not-so-good thing was that we found clear evidence throughout the apartment that it had not been cleaned properly prior to our arrival. Maybe this was an oversight because other recent reviews don't mention this. I let her know the details of the things we saw/noticed so hopefully that will get addressed. Overall it was a good place to stay!
1030352,231781408,2018-02-02,53098159,Jenny,Great stay I booked on behalf of someone else and communication was excellent they went above and beyond to make sure I had all the relevant information needed and it was a very easy process. Thank you!
1506702,66200828,2016-03-20,38464542,Brian,Super clean and just as advertised. 
27253510,468151660,2019-06-11,255606881,Michael,My children and I stayed here for 3 nights in June... We absolutely loved Johnathan and Sally’s place! It exceeded our expectations. Extremely clean cutely decorated comfortable beds accessible parking and snacks provided! It felt like home. The hosts were quick and friendly! I would defiantly recommend this place for a stay! :)
34868915,491121583,2019-07-19,35723576,Mariah,Wow what a location! Valentino was an incredible host providing all sorts of great recommendations and even allowed us to keep our luggage at his place while we explored before going to the airport. Would certainly recommend his place to anyone going to San Fran!
7247351,68741355,2016-04-06,7447601,Tracy,Great and easy quick overnight stay after late night flight and early morning departure. The place had exactly what we needed- clean place and comfy bed. Cute perks- keurig granola bars and clementine snacks. Easy to communicate and coordinate. 
8309401,47469895,2015-09-19,37299295,Cheryl,Great place! Very comfortable only there wasn't any parking lost nights and there was street sweeping for two of the three. But the plus is you can't sleep in since you'll have to move your car so it forces you to make sure you go out and do things! Loved the old fashioned bathroom and tub (can't use it) but very newly renovated shower. Karen had also provides some amenities like shower gel bar soap (dove) shampoo and conditioner. It was also on the second level but was relative easy to access. The WiFi had some problems reaching where we were stsying even though there were three routers going. Eventually figured it out on our last day haha. Great place and would stay again. 
9118962,328955940,2018-09-27,38496976,Danielle,Brian's house was really nice super clen and welcoming. We had a great 3 night stay and felt at home. Would love to come back again!
1620411,236266095,2018-02-18,8549282,Holly,"The cozy studio actually feels bigger than what you might expect from the photos. It's clean and very comfortable. Having a full kitchen is always a must for us and this little one worked out perfectly for making a yummy Valentine's Day dinner. 

The location was really perfect for my husband and I as we had commitments on the peninsula but wanted to be close to public transportation to get out to Berkeley and Oakland. There are plenty of great places to eat and get coffee in the neighborhood without it being too much of a scene. The hosts were friendly and quick to respond to our questions. They were available should we need anything and they kept to themselves. 

Overall we will definitely be looking to stay here again on our next trip to SF."
59344,56970190,2015-12-20,27392763,Betsy,John is a great host. He has excellent communication skills and is very personable. The apartment is very quiet and quaint. Street parking was easy and the apartment is walking distance to a number of restaurants. Thanks for a lovely weekend!
32577104,428749085,2019-03-25,165482347,Chenyu,The hotel is located just one block away from union square. Super convenient location and facilities!
27316091,485922214,2019-07-11,565206,Matt,Friendly host and apartment in a classic neighborhood. Quiet clean and stylish with a comfortable bed. I was the only person there.
32329385,525378718,2019-09-07,203099631,庚彤,It's very good rooms and complete kichen equipments inside. Near subway easy to go everywhere. We cooked by ourselve every day. This is a very nice apartment to traveller no matter for business or vocation.
16255081,263352338,2018-05-11,173066728,Gary,Great location right around the corner from China Town and very near the high end shops walking distance to Moscone Center.  Pretty old building and does not have the amenities you would find at the more mainline hotels.  Elevator is old school with the double (inside cage and outside glass) sliding doors that you have to open yourself.  Kinda quaint unless you are trying to do it while wresting with your luggage.  Watch your step when exiting because it doesn't always stop even with the hallway floor.  I didn't interact much with the reception/security folks but what little I did they were friendly and helpful.  Room 424 was clean however the floor slanted so when you get into bed or try to sit up against the wall the bed would roll across the laminate floor and leave a gap between the head of the bed and the wall.  Shower is a claw foot tub with two shower curtains around it on a pipe.  Probably not bad if you are a thin person however the curtain kept sticking to my body when I was taking a shower because it was so closed in.  Room was half the price of the rooms at the mainstream hotels not sure it was half the value but pretty close.  Doubt I would stay here again if I am back in SF but all in all not a bad place just not really for me.
34155649,547725009,2019-10-15,38581918,Natalia,Really confortable bed 20min to the center with Bart transport from daly city 8min walking from the House. Lisa and her husband were really nice she answers to all of your questions really fast. The place was really clean. Thanks for everything!
13157125,95963681,2016-08-21,11474336,Manon Et David,The room is perfect the bathroom very pleasant and the bed confortable. David is a perfect host we recommand him.
24463,4084121,2013-04-08,24485,Marius,Charming host charming space charming location. Great experience. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the beautiful city of San Francisco!  
24427167,266915472,2018-05-20,2616965,Ethan,Everything was just perfect. Hector and Pierre were two nicest people I've met through Airbnb. The house was extremely clean and nice and I felt like it was in hotel-quality. We rented a car so location didn't really matter; however there was a gunshot/crime scene around the neighborhood so I'm not sure if it's in a safe neighborhood
6120540,160598638,2017-06-14,82571868,Cordelia,Another fantastic stay at Philip's place. Enjoyed seeing Pam Philip and Rupert (the dog) again! Thank you for everything as always! :) 
23522934,511737501,2019-08-17,12608275,Roussel,"Perfect spot to discover san Francisco 
Excellent location great communication 
Would highly recommend"
32703560,523507922,2019-09-03,695962,Sarah,This was a decent place to stay and in a very convenient location.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable. There was a hotel fee charged when we checked in.  Upon noting to the facility through Airbnb that this was not advertised it was refunded.
2770268,202996912,2017-10-13,17086318,Shuichi,raman's open home feel made it a very comfortable stay. got to know a fellow tenant in my down time from work. was visiting sf for a last minute trip and i was lucky to find raman's home.
19228248,530363266,2019-09-15,45552000,Tony,A wonderfully beautiful place - exactly like the pictures!! It's also very clean and conveniently located in a family friendly neighbourhood. Justin is also super responsive and helpful. Our family will stay here again the next time we're in SF.
4104344,228045543,2018-01-17,8727945,Barbara Aiko,We can only recommend David's place: amazing location beautiful and clean house very cool and helpful hosts and a lovely dog.  We really enjoyed staying there and chatting with David and his partner  they are just great guys!
4321720,25558202,2015-01-19,11129780,Tina,"Michael Novita and Max are the ideal hosts in San Francisco! The apt is FABULOUS and in a great location! I highly recommend staying with them! They're warm friendly and very accommodating! Their apt is lovely and extremely convenient in the heart of the city. Three cheers to Max their sweet natured cockapoo is a wonderful addition to the room and SO worth staying with them - he's an attraction himself!

Many thanks Michael Novita and Max! "
1984709,76227841,2016-05-25,26486326,Steve,We come to San Francisco a couple of times a year to visit our daughter and this was with out a doubt the nicest the most comfortable and the most convenient place we have ever stayed! Robby is a wonderful host and he has done an outstanding and meticulous job remodeling and decorating this luxurious suite!
35126491,464896154,2019-06-06,219412662,Jane,Great location and great host. Comfortable and the balcony is a bonus
9298491,74512314,2016-05-15,60297339,Jennifer,My family stayed here for a weekend and Lawrence was very friendly and very accommodating. The house was nice clean and fit my family of 6 very comfortably. I was also great to have your own parking space in the garage as trying to park in SF is rather difficult. Lawrence also provides snacks at a fee and little touches like towels and shampoo that make it easy and convenient. We had a little problem with the garage door not working but Lawrence came quickly (within 10 min) to fix it. Also there was only one bathroom mirror so if you have alot of people(girls) staying with you bring your own mirror ;) 
8328410,76138181,2016-05-25,3634281,Stacy-Marie,Great space in a very convenient location. Excellent communication before and throughout the stay. Definitely recommend for biz travellers. 
7499793,140090291,2017-03-27,40514574,Shannon,Daniel's place was so great! He was very nice and accommodating and even gave us periodic bernal heights tips. Super cozy and definitely felt like a home away from home. 
713877,84715972,2016-07-08,10108679,George,"Excellent accommodation in a great location. Perfect base for exploring SF. 

No direct communication from host on arrival or during stay but that was ok for us and there was plenty of information and helpful advice in the notes Stacey left. 

A very smooth and enjoyable Airbnb experience :)"
9435665,234143254,2018-02-11,20062786,Angela,Maria's place is in a wonderful part of San Francisco! There's plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby it's very walkable quiet and I never felt unsafe. Plus the room itself lets in a lot of sunlight which is really pleasant. I do wish the desk had been more usable (the chair is far too tall for the desk so your knees end up knocking against it rather than going under it) but otherwise this was a beautiful place! I would definitely stay again!
13815533,194072708,2017-09-15,137954581,Lucia,This is a lovely place to stay - it was clean attractive and had an exceptionally comfortable bed and wonderful shower! We cooked a meal or two of fresh foods from the local market that Doug pointed us to and the hot tub is very easy to use. The beach is just a few blocks away and public transport is easy to get to. The neighborhood is fun to walk around; we found that people are very friendly and love to chat. We had a car and went into SF every day and never had a problem parking on streets but it was the middle of September and during weekdays.We highly recommend spending a half day at least  in Golden Gate Park - rent a rowboat and bring a bohemian picnic. I would definitely return to stay here again. And if you are adventurous rent the little yellow Go Cars..they are a blast!
8275596,449475475,2019-05-06,26998518,Heather,Rebecca's place is nestled in a safe just far enough from the hustle and bustle neighborhood. The space is easily accessible clean and equipped with great amenities. I would highly recommend this space and would definitely stay here again.
24489443,473516549,2019-06-21,10808253,Chris,Had the pleasure of staying with ko for a short business trip. Responses were instant room was clean and delightful. Ko and Sasha (i think?) also had great suggestions for a place to grab lunch and work. Overall it was perfect and the stay was just too short!
21645603,264750462,2018-05-14,15110682,Isaiah,Great location. Great space fro a group. Great value too. Super close to BART and near Dolores Castro Mission etc. Highly recommended no complaints.
7067681,82620520,2016-06-28,30560815,Ash,The perfect place for the perfect stay. If you want to experience San Francisco and all of the people read no further and book the place! Amazing staff friendly environment and it is an experience to see to believe. 
8328410,98598096,2016-08-31,46797901,Renee,Ruben communicate well. Was disappointed with lake of towels coffee maker and hair dryer. Can improve with simple  amenities like toilet paper and paper towels trash can.
137546,53459433,2015-11-09,24749932,Tim,Scott was a very gracious host. He interacted with us like we were longtime friends. Scott gave suggestions for local restaurants as well as other San Fran tips. Super nice guy. The room was clean and nice. The neighborhood is definitely not upscale but the choice in local ethnic restaurants made up for it. Very good Air B n B experience. 
37494196,526979032,2019-09-09,30750277,Renee,"Great location! To be able to walk to the end of the street and watch the sunset was a bonus I did not expect. Neighborhood was quiet but proved to be a great hub for our visit.

Anne is lovely! She noticed we were low on coffee and made a special effort to replenish it with a local favorite brand. She was readily available and gave us several tips on restaurants that turned out to be excellent. Check in was effortless and having a garage space was a big help - especially when it rained. 

Her place was neat and tidy and had everything we needed to be comfortable. You don't really realize how much the details matter - for example separate lamps on the nightstands let one of us read while the other went to sleep. It is a small thing but one that exemplifies how thoughtfully Anne set up the space for visitors.

We were very pleased and would highly recommend Anne's place. 

Anne - thanks again for everything!!"
13585679,294232926,2018-07-21,114059805,Kelly,Beautiful space beautiful neighborhood great host great time!
3506164,23214968,2014-11-25,11311675,Sidney,What a lovely garden studio in a great location!!  This could not have been nicer in any way and the view to the garden was stunning.  This is located in Noe Valley a fun vibrant neighbor.  We had a wonderful time.
20361588,190728286,2017-09-04,8656944,Rona,Elyssa was a fantastic host. She was on point with communication - always quick to respond and answer any questions. We booked Very last minute and she was super accommodating and made sure we were able to have a place to stay. She has a very thorough manual which I failed to read at first but she patiently answered all my questions. Her place is comfortable clean and well stocked. She left snacks and wine as a welcome and her kitchen had everything needed. Amid the record heat her place had a fan which is uncommon in the bay area so we were comfortable despite the heat. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others.
2948159,16912025,2014-08-04,17472675,Edgar,Great apartment for a visit to San Francisco. Beautiful and elegant. Convenient to grocery pharmacy restaurants. Easy to get to the more-frequently touristed parts of the city especially Castro and the Mission. Stefan was helpful and friendly.  
16572187,400052614,2019-01-10,7412286,Jane,Really great place! Lots of privacy and the apartment is really clean. The bed was really comfortable and warm. The bathroom was super modern. As per pictures! Will definitely return when I’m in SF :)
24099463,316188404,2018-08-30,7840342,Erin,Had a great stay at Brian's! I was traveling for a work conference and this was a quiet and relaxing place to stay after some long days. It was an easy commute to the peninsula and there was plenty of parking even when I returned late in the evening. The place was very clean and comfortable and it was easy to communicate with Brian. Definitely plan on coming back for conference travel in the future!
4439461,195777685,2017-09-20,35251729,Will,Place was in a great location & very nice... Great bathroom... Host was very helpful & friendly...

Can’t recommend the whole experience highly enough!"

3506164,499007114,2019-07-30,121926797,Donna,My best air b n b experience. Clean parking was on the street in front of the place easy to go anywhere in SF. Great coffee and breakfast places within walking distance. I slept 9 hrs in the king size bed. Quiet. Great yard if you want to sit outside. Reasonably priced. Rent this place.
9110032,113405390,2016-11-12,39853827,Katie,Brian made it easy to check in and has very helpful signage throughout the property in case you have any questions.  The apartment is spotless and we felt very comfortable using the shared spaces.  You can't beat the location- a short walk to the beach grocery store park and other restaurants/cafes.  If you're looking for a quality location for a good price I'd recommend Brian's home! 
8082364,306562524,2018-08-12,127189057,Vibhor,Stayed here for 9 weeks great stay great location seamless check in and check out. No complaints whatsoever! Kitchen is very stocked and in-unit washer/dryer is really convenient. 
1995487,95150689,2016-08-18,22223128,Tessa,We were looking for an overnight stay in San Francisco and were looking at hotels. I am so glad we found this place because it far exceeded our expectations and was a much better experience than a hotel would have been. The Mission Loft is in an excellent location close to shops restaurants and Mission Delores park. The place it's self was clean modern functional and comfortable.

114401,303093408,2018-08-06,30104024,Myung-Hoon,"카스트로 역과 가깝고 F스트리트 카를 이용하기에 좋은 곳입니다. 호스트 George도 매우 친절해서 답변도 빠르고 편안했습니다. 숙소는 혼자 쓰시기에는 전혀 불편함이 없고 같은 집에 다른 사람이 살지만 전혀 얼굴 안 보았습니다. 누가 있다는 정도?
밖에 길이 보이는 창가 방이고 주방 옆 테라스에서 보이는 뷰도 훌륭합니다. 컵라면 먹으면서 뷰 보니 좋더라구요. 숙소가 카스트로 지역이라 여자 혼자 샌프란시스코 오시기에는 약간 무서울 수도 있지만 거리 자체는 조용합니다."

3175769,25453120,2015-01-16,25862699,Susan,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I am officially a convert. Jeff's beautiful 3 bedroom condo in Cow Hollow was so much nicer than the available hotel alternatives: great location tons of light and a well-stocked kitchen for cooking (if we'd only had time!). Jeff met us when we arrived walked us through the apartment and left an incredibly detailed ""what you should know"" memo covering every possible contingency. I highly recommend both the condo and the host. "
31494299,450977920,2019-05-10,218939393,Connor,"A great spot in the centre of San Francisco and a good walk or short Lyft away from everything you could want to see.

The room is a good size and the loft is a quirky little nook! Great for a group of three such as ourselves."

3319447,411817766,2019-02-13,110783333,Jasmine,Anna’s place was great! If you’re a foodie you’ll be spoilt for choices on Irving st!! One of the best Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants in SF is also located on Irving! Walking distance only so it was nice evening walking to and from the restaurants! The room is very warm and cosy it has everything you’ll need and more! We were starving and freezing when we got to SF the tea and small snacks made all the difference when we arrived! Anna is quick to respond to any queries and concerns also. There’s a few good books available in the room for some light reading on a lazy day looking out into the little garden. Public transport was super convenient also from Anna’s! There’s also a really nice park across from Anna’s which we really enjoyed also! We had some lazy days just chilling in the area and at Anna’s and it felt just like home! Thanks for everything Anna!

468751,263350312,2018-05-11,89993682,Jacques,Chambre principale bruyante des 6 h le matin seconde chambre principalement destinée à des enfants Pour la période d'utilisation (début mai) il est nécessaire de booster le chauffage. Pour la vie courante cuisine salon salle à manger et jardin sont agréables et suffisamment grands pour 3/4 personnes. Au surplus la situation est parfaite pour de nombreuses destinations à pied ou transports en commun et le mémo fourni par Terrance est explicite et utile
516836,2787415,2012-11-02,616545,Morten,"This is one of my most favourite places to stay in San Francisco. The view is stunning and I really enjoyed standing on the balcony and looking at the nightly skyline. 

Fran's house is modern new clean tasteful and was great to come home to. I enjoyed this quiet getaway from the stress in the city and the walk up the hill which is rewarded with this spectacular view. 

Restaurants can be found in the neighbourhood in quantity and quality and Fran has great recommendations.

I recommend staying here."

3506164,17649279,2014-08-15,14995626,Lauren,Nice and quiet very clean and new. Noe Valley is a charming neighborhood and The Mission is very near and more eclectic.
34756884,538493752,2019-09-29,52825387,Jonathan,Great location not far from Golden Gate state park. Clean comfortable accommodations.
567239,126418990,2017-01-11,92413754,John,Judy and Ed are very welcoming and accomodating. Theirs is a compact homely place with a resident cat and with a fine view over SF. Although it is not in central SF it is easy to get around using public transport and there are some places (such as Twin Peaks) which are very walkable.

1725853,27829689,2015-03-13,25582724,David,"Das Apartment von Lina und Alex ist super. Es ist sehr modern und luxuriös eingerichtet. Bei der Ankunft war alles vorbereitet und man hat sich gleich willkommen gefühlt. Das Apartment ist auf bis zu 4 Personen ausgelegt das fanden wir allerdings auf Dauer etwas eng. Wir würden es eher für ein Pärchen oder eine kleine Familie empfehlen.  Die Lage ist wenn man mit einem Auto unterwegs ist super es sind einige Sehenswürdigkeiten in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen.  Ansonsten gibt es aber auch fußläufig einige Busse und Bahnen.
Insgesamt hatten wir einen tollen Aufenthalt und würden das Apartment wieder buchen. 
"
17576074,223746430,2018-01-01,130814608,Jesse,Igor’s place was very clean and nice. Communication was on point and responded quickly. He was there at check in to show where extra supplies (towelsblanketsetc) were kept but pretty much hands off after that. Little snacks were left out for guest too. Would definitely stay there again!
7549488,222047348,2017-12-28,139363470,Ron,Very inviting home with easy access to city. Would stay again.
1489175,192018766,2017-09-09,117831818,Andrew,Patricia's house is beautiful and exactly as advertised. We were very comfortable. Patricia's communication was great. She checked in on us often and that was appreciated. Her home made us all feel like we were home. This is especially important to us as this was my Mother's 70th birthday week I grew up in SF and we had family fly in from the UK. We had a great time being tourists and it was just fantastic coming home each evening to a quiet neighborhood and the ability to park two cars!
32267786,437484714,2019-04-14,40245617,Nancy,Good communication accommodating personable. Thank you!

4093967,124402551,2017-01-01,4148266,Roderick,Jeannie and Skate are kind good and fun folks who look after their guests beautifully.  Their place is inspiring cozy functional and all around gorgeous.  The views are incredible and there are so many sweet spots in the garden to sit meditate read have conversations and to just enjoy the space.  It's truly a special place and Skate and Jeannie went above and beyond our expectations to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  Can't recommend their home enough :~)

7009654,475118264,2019-06-23,149506248,Silvia,"Glenn and his family are the perfect hosts. They perfectly fit in Airbnb mood: you’re not just a host but you somehow become part of the family. They’re kind friendly and ready to give you tips about San Francisco! 
I would totally recommend this place to everyone. 
Moreover the neighborhood is beautiful and quite yet you’ll find everything you need nearby (grocery’s restaurants public transports etc.)"
14426130,292336075,2018-07-17,112008025,Jayson,David's place was clean and great for our stay. I'd recommend to anyone heading to SF to stay at his place if you're looking for a mellow spot near the beach and metro access to the city.
1344752,132915515,2017-02-19,104161059,Kate,Wonderful home base for 3 couples from 3 cities attending a family wedding.  Comfortable space for us to gather and visit while we planned our city excursions and prepared for the wedding events.  All the amenities we could have asked for!  
29221865,475778223,2019-06-24,127480492,Jake,Joey's place was great for the quick stop in San Francisco! Exactly what we needed. Clean place and lots of parking.

2771128,120336843,2016-12-09,29332557,Whit,"Beautiful spot in the popular Noe Valley neighborhood
 of San Francisco."
28053384,324796257,2018-09-17,116612542,Melissa,Thomas and Lauren were fantastic hosts and were very flexible with check in time.  The space was exactly as pictured. I’d definitely stay again.
4902855,244448799,2018-03-18,26868678,Alexandria,"Tony was super responsive and made check-in/check-out really easy! The entire building was very clean and you can tell was recently remodeled. The bedrooms were also clean and let in a lot of natural light. It does have a dorm-style kind of vibe but it was well worth the price. 

Be forewarned you can hear your neighbors pretty easily but there’s a fan in the room you can turn on to drown out the noise. 

Overall I’d highly recommend this spot as a nice clean place to stay on a budget!"
24474830,318896508,2018-09-04,200206965,Joshua,Spectacular. perfect place to enjoy San Fran excellent people and cool location perfect for students and any other travellers
16858141,467716019,2019-06-10,99424372,Qiwen,Venessa was very helpful and respond quickly. The only issue is the SF is getting hot and there is no openable window in the room. Hopefully the future guests would under stand how hot this room would be. The cooling fan did little help.
2420887,418680960,2019-03-02,853269,Greg,Peter's apartment is very comfortable with lots of space for two people.  We enjoyed the natural light and views from the large windows that make it feel like you're living in a treehouse.  Several public transportation lines are within walking distance making it convenient to all parts of the city.  This is a special find for San Francisco!
10517693,76091026,2016-05-24,38813337,Seungseon,Highly recommended studio. I had a great trip for 5 days. His house is very cozy and well organized.  Location is good to access to Castro and Mission and very secure so if you are a woman and have a plan for a trip to SF alone it is good for you.

Not only were we greeted with a friendly demeanor but the gentleman was so helpful in maximizing our trip with suggestions to do on our stay. He helped us with local spots to eat drink and activities to do. He made it so convenient that we could purchase our tickets right from him. He was so helpful! The location was amazing everything was so close! 
1421774,491130538,2019-07-19,241365373,James,Vanick’s place is quiet and comfortable with quick easy access to the cable cars.  Accommodations were exactly as pictured and described.   We would highly recommend this vacation rental.  Vanick is a superb host!

The house is a Victorian but has very modern and stylish accommodation and lots of thoughtful touches. Aditi's helpfulness and attentiveness was greatly appreciated.
10943827,190709615,2017-09-04,16539674,Debra,What a fantastic jumping off spot for our family's SF vacation. Parking was abundant and we were able to get out and about quite easily. The neighborhood is fantastic-we felt like locals...and the unit itself is beautifully appointed clean and surprisingly spacious and flexible for our family of four. Michaele was a perfect host. Highly recommended!
33271309,567143536,2019-11-21,2772709,Tessa,Great experience. Beautifully decorated.
24736036,288798288,2018-07-10,18934919,Vicki And Jim,The place was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. At night we were able to leave the window open and had a nice breeze coming through and woke up to a clear view of the ocean in the distance. Marcia was quick to answer my questions very accommodating with check-in and had a spacious clean bathroom for us to use with all the commodities of being at home. My only concern would be that you do have to climb two flights of stairs and if you have luggage that could be a problem for some people although it was no problem for us. The place was exactly as described and the hostess added some extra touches including instant coffee and some snacks. There is a small refrigerator and microwave in the room which is very handy. I hope to stay here on my next trip back to San Francisco.
7663003,121156176,2016-12-14,96345495,Ashley,Great place to stay for a few nights! Very clean and I slept like a rock. Close enough to walk to major spots downtown. Would recommend!

377569,23100872,2014-11-23,17748453,Danny,Alessandra's place was a great find! It's located right in the happening part of the Mission and about a 10 min walk to the subway to get anywhere else in the city. The loft space is comfy and gives you some extra space in the room. Alessandra is very warm and welcoming and a fantastic artist as well!
4135201,325793175,2018-09-20,46551922,Gary,This is a very comfortable space.  The room was clean and separate from the main living space to which I also had access.  Good interactions with my hosts added to the experience.  Best of all is the location - easy access to Twin Peaks (if you like to hike in the city) the Castro Cole valley neighbor and Golden Gate Park offered a nice cross-section of San Francisco.
8438267,534615298,2019-09-22,41595458,Alison,You will love the large bedrooms and the views. A lovely friendly neighbourhood

23599466,541123697,2019-10-04,99761605,Ben,For a real city experience this is the location. Everything is walking distance and it has the SF vibe. Enjoyed the stay very much the room is great much like a studio hotel room and the shower is invigorating.

6481492,367854752,2019-01-05,46505095,Gustavo,The house is located in a calm neighborhood and its is well connected with different parts of the city through public transport. The arrival was easy and Sasha was accesible through text at all times which made communication easy. The house has a nice living room/kitchen area that was perfect for our family since we are a group of six. Both bathrooms were fully equipped for all of us and the rooms were comfortable. Unfortunately we felt like we were intruding in their home for a week since everything was still in place and not in the cleanest codnition there was very little space for us to unpack store groceries in cabinet nor fridge and fully settle down.
17430696,241585028,2018-03-09,14646054,Sophie,We enjoyed our stay very much.
17794868,197516409,2017-09-25,103593640,Kevin,"The day of my arrival I was informed by the Herbert that my reservation was being moved to the sister ""bunkhouse"" property located nearby and was upgraded to a room with a private bathroom.  Fortunately I received a higher end room with a standard bed and not a room with bunk beds.. The room was nice and comfortable and the price was right.  The room faced a rear alley and did not have a view but also was quiet and did not have any street noise.  I would definitely stay again with or without a room with a view."
256148,112594949,2016-11-06,12059071,Mike,My husband and I spent a weekend here and thought it was fantastic.  Chris wasn't in town but she kept in contact and was very friendly.  The room and private bath were very clean and exactly as described in her listing.  We appreciated the light snacks and coffee along with her pamphlet of recommendations for restaurants and attractions.  The location is great just up a hill from the heart of the Castro.  We'd definitely stay here again!
20217846,268080872,2018-05-23,1663086,Tracy Ann,Amy's place was nice the building felt very secure. There was a miscommunication on scheduling and I ended up staying there with some other guests. It wasn't ideal especially since the rooms don't lock to provide any personal security or much privacy.  Amy communicated the misunderstanding a little too late for me to make other arrangements  so I had to keep the booking. t's not my ideal accommodation for work but if you're ok with strangers this spot is a great value in a new building.

3812931,19779773,2014-09-18,19696693,Ashley,Carter was such a great host! The place was beautiful and exactly what the pictures look like. It is in a great location with easy access to public transportation. We would definitely recommend staying with Carter and would gladly stay here again!
4902565,107858726,2016-10-12,80074656,Matt,We loved staying here the room is exactly as described.
25229521,543483817,2019-10-07,279816976,Samantha,A perfectly clean place with an amazingly easy check in! The location was more perfect than I could have planned for. THANK YOU! Gorgeous beach 2 blocks away makes for a scenic escape from the busy city. Much better than staying downtown.
7344289,66938076,2016-03-25,61550285,Feenando,Our stay is wonderful!! The location is really convenient. Clean and pretty. Everything you need is provided. 
7067681,237356482,2018-02-22,61578318,Jérémy,This youth hostel is simply wonderful. I would have stayed more. I highly recommand to go there. Location food ambiance all is great.
9752333,199403242,2017-10-01,1655652,Megan,Awesome space! Easy to take public transportation to the different areas of San Francisco. Thanks Peg!
3081560,41740416,2015-08-09,31880564,Naomi,This was an awesome stay! The hosts worked with our schedule and were great at communicating quickly. And the place!! Here's what the pictures don't show: heated bathroom floors stocked cabinets and hosts ready to give ideas for things to do and places to go.  We loved being close to the BART great restaurants and Dolores park. This is a gem and a real steal for the neighborhood. Highly recommended!
166771,92483582,2016-08-08,16346790,Nicole,We had an amazing experience at the Downey house! I immediately felt welcomed walking up to the door to find a sweet note from Patti ( which I saved ). The flat was so clean and beautiful I felt at home. It was in the incredible and quaint neighborhood of Haight/Ashbury. It was so walkable with so many nice cafes and shops. Would definitely stay here again!
19015884,342905855,2018-10-29,167104289,Halie,Best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Can’t wait to stay here again. The perfect environment and location!!!
12857179,304063123,2018-08-08,47144331,Melisa,I really enjoyed my stay here. It was my first time staying at a hostel and I was a bit hesitant. I have heard horror stories about hostels but I decided to give this one a try. I was in town for a conference and because San Fran is unreasonably expensive I needed a place that was affordable and safe. After reading the reviews I chose this place. I am very glad that I did! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They even have free ear plugs for those of us who need them! Thank you! 
4519780,189741790,2017-09-02,142877979,Leon,Great location inviting stuff. I liked the place.
3319447,329772728,2018-09-29,13733682,Christin,"I guess there is no better place to stay for a few days in SF. We were greeted with sweets slept excellent and had the perfect starting point for get to know this beautyful city. The apartment was clean and cozy furnished.

It was a bit tricky to find an affordable parking spot. (Our tip: the ABC parking near Kezar Pavillion). 

Thanks to Anna‘s tips we were able to enjoy some great wine and delicious sushi within walking distance. Absolutely recommendable!"
21058406,260135123,2018-05-03,14761266,Vanessa,had a super nice and comfortable stay! perfect for my business trip!
9532943,154077002,2017-05-22,50898063,Francis & Aoife,Tony was very accommodating excellent communication and instructions via text upon arrival. There are a lot of airbnb rooms in the building so bring earplugs just incase other guests disturb you coming and going. Close to Union Square good to sightseeing and shopping. 
4476390,121733917,2016-12-18,998610,James,"Though the host was not available to meet us on arrival he emailed clear instructions for how to get in.  However the unit is not marked with a room number and located between the garage and stairs to the actual apartments above. The behind-the-stairs entry felt a bit shady when we first arrived.

Although tastefully decorated the unit is almost underground located between the garage and the street-level stairs which lead up to the actual apartments in the building. Most likely converted from a laundry or storage room at some point the unit has no windows opening to the outside only two small windows in the kitchen above eye level which look into the covered parking garage with a trash can right in front. Opening them would only allow in car exhaust fumes so the unit gets no ventilation and no sunlight. It feels like nighttime 24 hours a day which really interfered with our sleep rhythm. There is no window at all in the bedroom. It felt like a dungeon. Aside from being uncomfortable it is also unsafe as you could easily be trapped in the event of a fire. The lack of an apartment number on the door only a keypad gives the appearance of a storage room which could easily be missed by emergency personnel. The unit also has no HVAC or air ducts. I doubt it is up to building code.

In addition tenants from the apartments above pass through the corridor en route to and from the garage from before 6am until late at night with doors at both ends slamming shut. All that noise plus a lot of bright light from the corridor enter the unit through the poorly sealed door. 

We had problems with gnats in the kitchen from the start. John the owner quickly responded with a home-made remedy. But after about 10 days during our month-long stay the gnats returned. I can only assume that the unit's close proximity to the trash can in the garage and the poor seal on the door are the cause.

There was also a foul smell of raw sewage coming from the bathroom sink the whole time. This was never resolved and I suspect that this unit at the bottom of the building is probably near the big sewer pipe that services the 12 actual units and is pretty susceptible to this.

The description says ""Executive Suite in Bernal Heights."" However it is not actually IN trendy Bernal Heights with all the nice shops and restaurants but about a 20-25 minute walk from it. It's on busy Mission Street near a lot of low-end businesses. You can get to Bernal Heights or Glen Park from the unit but it's not really in either. 

John was friendly and responsive when minor things needed fixing. The room is well-furnished. But to call it an ""executive suite"" and say its is ""in Bernal Heights"" is misleading. "
1920033,494649442,2019-07-24,46357151,Konstantin,It was great you almost felt like a part OK Kevin's family. Local tips and generous breakfast left good impression as well.
561148,41944466,2015-08-10,8329422,Catherine,Steve and Julie's place was the best decision we could have made for our trip. My sister and cousins always do a trip and their location near Golden Gate Park Haight and Ashbury and the beach was perfect for things to do.  They even were courteous enough to send us a list of local places to eat visit and check out during our stay a couple weeks before we arrived. The sleeping arrangements were fine beds were comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and it was really convenient I could pull my car in the garage during the day. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!
13788581,438874522,2019-04-17,2394596,Caroline,Ryan's place is great with lots of natural sunlight and a wonderful backyard. Location is convenient and walkable to lots of local cafes and great neighborhood. Check in/out was easy. Ryan was helpful in accommodating our request for an earlier check in as well.
4464347,23131823,2014-11-23,20903434,Mika,Had a great stay at the Green Tortoise this past weekend. The staff was warm friendly and so helpful. Great with recommendations around the city. Clean hostel in itself. Free breakfast in the morning was a nice treat. Nothing to complain about--would definitely stay here again and will look to them first next time I visit San Francisco!
4439461,226100963,2018-01-08,18425931,Gayle,Our two-night stay at Jeffrey's was relaxing and pleasant.  We enjoyed the tasteful furnishings--the bedside lamps the ceiling fan the spa-like bathroom. The small size of the room was offset by the 12-ft ceiling which gave us a sense of more space.  We especially liked the fabulous restaurant choices right outside the front door.  The long staircase leading to the room was either good exercise or a challenge depending on one's fitness or mood.
14488234,421101369,2019-03-08,30600656,Yein,Jason & Jerrett were hospitable and everything was as described in the description. They were great hosts and the Airbnb was a great space. I would highly recommend!
1356129,72918825,2016-05-05,46236648,Chris,Between the easy check in / late check out house book with neighborhood recommendations and the clean & spacious room I had a wonderful two day stay. Will definitely be sure to check if it's available next time I'm visiting.
15270469,262067669,2018-05-07,95799965,Blake,Lovely place Michele is very accommodating
7054235,76224676,2016-05-25,35634601,Jonas,"We stayed 8 nights and we can definitively recommend the apartment!
The room is very spacious and modern and there is a nice backyard.
Only 2min to the beach and 45min to Downtown via public transportation(N-line on Judah).
No kitchen but there are restaurants and a nice bakery nearby.
All in all we enjoyed our time there and would stay there again!"
17982304,361089085,2018-12-22,133746651,Jessica,Great place and location spacious and cozy at the same time. Excited to stay here with my mom next visit to SF!
27056649,472960844,2019-06-20,24414682,Sasiwan,Nice place super clean safe and located in a lovely neighborhood near Muni bus & tram & shopping mall. Perfect staying!!
20906522,262417053,2018-05-08,101935053,Getenet,Great place. Great host. Thanks.
21529297,409108284,2019-02-06,153760281,Giedrius,Charlie’s place was very clean and tidy. I liked his recommendations about the city. He provided lots of information about sightseeing and transportation.
16831471,400649857,2019-01-12,22055555,Meredith,Helen & Jojo are truly one of a kind hosts. Their place is beautiful clean and comfortable.  My favorite part about staying with them was how warm and welcoming they were to me throughout my stay.  I will definitely be rebooking with them anytime I have to stay in SF for work or fun.  They anticipated all of my travel needs ahead of time and provided such a fun experience in their home. So glad we met!
17718199,553259446,2019-10-23,89572414,Thomas,"Igor was an amazing host. The room was exactly as advertised clean comfy quiet and well located. 
Also thank you for the bottle of wine.

Thomas"
20768833,214844718,2017-11-26,5960147,Henry,Beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood with beautiful views of the city. Four story home that truly lives up to the “treehouse” description.
437385,6893980,2013-08-29,7103702,Barbara,My husband and I stayed at Wolfe Point Place while visiting our son who lives right nearby. Melanie's home provided the perfect home base for our stay. The room is pleasant well-appointed and quiet at night. And it was nice to have space to spread out a little in the common area. Melanie is generous kind helpful and interesting. She gave us excellent suggestions was fun to talk with made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed and more. She is someone I would value staying in touch with. We would definitely consider staying with Melanie again.
12857087,305079744,2018-08-10,155164979,Michael,Best hotel experience I have had. Everyday you get the opportunity to make and meet people just at the hostel. Amazing and I will remember the experience forever
1992217,35565360,2015-06-20,2762461,María Laura,"Peter's place has amazing views and a very comfortable room. The room itself was immaculate and having a private bathroom within was good and nice for privacy. 

Peter was a super friendly and a adorable host he was so helpful with our suitcases and even prepared breakfast for us every day.

The location is great safe and easy access to public transportation/street parking. The house is on one of the nicest areas of San Francisco and very close to the wonderful Dolores Park. 

We highly recommend to stay at peter's place and would definitely come back if we find ourselves in SFO again!

16700935,236239038,2018-02-18,60984770,Misan,We enjoyed our stay. Sparkling clean and modern style studio basement apartment. Great view of SF and walking distance from eateries and shops.
18904,4074248,2013-04-08,4544587,Aarón Julio,Estuvimos cinco noches en la casa de Patrick y fue una gran experiencia. Estar en un lugar tan cómodo y agradable nos ayudo a que nuestra estadía en San Francisco fuera inolvidable. Patrick es un gran anfitrión. Es discreto y amable se preocupa por las necesidades de sus huéspedes y comparte su casa con naturalidad y alegría. 
728486,6486233,2013-08-14,5921840,Brian,The pictures capture this condo perfectly. It's a great open space and in a great location. Peter and John were also very available. The auxiliary cable to play music on the stereo was a huge plus. I wish I could've stayed longer. Thanks for the accommodation!
7972067,131102912,2017-02-10,113053418,Anouck,"Great place great people. Perfect to Stay in peace in SF. Only problem; we really hear everything in the house. Close to everything.
We are very Happy to this place! =)"

17285258,258845986,2018-04-29,10502962,Zaid,Tania was great place was great. Bar across the street can be quite noisy but read about it in the reviews before. All in all great spot and would stay again.
21070256,355039849,2018-12-02,104730094,Robert,"Fast polite and extremely friendly upon check in. Bob and his mother were so extremely kind. The neighborhood was beautiful and the location for restaurants was close and convenient. 

Bob made sure to answer any questions we had about local cuisine and was always on top of making sure we were comfortable. I’m glad I choose this location and look forward to my next visit. Thank you Bob for the wonderful stay."
9051149,171502654,2017-07-17,53041322,Dana,My husband and I needed a place to stay in the city for one night after a family weekend trip to the beaches south of San Francisco.   Elmer's place was perfect due to it's proximity to our son's apartment and public transportation to the airport.   We weren't there for long but we had a nice visit with Elmer when we checked in and we enjoyed our morning hanging out with his dog London.  Everything was clean and as described in his listing.
23630,1102462,2012-04-09,1665939,Robert,"I have nothing but good things to say.  The suite is exactly as described and very very convenient to life in the Castro if that's what you're looking for.  Of course being in the Castro it's very convenient to bus/metro access to the rest of the city should walking the hills of San Francisco prove too daunting.

I didn't have the chance to meet Daniel during my stay but he was responsive to inquiries I sent to him via text.  I briefly met Andy when I arrived and he was perfectly pleasant.  I appreciated the ""hands off"" approach."
1665516,559828826,2019-11-04,20510433,Caroline,"This is a lovely homely place from which to explore San Francisco.
It’s a comfortable sunny well decorated apartment."
3081560,257315272,2018-04-25,112067657,Gerrod,Beautiful & clean space in an awesome location! Would highly recommend staying here.
7181279,441299337,2019-04-21,54323011,Anthony,I would say overall this place is good however due to the loud construction noise and the bed sheets it was just not ideal for me and my wife.  She was traveling from overseas and preferred to at least sleep until 10 am.
10889831,488109018,2019-07-14,9517067,Tess,Danna is great! Her house is lovely in a quiet location she is gracious and goes over and above to make your stay special.

1525886,252922020,2018-04-12,80789195,Barb,Easy access / short drive from airport. As a woman travelling alone I felt very comfortable here. Beautiful home and great location.
24559691,471594153,2019-06-17,23534304,Heather,Exactly as described. Plenty of room for us and our four kids. Lovely kitchen and bathroom. Appreciated being able to park our car securely within the building.
457986,38721172,2015-07-18,12790595,Solarpraxis AG,Comfortable practical and perfect for what we were after. We found the apartment simply ideal. The local food - from the markets to the restaurants - was Latin awesomeness and an added bonus. Highly recommend for a slightly bigger traveling party (bigger than two or three that is) who are willing to travel just a little further to get into town. 
394575,6842060,2013-08-27,3387420,Giovanni,I have nothing but great things to say about Mike Nic and their place! I stayed for over a week and really felt at home. Mike does a great job of communicating any details one may need before arriving and makes himself readily available in case any issues do arise (although there were none during my stay). The place looked exactly like the pictures and was true to its name (it is very cozy!). They even make an effort to make sure the cupboards and fridge are stocked with a few things for your stay (in addition to the usual staples you would need for cooking and coffee). Not expected at all but really appreciated during mornings/late nights where you could use a refreshment or something to nibble on. I was able to meet Nic towards the end of my stay and she was a delight to talk to Very warm and engaging you could tell she really does love the neighborhood and city. There are a few bus lines that stop within walking distance of their place (on is right on the corner) so getting into the city and back was never an issue. The neighborhood itself felt really safe and I was able to enjoy some of the restaurants and shops on Courtland Street (just a block south). Would recommend without hesitation to any Airbnb user thanks!  
2074584,147620676,2017-04-27,79904121,Robin,"This is a cute cottage centrally located close to public transport (BART MUNI bus) restaurants and downtown San Francisco (approximately 10-15 minutes by bus or 1-2 stops on the BART).  The cottage itself is only suitable for 2 people comfortably (due to size) and is fitted out with a basic kitchen (e.g. coffee press knives bar fridge microwave dishes etc.).   

What we loved:
*Within walking distance of restaurants cafes Wholefoods public transport and Dolores Park.
*The cottage has high ceilings with skylights which was nice to wake up to.
*Clean and tidy nice shower and comfortable bed.
*Easy check-in and check-out.
The neighborhood:
The hosts provided us a 'heads up' about the neighborhood and in particular a small group of homeless living in the alley way near the cottage.  We didn't have any issues with the group - they were friendly and waved to us each morning.  They are two alley way entrances to reach the cottage and we predominately used the Valencia St entrance (i.e. where the homeless are not living) to reach the cottage.  I was visiting SF with my 72 year old mother and felt safe at all times. Having said that generally you probably don't want to be out real late (say 11/12pm) in the Mission District anyway - it's colorful but it can be unsafe in certain areas late at night just like any other city.  For the majority of our stay the cottage was pretty quiet however on the Friday and Saturday nights of our stay I used ear plugs as it got noisy when the homeless were having a few beverages in the alley way!  Otherwise the remainder of our stay Sunday to Wednesday night was uneventful and we slept well.  
 
We would definitely stay at this cottage again and I'd recommend it to friends and family.  Thanks for having us Autumn and Richie :)"
10835637,236585935,2018-02-19,104257792,Violeta,"Location was great. Check-in was easy. Luckily I found parking around the corner which was something I was worried about. 
Hosts were pleasant. 

Although I did find a used fake eyelash in my bedding thankfully I am not a squeamish  person.
 
One day upon returning from sight seeing our main room was locked. Leaving us temporarily locked out. Host described it as 'accident'.
Mmmm.... interesting."
3594786,326622284,2018-09-22,3232635,Andrew,I've lost count of the number of AirBnbs I have stayed in the Bay Area over the last 5 years it must be at least 40. But I can say categorically that I have never stayed anywhere nicer than Insiya & Sean's place. Not just spacious and stylish but such a great location super-helpful hosts and wonderful touches throughout. I just wish we had been here long enough to hang out and enjoy the apartment more! Just one more thing to add to my bucket list for next time. Thanks so much Insiya and Sean hope to stay with you again soon!
11531859,138444054,2017-03-19,116623995,Sebastian,It was a pleasure to stay here again. I felt very comfortable in Kathy's accomodation. I really like and respect independence and this place is giving it.

Thanks Amy!"
32747602,532956497,2019-09-20,256203538,Glenn,Basement apartment at best and not worth the listing price.
13548606,510199752,2019-08-15,95483217,Davis,"Note: Xiongda Vic is not the actual host of this property. It and other properties listed on Airbnb are managed by Nisha at Boutikia.

I recently stayed in San Francisco for a summer internship and booked this room for 3 months.  4 DAYS before I was supposed to move in this host called and informed me that the room had been ""double booked"" when in reality the person staying in the room I was supposed to move into offered to pay cash under the table to extend (confirmed later).  The host offered to put me up in a secondary house off Divisadero St. Told me I was getting an ""Incredible deal"" and would likely have my own room & bathroom. This was far from reality. I ended up being crammed into an outdated unkept house with 7 other random roommates all sharing 1 bathroom. 

A month into my stay the host contacted me requesting me to move back into the original house I was supposed to stay in however into a room that was not much more than a closet. After continuously pressuring me to move out we finally agreed on them putting me up in a hotel for the remainder of my stay.

Avoid this host and any affiliates at all cost. They have horrible business practices and do not care about anything else except for bookings."

12562572,268669744,2018-05-25,34363940,Oliver,Brad and Ray were excellent hosts who made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. The accomodation was clean spacious and filled with thoughtful touches. My wife and I would thoroughly recommend this property - a peaceful neighbourhood but still closr enough to enjoy the city and places such as Twin Peaks. Thank you both!
21111066,409412765,2019-02-07,10592537,Nicolas,"Dayna's apartment is next to Japantown and in a nice quite neighboorhood.  It has large windows and lets a lot of sunshine in which I like very much.  Dayna is a very good host and made sure I had everything I needed and provided some local tips. 

I was attending a conference at the Moscone center and typically took one of the city bike shares to get to the Moscone center in about 10 minutes.  

I would stay here again."

12511163,538492545,2019-09-29,285330832,Arge,Great place to stay if you're headed to the United Irish Cultural Center of the Zoo.
5944921,529356861,2019-09-14,25378408,Ishan,Great place great person great location great stay.
9882716,181415615,2017-08-12,24107836,Phil,Donna's place is much bigger than it appears in pictures which made for a very comfortable stay for our family.  It was very clean and in a convenient location for exploring San Francisco.  Donna greeted us in person and was very nice to allow us to store luggage due to our early arrival.  I would definitely recommend Donna's location for travelers to SF.
201579,157158504,2017-06-02,129626840,Nick,This is the best place to stay in San Francisco.  You are centrally located to everything and the flat is beautiful.    
12175415,199319320,2017-10-01,150510292,Stacey,It was better than home I didn't want to  leave!!  Deborah was very accommodating and flexible!  I only wish I had spent more time at Deborah's place during my stay there to enjoy it more!
1059961,14519519,2014-06-21,6446479,Kim,Laura and David's apartment was fantastic.  It's clean modern spacious comfortable (especially the bed) and in a great location.  We were able to walk most places or catch a cab outside their front door if we needed a lift.  Laura and David are very friendly and laid back. I absolutely recommend their apartment to anyone visiting San Fran.  
9051149,233037790,2018-02-07,2854583,Amy,Wow!  What a great location-close to parks restaurants bars and beautiful houses.  The bed was super comfortable and Elmer was very kind and responsive.  Definitely a great place to stay in SF.
13735664,349216875,2018-11-16,3796773,Chris,"I’ve stayed in many great places through Airbnb over the years but this was the first time I stayed in a private room instead of renting the entire home.  I wasn’t sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised once I arrived.  

Linda and Raul’s home is as nice as the photos and everything was impeccably clean. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that Linda made breakfast and her mother helped iron my shirts for work.  However the best part of this stay was our morning chats over breakfast which made my visit feel less like renting a room and more like staying at a friend’s home.  I look forward to visiting my new friends again soon."
13603043,104464983,2016-09-26,91979454,Nicholas,The cozier of cozy in San Francisco! It's nestled between some of the greatest parts of the city. Walk to Dolores park or out to some great restaurants. Shall was there every step of the way and really makes you feel at home. Thanks again!
2274353,12127117,2014-04-23,13247961,Aba,The apartment is in a really quiet and peaceful neighborhood with a Safeway and Walmart within walking distance. Its location is near BART and MUNI stops so its easy to get into Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square to explore. Even though we didn't need them as hosts Chris and Tina made sure that if you needed help they were easily contactable. Its perfect for families or couples looking to explore San Francisco.
1907229,132062939,2017-02-15,114540037,Greg,Neeta is very accommodating the property is neat as a pin it has classic San Francisco architecture and the location is good for in-town business.  While we were three business colleagues in town for meetings the property could readily serve a family or group of up to 7-8 people.  Travelers should note that while our schedule did not provide time to use the beautiful backyard it is a nice feature.  However your are only able to use it in the evenings as it is shared with a preschool.  The only other caveat is that there is no dedicated parking although to be clear we had no trouble finding a parking spot either on the property's street or one street over even at late hours in the evening.  To those looking for a gym nearby the JCCSF is just 0.4 mi away and a quick jog over.  All in all we had a great experience and will undoubtedly be back!  
4936887,286222533,2018-07-05,26822016,Masato,Simone's place is great. It is very spacious and full of nice amenities (my kids especially loved the pool table and cool books). The location is also great and you get a full lot for parking. Just one little thing - as someone who plays piano I wished the piano was actually playable (it is not). I'd stay at Simone's place again :)
14907455,542787852,2019-10-06,13372535,Werner,Fantastic location superclean rooms outstanding location near Bart. I would like to recommend to everybody who likes to stay to a reasonable price.
4902907,76775959,2016-05-29,198680,Nadia,Place was great! Clean safe and close to great landmarks! 
1985338,49757467,2015-10-06,3018823,Olaf,Eine wunderbare Adresse in San Francisco. Ruhig und sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet mit einer sehr schönen Terrasse. Würden Nicole und Julian jederzeit wieder aufsuchen und jedem empfehlen der in die Stadt kommt.
277339,133840170,2017-02-25,30143270,Berengere,"Very much enjoyed our stay here. Home close to train and Muni very easy (and cheap) access to the main parts of the city.
The house is also quite spacious and in a residential area which is nice and quiet.
Hosts were lovely and went over and beyond to ensure we were okay everyday ! Thanks again !!!"
13788749,557705015,2019-11-01,257073609,Eugene,I enjoyed my stay at Kandle's. She was very nice and she provided an easy check-in/out process. This place gets 5 beans!
4902444,211414349,2017-11-12,28804706,Hellen,Green Tortoises is an awesome hostel with cool events available for the lonely traveller
256148,34814981,2015-06-12,34746684,Amy,Great experience. The place was very clean and exactly as described- comfortable bed strong WiFi connection and numerous amenities. Chris is very organized and ensures you are well informed for checking in and out. I highly recommend this location. 
6336315,401501439,2019-01-14,12907570,Marian,We stayed with Robert for 11 days.  He was totally friendly warm and good company.  He would sit and chat with us or leave us to ourselves as the evenings progressed.  We definitely would recommend his airbnb to anyone wanting to spend some time in San Francisco.
14142409,159109574,2017-06-09,48191071,Pietro,Perfect Location! everything you need is there!!
348714,27093835,2015-02-25,5024340,Jonathan,Great house nice semi-private patio all of it away from the street giving it a very safe and peaceful feel. The whole neighborhood is quiet and beautiful quintessential San Francisco. My only complaint is that the bed is a little too firm but I'd stay again.
31465464,564392763,2019-11-15,59629810,Lyon,Really delightful place. Amazing host. Highly recommend
20803354,531108076,2019-09-16,4500400,Kiera,Great location comfy bed and easy check in. Sion was very communicative over text and in person with some local recommendations. The neighborhood is very lively with lots of things to do within walking distance.
21790140,308584263,2018-08-16,208463509,Ahmed,Its an awesome place.Cozy bed! Check-in was so easy. Location is great but keep in mind that finding parking may be difficult. Overall it’s great!
1478708,285816006,2018-07-04,41003698,Amy,Easy peasy and a lovely breakfast spread!
585225,2596649,2012-10-13,3575081,Ariane,The studio is nicely located close to MUNI transport 24th street and The Mission. Noe Valley is a quiet clean and fun neighbourhood with nice Café and restaurants. The studio was clean felt safe quiet affordable and well decorated. Even though we had spent most of our stay outside the studio it was great to come back for a good sleep in this cozy apartment. You get everything you need to enjoy your stay. Gabriel is a great host. We would highly recommend.
5013816,35298758,2015-06-17,7795666,Kirsten,Our hosts Jeff and Mike were awesome. From the time we arrived (a bit late!) to when we left (also a bit late) they were accommodating kind and very responsive. They allowed us to leave our bags for a few hours so we could do some activities unencumbered which was very much appreciated. The room itself was immaculate and incredibly spacious. I'm not sure I have enough words to describe how lovely our room was it certainly topped many 4 star restaurants I've stayed at. I would recommend this AirBnB to anyone I know as long as they are okay with stairs (it is San Francisco after all!). 
1205031,43966929,2015-08-23,10714679,Sébastien,Always a pleasure to stay at Wilmer's. 10/10 would recommend :-)
1767543,77365086,2016-05-31,7453964,Alice,The unit inside is nice with upgraded kitchen and bathroom. Bedrooms were adequate as well. The futon was broken when we stayed but the host was responsive about this. The exterior of the building and the walkway up to the unit could use a little work as stated in other reviews. Overall good quiet location. Parking occasionally a bit challenging.
29416786,436294519,2019-04-12,249865579,Scott,Good location for a great price.  If you need a place to stay and don't mind a shared bathroom or no in-room tv this is what you need.  I slept very well and Alice is a great hostess.  She is extremely responsive and helpful.
31803551,482606670,2019-07-06,8837718,Jose,Excellent -- highly recommended. A nice location and the room is clean and well-kept.
28784618,512962807,2019-08-18,59827825,Caroline,We stayed at Springer’s home while in town for a wedding - my first time in SF - and were absolutely enchanted by it! From the cozy and very Instagrammable library to the peaceful intimate patio each space made us want to enjoy our time and helped us to relax after busy days out on the town. Springer was highly attentive to our every need and made sure that our stay was comfy and cozy. We would definitely stay again!!
142177,429035899,2019-03-26,142438598,Laura,We had a wonderful stay at Noreen’s. She answered all our questions prior to our trip. We arrived late in the evening and she provided self check-in instructions that worked perfect. The condo is just as described and very clean and nicely accommodated. There was a coffee shop a block away that had great coffee and rolls for breakfast. There are many so many stores shops and cafes within blocks. The neighborhood seemed very safe and was very quiet. We absolutely recommend this place!
17991554,404118345,2019-01-22,124872313,Terra,We had a great time while in San Francisco! Our space was clean and very private. Loved the location. Close to food the park buses etc.
2486953,20843691,2014-10-06,5263187,Jason,"I can only echo what previous reviewers have already mentioned - Vincent was an excellent host and made every effort to ensure our stay was comfortable... including providing sparkling mineral water and chocolates upon our arrival! 

This studio apartment is below the main house yet it's very private and quiet with separate access and key. 

The bed is super comfortable the bathroom is amazing and the entire unit is impeccably clean. The attention to detail is impressive.

The location is perfect for a stroll down Castro St and is close to transport cafes bars and restaurants. Highly recommended!!"
20388193,196308944,2017-09-22,127457247,Daniel,"The house or rather the ""castle"" from Paul is huge. We had a very comfartable room with a good bed and a big flatscreen. If you come to San Francisco to make Sightseeing you will need a car or rather you have to use the train. At the 3rd street you find some simple reastaurants. It is a walk of 5 minutes."
19228919,410775193,2019-02-10,9148967,Ryan,absolutely fabulous and convenient.
1620411,343189537,2018-10-30,3540780,Alissa,Such a great stay! Comfortable and spacious and great location. It'll be at the top of my list for future visits.
12725886,345951934,2018-11-06,221260853,Nathan,Expect timely responses a clean room and bathroom and a comfortable bed.
4463165,32469371,2015-05-18,3195873,John,"We had a wonderful time staying with Valerie and would highly recommend her place to anyone staying in San Francisco.  The room was just as advertised and the bed was perfect.

Thanks again for the hospitality!    "
18785944,420141258,2019-03-05,73217078,Michael,We stayed in room A and it was an amazing experience. The house is so easy to get to (about $30 on Uber from SFO) and so easy to spot! They were so accommodating and always responded promptly. We asked to drop off our bags early because we took an early flight and they gave us instructions on where to leave them within the house. Turns out they let us check in almost 3 hours early!The use of multiple keypads and different codes for each made me feel extremely safe. They provide breakfast items including eggs and bread and the convenience of providing an oven/microwave/dishes helped us enjoy your leftovers. Just a short walk to a Safeway to get anything you may have forgotten the house is in a prime location near the L Muni as well as multiple bus lines. If you stay here I recommend getting the Muni passport to take it all over SF. This house is also close to the 16th Ave tiled steps and although the view when we went was foggy I can't imagine how amazing it would be on a clear day. If you're worried about walking back from public transit at night don't worry because it's a really safe area to be in. If you're visiting SF you'd be foolish to pass up on staying here versus staying in Tenderloin for $500/night. I promise I wasn't paid to write this not did they ask me to but this was such an amazing first Airbnb experience and I feel like my review wouldn't do this place justice. I hope to be back again soon! Thanks Victor Christiana and Felicia!
29192965,457280321,2019-05-23,138101688,Hideaki,Great stay! Thanks!
162934,164307938,2017-06-26,39578354,Theresa,Communication and check in worked perfectly fine and the area is nice as well a bit outside but if you're ok with taking the bus it's no problem.
10156101,553673089,2019-10-24,4396826,Robert Marshall,Jeff's place is just as advertised. Clean. Great location and affordable price!
515430,32946171,2015-05-23,359056,Stephan,I stayed here for 2 days while looking for something more permanent. The cottage is located in a great safe neighbourhood with lots of little restaurants around. I didn't meet Christa until my last day but she gave me thorough instructions on where to find the key as well as helpful information on the area. Overall a very enjoyable experience and highly recommended.
20367880,194059284,2017-09-15,149645684,Bryan,"Booking and communication were really easy with Je and Darren.  Daniel also helped a lot and was very prompt with replies!  Everything was very clean and the room was definitely enough for the few days we stayed.  Unfortunately another guest in one of their other rooms left their front door open to air things out or keep cool so there were a number of mosquitoes that got in.  Nothing Je and Darren could have anticipated but it comes with the territory of a shared space.  I did like the fact that the fridge was sectioned off for each room though to ensure it's not a free for all for space :)

Just an FYI for anyone driving - parking was a minor issue but Je and Darren made us well aware of the situation before we arrived.  Street parking is free but it is first come first serve and each street has different street cleaning days so if you are not leaving by 8am each day you may need to move your car to another street over to avoid a ticket.

Other than that the stay was great and I would recommend it for anyone staying in SF!"
23583822,499651356,2019-07-31,129118177,Victor,Very clean though slightly noisy between rooms. However it is a very convenient and affordable place I recommend.
10840593,126682295,2017-01-13,30112616,Huy Truong Nam,Bill and Aileen were fantastic hosts. Their apartment is small but so cozy and beautiful. Note the the apartment is in the basement but with ventilation it never gets stuffy. The hosts also provided us with valuable information about the neighborhood which was handy. Complimentary wine was great! Thanks for the stay.
6437010,74274248,2016-05-14,2668513,Shalini,Joanne is a warm and accomodating host. We stayed in her lounge room which converts nicely into a private double bedroom with plenty of beautiful light. The apartment is clean and well located. We were very comfortable.
2956406,81225965,2016-06-21,5769528,Zohaib And Megan,Simon was very welcoming and friendly. The room was extremely clean and everything was well provided. The location was great as well. We had a car and we were a short drive to most of the major sites. We had a very enjoyable stay.
15177460,329412312,2018-09-28,207714571,Mahiti,"Kirsten's place is located a stone's throw away from the 'Painted Ladies' near Alamo Square. The home has a great view and all necessary amenities.

Kirsten is a warm host and would recommend this listing :)"
5094146,104652708,2016-09-27,9848223,Edward,I had a wonderful stay with Abhay and the friendliest dog I've ever met Cody. The room is small but it is perfectly comfortable. For me the best thing about this apartment is the location. Noe Valley is a lovely residential neighbourhood but is within a short walk of both the Castro and the Mission my two favourite San Francisco areas. There is also a bus less than a minutes walk from the flat. I will happily stay here again it was a great base for exploring the city. 
14426130,128802295,2017-01-27,77519001,영서,It was great stay here. The room was very clean and had everything that I needed. Also David was very nice and kind. Desmo was lovely too. I do recommend this place.
21730505,426322800,2019-03-20,245208991,Michael,Parking is difficult
10517693,109039433,2016-10-18,48540394,Vicki,Arcene made us most welcome and especially like the little post-it-notes on how the place works. The location was perfect and if we ever move to San Fran this is the neighborhood we would love to live in (great restaurants bars and a Whole Foods a short walk down the road). It was also handy to the city and it made our first trip to San Fran memorable.
1474209,13584712,2014-05-31,13701225,Lara,"Dana was prompt and professional. As others said the place functioned like a hotel so there wasn't much ""character"" to it like other airbnb's but it was extremely convenient. WiFi was a bit spotty but the bed was SO comfortable!"
27627816,321967806,2018-09-11,94884867,Claire,This is a great place especially if you’re looking for more room than a hotel can offer. I can’t comment on access to public transportation as we used our car during the stay. The place is updated and clean. He has provided several amenities plus there is a full kitchen. Steve clearly cares about his guests as he was always quick to respond to my messages and made sure our stay was comfortable. This was my first time in San Francisco so I wasn’t sure where everything is located. At no time did I feel unsafe and I even went on my usual morning run during the stay. I definitely recommend booking this place before someone else does!
794626,122311582,2016-12-22,4896504,Kristin,This a great place that is just as described/pictured. It was clean and there are tons of towels and linens. Loved the shower. We had a great stay. I definitely recommend the place. 
4287481,257562858,2018-04-26,34872549,Wilmer,Great location and really cozy place.
21026964,340406360,2018-10-23,3947477,Mary Ann,The on-line description and photos were accurate.  This is a friendly eclectic hostel environment with delicious breakfast options. Reasonable cost compared to SF hotels.
20575733,210153650,2017-11-07,84814712,Young Won,Very clean and comfortable! Nice location as well. Hosts are so kind and generous :) would love to stay here again
748222,161067935,2017-06-16,101349346,Atsuko,"I really enjoyed staying here. The place was clean comfortable well-decorated. The host was so nice giving me a lot of advice where and how to visit places. The place was located kind of ""hip area"" it looked a little bit unsafe at first but it was not bad as it looked. I walked around outside late at night 10 - 11pm and didn't have any problem with it. I definitely recommend this place for you to stay."
16900525,138005267,2017-03-18,139669,Alanna,Scott's place was immaculate. Very well designed and furnished and it feels like a home. Scott's friend Tarin checked me in and was super friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.
13096400,194372379,2017-09-16,58123158,Chiao Chun,A bit noisy outside at night but very convenient. Right next to union square easy to go everywhere.
7949624,297377156,2018-07-27,5468554,Mark,Fantastic airbnb for business travel 
25662,419851,2011-08-04,117239,Howard,Great host Gayle! Very good source on restaurants ways to get around the city. Very nice space and garden. Good neighborhood and yes good parking. Easy 5 min drive into downtown. Definite revisit. 
51773,1974236,2012-08-13,3107639,Andy,Jay made my stay in San Francisco very enjoyable. I arrived to the city late in the evening and she was happy to open the door for me. While I did not get the opportunity to hang out with her she was more than accommodating. The room is as described small and cozy and fully adequate with a comfortable bed desk and chair closet and chest of drawers. The other guests staying at her place were also pleasant. A recommended place to stay for the casual traveler.
2736358,346754689,2018-11-09,5035850,Aaron,Great stay at Sara’s place. Location is amazing and so close to everything. Found parking on street the entire time. Thanks Sara.
3611131,347743965,2018-11-11,724434,Lieghti,Mylinh had clear and thorough communication before and during the reservation. The listing was clean  but upon opening the door that first night there was an overwhelming smell of mold.  I tried to air the place out by opening the windows but it was cold at night. The wifi didn't work the first night which was a hassle because I planned on working from my listing. I had to leave to find a place that had a wifi connection. That issue was resolved the afternoon of the second day.  I wouldn't recommend staying at this listing.
18450146,337846070,2018-10-17,8641307,Brian,Great experience staying here.  Peter was easy to work with.  Instructions and description of the place were right on.   Solid WiFi.   You're about 15 minute walk from the Park.   Quiet neighborhood.  Easy to find parking on the street.
8084285,56778840,2015-12-18,20241632,Michael,I had a wonderful stay at this hotel/timeshare. I didn't know it was a timeshare until after booking but they didn't even bother me once the entire stay. Beautiful place and good location. Within walking distance to the shopping area and food.
10981310,285804581,2018-07-04,188931732,Luis,Second time that we stayed and everything was perfect.
4549330,507624144,2019-08-11,29194910,Christy,Ari’s place was sparkling clean! You can tell she put a lot of efforts into decorating her place and she made sure there was enough supplies for everyone to use. I definitely recommend it.
27832283,341003519,2018-10-25,43637012,Sophea,This is our second time staying at Marcia’s place and it’s even better the second time around. Marcia’s place  is very cozy clean and private.   We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town!
1393654,186495739,2017-08-24,59767080,Patrick,"Hi Kevin

We very much enjoyed our stay at your place and especially appreciated all your advice regarding sightseeing safety and saving money in San Francisco. Highly recommended."
22230201,239443032,2018-03-01,149306999,Arushi,Carols place was beautifully done up with great views. I had a great stay.
4909117,224652217,2018-01-03,14516975,Santiago,The place has a central location and is very clean. It is true that the tenderloin is not the best neighborhood but it is safe to walk.
567239,11458783,2014-04-03,13496047,Rodrigo,Judy and Ed are excellent hosts they are super friendly and helpful.  I stayed at their house for 3 days and it was great it is at a perfect location and the views of the city are amazing.
585225,272990660,2018-06-04,11654854,Carly,This space was perfect for my partner and I - it was close to all the neighbourhoods we wanted to check out lots of great little shops and places to eat. The weather was awesome so we were out for most of the day but it was the perfect place to relax. Clean quiet and cool we’d love to visit again. Thanks!
3850,9818249,2014-01-12,1977197,Christopher,"There are so many great things about this fantastic host and the lovely room I had the pleasure of staying in but here are my Top 5:

1. Your host is warm kind and incredibly generous
2. The location is accessible to the City Center and everywhere imaginable one wants to be in San Francisco
3. The room came complete with things you might forget- like a shower towel- which speaks volumes about this host's graciousness.
4. The view overlooking the City in this home to be very frank is simply stunning
5. The house is close to major public transit centers. 

My only critique? Just wish there were more restaurants and shops near the house but alas I live in Brooklyn NY so I am rather spoiled in this regard. :) 

You may find cheaper deals or ones w/ more ambiance but for the money service and simple hospitality of this host you should look no further.

The apartment is just what you need to stay in San Francisco. 2 bedrooms with comfy beds sofa bed a lot of cushions blankets equipped kitchen nice restroom and cute backyard.

44032,2036900,2012-08-20,2039553,Kelly,"My husband and I spent our 25th Anniversary touring Northern California and the Secret Lounge was our last stop before leaving for home.  We had a great time and thought David and his wife were 
very helpful in navigating the city very nice considerate people.

They seemed to have thought of everything and the place was very comfortable."
379349,539605925,2019-10-01,99248724,Roz,Great location to explore a really funky part of San Francisco close to many interesting restaurants bars and boutiques.  A relaxing space with interesting books to browse through and we were greeted with a lovely home baked banana cake.
1229606,18541907,2014-08-28,17789632,Kelley,We had a wonderful experience at John's condo. The place was exactly as we expected – clean modern and spacious for our group of four. The living room area doubles as an extra bedroom and was perfect for my brother in law who slept on the fold out couch. Location was central to all the major sights in San Francisco. Only drawbacks are the parking situation there is only street parking available and there are some homeless people that traverse the area. Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy all of the amenities the place has to offer...kitchen BBQ grill etc. 
22970151,249197113,2018-04-01,157131496,Claudio,The house was great and the location near the warf and bus stops
6430646,68119641,2016-04-02,5939261,Anne,David's space is a perfect base for a trip to San Francisco. The self contained room allows you total privacy yet with the comfort of knowing anything you need is just up the stairs. David was really welcoming and kind and his two cats are totally adorable! The neighbourhood is great and David took great care of us and made us feel very welcome in his home. We also got some great restaurant and site seeing tips! A perfect stay!

It was very comfortable and was equipped with everything we needed or could have needed. We enjoyed the wonderful patio for breakfast.

7715542,68343034,2016-04-04,6739618,Hannah-Hunt,A cozy apartment and good location. Tight but worked perfectly for 3 girls in for the weekend!
15132855,313102480,2018-08-24,40060,Dana,Erin is a long time local and very thoughtful host.  My husband and I enjoyed staying at her place very much.  She  provided all sorts of useful info regarding restaurants cocktails parking and local attractions.   Her home is in a great location near the Marina and Fort Mason which has become a cool area with shops and restaurants.  Her place is clean and in a safe area and easy to Uber to other parts of town. It was fun to watch a movie on the home theater system and  couches in the living room were very comfortable to lounge on.  
26635646,523913619,2019-09-04,272768161,Tormain,The place is beautiful!! Lot's of request to enter the property during our stay.  If you are staying and don't mind the request for entering the property you'll be fine.
4550843,463181529,2019-06-02,89752434,Nilton Marcos,John and Maria are very friendly and attentive!  everything we need had quick answers.  This was our first experience using Airbnb!  We had a fantastic experience. We hope to find owners like John and Mary in all our other locations !!
17382326,240730219,2018-03-05,70075014,Rebecca,This place is amazing. Go to sleep to the sound of the ocean and wake up to sunrise over the waves. I stayed for a work trip and wanted to be a away from the tech hubbub. It was perfect and the drive into downtown across Gold Gate Park was lovely and serene.  It was everything I was hoping for and more!
35674827,534412385,2019-09-22,40478124,Vildana,Great Location Restaurants and Cafés in walking distance.
12741695,409376613,2019-02-07,15578210,Emily,David's studio is a great find. It's near the beach (I recommend walking to breakfast at Java Beach) and Golden Gate Park (so much to explore!). David was a great communicator and was available when I popped upstairs to ask a question. Desmo is a sweetheart as well. We loved the extra touches including the Nespresso machine (which we sadly didn't have time to take advantage of) and the cozy robes. I would highly recommend staying with David.

1587410,182081398,2017-08-13,108353344,Adam,Lovely spacious apartment with endless transport options for seeing the city. Mission has quite the buzz about it. Some parts are rather rough around the edges but in amongst there are some fabulous restaurants cool coffee shops and fancy boutiques. There really is a bit of everything here.
1578597,19472779,2014-09-13,18838926,Anabel,Nice studio with good views of the city and waterfront. Easy check-in the bed is comfortable and the location is good if you enjoy hiking your way through the city (I do). There seem to be good transport links nearby though although I didn't make use of them. Restaurants and a WholeFoods with a coffee shop within walking distance. 
585326,7546907,2013-09-24,4890600,Ole,The apartment is nice and clean. We loved to have a kitchen to prepare our own breakfast. You get a pincode for den entrance. So you are really flexible with the check-in. To get to the city center takes a while but you get buses easily. Unfortunately we met Linda just before leaving the flat. She seemed to be very nice. 
997382,7633891,2013-09-27,7086513,Andreas,Beautiful house in a great neighborhood.  The room was really small as advertised and suited my needs perfectly well. Would come back anytime thanks a lot!!!

191632,637875,2011-10-17,1037096,Jennifer,"I almost didn't see Maria but she was nice and helpful about leaving my stuff at the place before check-in time. Nice place with your own key and entrance. The bed although is a pull-out couch was very comfortable. 

The only thing I would say it's that the apartment has big windows with no curtains leading to their backyard so if they are there they can see you in the room. I didn't happen to me but it gives you a little less privacy.

Well located. Just one bus for downtown. Really close walking distance to Golden Gate Park and Haight-Ashbury."
12270048,121148264,2016-12-14,23679589,Dan,Krystyna's place was spotless spacious comfortable and conveniently located. She and her partner were excellent with communication and went out of their way to make my stay a happy and comfortable one. I'd absolutely stay here again!
9187534,167422726,2017-07-06,6825548,Kristine,Our family of 4 adults & 3 kids had a wonderful stay at Audry and Fran's place. Their beautiful Victorian house was clean comfortable and had everything we needed. Audry was there to greet us when we checked in and she was super helpful throughout our stay. The location is great with a park/playground nearby as well as really good shops and restaurants in the very charming neighborhood. Would highly recommend this place for an authentic SF experience and will definitely be back!
10943827,405863476,2019-01-27,151924532,Alex,Michaele and Andy’s home was cozy and perfect spot to explore San Francisco! It included all of the comforts of home; comfy bed amazing shower laundry (if needed) and was very clean and cozy thru-out. The neighborhood was adorable and felt like a San Franciscan...great long weekend stay and hope to come back soon!

Their place is exactly like the pictures very clean very nice very comfortable and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom and sink area was super clean. She provides toiletries including toothpaste shampoo soap etc. It's also very well located in the middle of everything and with a lovely Cafe shop across the street. 

If I am ever up in San Francisco again I'll be looking to stay here again."

728585,31513931,2015-05-06,26987525,Nathalie,Unser Aufenthalt im Clipper Street Cottage in San Francisco war klasse! Wir d.h. Mein Mann und ich haben insgesamt 3 Nächte im Clipper Street Cottage verbracht und würden jederzeit wiederkommen! Das cottage ist sehr gepflegt stilvoll eingerichtet und sehr sauber! Es ist für alles gesorgt: ausreichend Handtücher schampoo Duschgel Kaffee Tee... sogar frisches Obst stand bei der Ankunft bereit! Das Stadtzentrum erreicht man von der clipper Street aus bequem per Bus und Straßenbahn! Das Wohngebiet ist recht ruhig die nächsten Geschäfte Cafés und Restaurants sind nicht weit auf der 24th ave zu finden! Doug war ein großartiger Gastgeber sehr freundlich und um unser Wohl bemüht! Wir kommen gerne wieder!

I would definitely stay here again on my SF adventures and highly recommend booking if you're considering a trip to SF.
3780418,339679017,2018-10-21,9835484,Kristine,The rental was beautifully appointed super clean and close to everything.  I really appreciated the stocked fridge - a real plus!  The bed was very comfortable and there were 4 pillows - I was able to pick the one that worked best for me.  So important for a good night rest.  There were bus stops nearby and the BART train station was about a 10 minute walk.   I used Lyft shared ride a lot during my stay and my total Lyft cost was reasonable since the rental is close to everything!  This is a great place for your stay in San Francisco!

21011508,258846746,2018-04-29,30715919,Andrea,Place is even better than the photos!! There was plenty of space for 2 adults and our toddler. More room if needed for larger family. Family lives above the place but has its own private entrance and they were so sweet. Left us welcome wine fruit chocolate and coffee! And the back yard area is so cute and spacious. Perfect for our little one to run around. They even built a normal size crib for us. Highly recommend!

We had an early flight in and he let us store our luggage until the normal check in time which helped out a lot. The house is in a great location near restaurants bars and grocery stores. The transit was easily accessible and close as well. We really enjoyed our visit! Brain is super helpful and very humble. The only thing that we wish we had known about were the downstairs neighbors. Our room was above or very close to their living room. We had a super early AM flight back and we could hear them talking and laughing most of the night. Other than that it was a fantastic place to stay! 
431632,11024218,2014-03-17,12727696,Wilson,We had a wonderful time staying at Lindsay and Brian's wonderful apartment!

4227441,112916564,2016-11-08,73979170,James,Had a great stay here for a weekend city break. Nice quite neighbourhood. Having your own personal entrance and bathroom is a really bonus. Clean tidy and easily accessible for public transport. Communication was excellent including directions for that and public transport which was greatly appreciated. I would definitely recommend this to be at the top of your list for AirBnB places to stay in SF.
9225,486513262,2019-07-12,72619447,Kristal,This is a truly unique experience! We would have been closer in to downtown if we were more aware but this was just fine. I highly recommend walking to Plow for breakfast their grapefruit  mimosas are the bomb! Also be aware almost everything on the menu is large enough to share!
69410,860644,2012-01-13,1456236,Julia,Patrick's place was very pleasant and comfortable. Patrick was very friendly and always willing to help. His place is in a nice neighbourhood very close to the Golden Gate Park. Lots of interesting things to see there!
11345707,131771255,2017-02-13,91580030,Kimberly,"The Cottage was perfect for my 3 night solo getaway. Apon arrival Michael greeted me showed me around the cottage and pointed me in the right direction to all the best eatries in the area. Glen Park has a cute little village of restaurants a bar and a healthy super market a very short walking distance away. Michael also helped me figure out the BART system and drew me a quick map which was very helpful. 

The Cottage is a 20 minute Uber ride from SFO or about 30 minutes via the BART. The Cottage is also close to all tourist attractions. Locations like Fishermans Warf Union Square Alamo Square Park The Golden Gate Bridge etc. All range from 10 to 30 minutes away. Or if you want to take the long way and sightsee which I enjoyed you can walk about 2 hours away to each of those locations and enjoy all the scenery on the way.

After my long days of walking up steep hills and being in the noisy city the Cottage was the perfect tranquility to come back to. The patio was perfect to unwind with a glass of wine and the bed was so comfortable I enjoyed being able to sleep in. (Also there's cool art on the walls to appreciate if you're artsy).

Over all I was very pleased with my first Airbnb experience. The location was safe and Michael and Matt were great hosts! I look forward to staying at The Cottage next time I'm in SF."

Patrick was kind and available.
The neighborhood was perfect with a market just next block.

The only regret is the space the place was little bit small for three people especially for eating. But we don't stay a lot at home so it wasn't really an issue."

She even made a cute welcome sign on the door with my name on it. The space is very clean. I really enjoyed that the apartment is downstairs and as guests we could easily come and go. The bed is very comfortable and has wonderful linens ample towels soap and beverages. And we could connect our Netflix account to the tv which was great. Lastly I enjoyed that the bedroom and living/dining area were separate. Overall a great experience and highly recommend if you’re looking to jump around different areas of San Francisco.

Communicating with Bruce was fast and easy. Such a kind & friendly host! He was willing to come and show us how to use the speakers when we couldn’t figure it out but regardless did not invade our privacy one bit. I appreciate his hospitality very much. The views from this home were phenomenal from both the deck and master bedroom. The backyard was very big and spacious and the inside of the home was as comforting and accommodating for a big group of people. I will definitely be booking this home again if I’m looking to stay in SF!!
1470340,99703411,2016-09-05,89725297,Jory,Gustav was excellent as it pertains to communication and our stay was enjoyable. Everything in the description is accurate including there being a good amount of street parking (which was big for us considering we drove into the city). The unit was extremely clean and well kept.

26565582,341759355,2018-10-27,153875,Caterina,We had a fantastic stay in Dagmar's house. First of all this is probably the cleanest place we've been to so far: just spotless and very tidy. The house itself is beautiful and provides lots of space (the kitchen and living room are very big). Dagmar decorated it in a unique way: the place has a lot per personal character. It was fully equipped with everything including food and drinks for us in he fridge. The location is perfect: so close to restaurants shops and Dolores Park. Dagmar has been a wonderful host since the first communication: she waited for us at our arrival checked on us during our stay and even left us a basket full of breakfast treats on the day we were leaving. We loved staying here.

4135201,69045076,2016-04-08,63942883,John,"David was extremely friendly and accommodating during my stay. I lived in Dave's guest room for 5-6 days while I waited for my belongs to arrive at my new SF apartment. Not only does he have a beautiful clean and state of the art apartment but David also went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed (shampoo towel etc.).
David is also very personable and happy to strike up a conversation to make you feel at home. Did I mention that his dog Junebug is incredibly cute and friendly?
A few things I really enjoyed:
Comfortable bed
Beautiful neighborhood
Washer and drier
Clean bathroom
Fast internet
Large room"
15383658,320355757,2018-09-08,6444543,Ana,The room was perfect very comfortable and clean and the bathroom was ok too always clean and tidy. We didn’t like that much the neighborhood as it wasn’t “the cool” part of the Mission but it was walking distance (10 minutes) of the nice coffee shops and restaurants so it wasn’t that bad. On the other hand Rob and his wife were super nice and we felt very welcomed.
27427727,526968245,2019-09-09,52983213,Paul,"Natalie’s apartment is absolutely beautiful. Set slightly out of the tourist hotspots it was a perfect quiet retreat in an evening. 
Natalie was really helpful in all her communications leading to our stay and provided us with a great book with recommendations of things to see and places to eat which was really helpful.
The only sad thing was that she was out of town during our stay so we couldn’t express our gratitude in person"

The couch/bed is very comfy the walk-in closet is huge (by California standards) and the bathroom is very bright. I loved the hardwood floors and well-stocked kitchenette being able to walk to the beach in a few minutes the great restaurants and coffee shops nearby and the quiet backyard.

They showed me the area near by took me out for drinks and Duncan even lend me his bike which led to an unforgettable trip around San Francisco. The hostel itself is very clean and the atmosphere is very relaxed and overall 'cool'. So if you're traveling alone or even with someone - this is your best bet.

7841744,477111709,2019-06-27,57062187,Jspflorida,You will feel like a San Francisco Native during your stay in this wonderful original neighborhood just six blocks north of Gold Gate Park.  This early 20th century home is very authentic and charming.  The home was spacious and  felt open with its many windows. Our stay included use of the homes garage which was really convenient.  We had a late model Toyota Camry which just fit in due to the garage´s narrow door.  Folding the car´s mirrors gave an additional margin of safety.   Within walking distance are many restaurants cafes and public transportation.

I loved the location - one block from a muni and the Main Street full of shops.  West Portal is a great neighborhood!  I highly recommend this Airbnb.
23613300,353606138,2018-11-28,28759574,Duong,Communicative and accommodating hosts clean living space convenient location where there are no hotels.

32823963,520596574,2019-08-30,52888313,Karen,This is a well placed AirBnb for San Francisco sightseeing.  Michelle is quick to respond and thorough with information.  I would use this again.

3727061,101220907,2016-09-12,67274763,Mickey,"My family had a wonderful time here. Tim and his family were great hosts! Tim gave us a nice intro to the apt. and neighborhood including great recommendations for local food & drink.

This is a great place for families. We traveled with our 18mo old son and had plenty of room for us plus my in-laws. The kitchen/living space is large - great for preparing meals and hanging out. The dining room comfortably accommodated 7 of us. The garage has a narrow entryway but the off-street parking is a real plus!

I can highly recommend this place - again especially for families - as it is clean comfortable and the owners are super-nice and made us feel very welcome."
585225,57399864,2015-12-25,5524287,Susie,"We had a mixed experience here. The space was small but cozy and we had what we needed for a simple stay in the city.

Unfortunately due to a miscommunication between the host and the cleaning service the place was dirty when we arrived at check in.  So we weren't able to check in until two hours later which was inconvenient.  The cleaning service apologized and gave us a few beers to make up for the problem.  

It's a cute studio that was great for our quick two day stay. "
4069838,60350572,2016-01-22,48204622,Jessica,It's located in the outer mission which is a little far from the city but only a 15 to 20 minute drive from other sectors. The home was clean and beautiful with tons of books and amenities more than you can expect from any hotel. The backyard was really lovely with a hammock hanging on the side and a lemon tree. I took a half hour nap on that hammock at one point. Overall I felt as though the hosts really thought it through on how-to provide the most comfortable living experience for their guests and it was really appreciated.

Mission is an interesting part of San Francisco and a good point from which visiting the different parts of town."
5788099,132927770,2017-02-19,38796460,Mike And Lori,"Beautiful spacious townhouse with spectacular views that couldn't be beat! Robyn was very accommodating letting us drop our luggage at 11am the morning of arrival even though she had a previous renter who just checked out at 10am. She showed us around and gave us thorough instructions on how to use everything so we had no questions during our stay. We came back at 3pm and the house was immaculate. Robyn also gave us a late check out at 1pm the day we left since our flight wasn't until 430pm.
There was a high end Nespresso machine with pods to use for an early morning wake up. Robyn also offered anything to eat or drink there (including cereals snacks food in the fridge/freezer water wine beer and spirits). 
We got around by walking and we also used Uber for longer trips or if weather was bad. Most of our Uber trips were around $7-13 around town. We would definitely love to stay here again next time we're in town and highly recommend Robyn's place to anyone else coming to the San Francisco area. "
2742151,38265181,2015-07-14,28224719,Rafael,"Stacie could not have been more accommodating to myself and my family. When we arrived she gave us a tour of her massive yet humble abode introduced us to her very friendly cat Liao and gave us some lovely food and neighborhood advice. Stacie's home was clean cozy and smelled great because of the flowers she had spread around the house. It felt like home away from home.

The flat is no more than 15 minutes away from anything and everything in San Francisco. And just a short walk to Haight-Ashbury Golden Gate Park The Fillmore USF Campus and a number of amazing restaurants.

The ad is very accurate the host is AMAZING and I will be back any time I visit San Francisco!"
17606766,166209102,2017-07-03,87867385,Wil,Great place for groups of  4-8. Walking distance from the beach and plenty of restaurants.
2026910,23362501,2014-11-30,10573110,Lloyd,"Bree's beautifully renovated three bedroom home is perfectly situated on a quiet street in the NOPA area of San Francisco which is central and easy to get anywhere from.  There are lots of great shops restaurants and coffee spots just minutes away.  Golden Gate park is around the corner with museums and gardens and bike paths etc.
But you won't want to leave this wonderful oasis...bright and sunny and very stylish...and sooo comfortable.  There are beautiful linens comfy beds and a well appointed wonderful open kitchen.  Even a beautiful fireplace that makes morning coffee and evenings so cosy and relaxing. 
Bree is extremely helpful and communicative and even brings in some local treats and fresh flowers for her guests before arrival.  
Our family spent Thanksgiving week at this awesome home and could not have had a better time!

10193457,170441604,2017-07-15,12472211,Lisa,"Thanks for hosting us! Check in to the suite was super easy and convenient. The listing was a bit smaller than I'd thought it was going to be but that was mainly because we had to use the air mattress as well as the bed so it took up much of the living area. Not a big deal.

We had a lovely stay and while we could definitely hear the host family upstairs it wasn't too big of a deal."
2047469,143604868,2017-04-12,116478074,Shawn,Everything was fantastic!  Kenix is a very generous host.  Our stay was quite comfortable and relaxing.  Beautiful room and living area!

51773,2654054,2012-10-19,2988189,Elizabeth,This room was exactly as described and Jay was a kind host. The room was clean comfortable and quiet the perfect place to get a good night's sleep after long days of sightseeing in the city. The clean bathroom was always free when I needed to use it. I had space in the fridge to put my food and was able to cook eggs for breakfast each morning. It was also nice to have wireless internet. Jay was always available to answer any questions whether in person or by phone. The location was wonderful and I would definitely stay at Jay's again!
19904931,193490903,2017-09-13,60092080,V. Noah,Dylan's place is small but located in a great neighborhood. Check-in is easy and entrance/exit is not through a common space eg you have your own entry. However the unit could use a good cleaning and removal of non-essential items possibly a new shower unit. There is also not an independent deadbolt or latch on the exterior door meaning anyone with the keys could access the unit while the guest is inside. Finally expect some early morning (eg 5AM) noise: the unit abuts a corridor which is either used for trash or recycling so there is a good amount of audible rumbling.
2387068,34058589,2015-06-04,3382903,Hee Jung,Her house is very clean and nice. Bed was very comfortable and I even didn't want to come out. Decoration is just like the picture. Her townhouse is beautifully decorated. Peg is very nice and kind and she even gave me a ride to the airport on the last day of my stay. Her new dog Niki she is also very friendly and lovely. I would definitely recommend this room to stay if you go to San Francisco. 
909063,27528348,2015-03-07,22733777,Xiao'An,Rafael and Mark were incredibly welcoming and the room was beautiful. I very much enjoyed the experience and hope to stay here again if possible when I next return to San Francisco.

4902063,138832455,2017-03-21,15732309,Giustarini,Very central. Clean. Very well organized for check in and out.
216064,181008513,2017-08-12,11615696,Jenny,I never met the host although he seemed nice enough.  We did not end up staying the night.  As noted the area is very residential and parking is difficult especially when arriving late in the evening.  When we arrived the host was not there which was unexpected.  I ran into another guest right outside the house who had the host on the phone and he informed me that the house was unlocked and we could go right in which was unexpected.  When we went inside the house was very quiet and a typical older house in San Francisco.  It was not dirty per-se but it did not appear as though the room and bathroom had been thoroughly cleaned before we arrived.  Our bed did not appear to actually be a queen as advertised and was too small for two adults to sleep comfortably (unless cuddling).  I was not able to connect to wifi and the host left no instructions.  The main reason we left was because we did not feel secure in the house.  Neither the front door nor the bedroom door would latch such that the door could still be pulled open even when the handle was locked.  This made the bedroom door lock completely useless.  Another guest and I were able to shove the front door closed hard enough to get the deadbolt in but we were concerned that we would not be able to properly secure it from the outside if we or another guest left the house.  We did not bring any sort of locks for our luggage and did not want to risk our belongings being stolen because the doors would not lock properly and there were apparently other guests staying in the house.
7348398,71687267,2016-04-27,14127912,Jessica,"Mike and Joann were exceptional hosts! The rooms were very nice - clean and quiet + the view from the sitting room was amazing. The location is perfect we fell in love with castro the moment we got there. It is easy to go anywhere and Mike was very helpful and gave us lots of tips. 

It was a great trip and we can't wait to go back to San Francisco!"

209514,498984245,2019-07-30,256242558,Kreshonda,This place is definitely centrally located!!! Although parking is very challenging to find you can use UBER OR LYFT (Select carpool) to get you to Chinatown Fisherman's Wharf Nd to other places for cheap prices. Room 2 is my favorite!!! Be sure to open the curtains of the bay windows for the beautiful view. If your room gets a little chilly just use the heater which is installed in the fireplace. Enjoy San Francisco!!
992676,27239780,2015-02-28,22764280,Ashley,I really enjoyed my stay at Kate's house! Very clean comfortable and home-y :) Even though I only stayed for one night it would have been a great place to stay longer. Having a kuerig coffee maker in the suite was great as I was on a long road trip and was tired so that was great! Thank you Kate!  
21790309,525397455,2019-09-07,267351819,Katya,I stayed in Alice's apartment for a couple of nights on a work trip. It was a very comfortable and relaxing experience - Alice made all of the check-in/check-out logistics very easy and went out of her way to be available .

7247746,101672454,2016-09-14,81260845,Matt,Perfect location for the park and the beach and a quick drive into the city. I had no issues parking in the street but it was helpful that my rental car was a compact.  There are 3 total rooms for rent all in the same hallway. I actually never saw the other guests but i could hear my neighbor on business calls. That didn't bother me a bit but to each his own. Very clean perfectly described room and Roger was easy to get a hold of for information prior to checking in.   
20424542,415083771,2019-02-21,12071913,Paul,The flat is ideally located in a quiet and attractive suburb approx 5 minutes walk from bus & metro (muni) stops. It proved a perfect base for exploring downtown  Golden Gate Park & the Golden Gate Bridge. Our host Michael was very responsive & helpful and gave us the best tip we received during our stay - the $6.75 ferry trip to Sausalito (one way) which provided wonderful views of the bridges and Alcatraz. Ask Michael to help if you need a safe place to leave your luggage on the day of departure.
13652971,461006533,2019-05-30,2145319,Jess,David's spot was awesome--super clean room very comfortable bed with nice mattress linens plenty of charging spots and clean minimalist look and David was super friendly and full of great advice. Location is ideal. Would def stay again!

774323,23106192,2014-11-23,58650,Deb,Jan is a great host with deep knowledge of the city. We felt welcome in her home during our 3-day stay and our room and bath were as described: comfortable private and quiet. Queen bed was quite comfy. Location is great in the heart of the Mission District (easy walking to all the best spots) plus there's quick access to public transportation just a couple of blocks away.
17965243,514745486,2019-08-21,171922215,Steve,I am confident you will enjoy Gene’s place. We loved the quiet beach town location. The private parking spot was great. Secure access quiet neighbors amazing style so many thoughtful touches open floor plan bright and light the list goes on. Every time I wanted something it was right there. Like the luggage stand in the closet or the Kleenex next to the couch. Just really well-appointed to make you comfortable. Location was great for going to the Wharf Presidio and GG park. We wanted to stay longer.

2178509,11223936,2014-03-25,10339956,Paul,"A Great Place to Stay.  It doesn't get much better than this.  

My daughter lives in the Glen Park area of San Francisco.  She  her husband and a new baby rent a small apartment.  Before the baby was born I always stayed with them when visiting.  Now with very limited space I needed a close-by place to stay.  There are no nearby hotels.  I had heard of Airbnb but had never used it.  Now was the time to try it.

I reviewed many listings.  Gregg's place was only 2 blocks away.  I decided to stay for 4 nights.

What a great experience.  The room was immaculate bright and beautifully decorated.  The double bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was close-by.  Gregg was welcoming helpful and just a pleasant nice guy.  I had a great visit.  The experience was all pros and no cons.  I am now an Airbnb fan."
64165,873848,2012-01-20,1241902,Nicholas,"My stay with Regina was fantastic.  Her place is in a wonderful location the apartment is very comfortable and clean and Regina is a spectacular host.  She was extremely friendly but also respectful of my need to get some work done.  

Coordinating this place couldn't have been easier.  She was very quick to respond to my initial request and within 3 hours I was comfortably in the apartment.  

I would definitely stay here again and will send friends looking for a comfortable apartment in a great location at a reasonable price."

We had a warm welcome of Natalie who is a great cook : she prepared for us a delicious recipe (a slow cooked pork with buns). 
Thanks Natalie and Paige."

Property itself is located close to public transport with only one small hill between the Castro and the house (5ish minute walk). Heaps of nightclubs bars and restaurants within walking distance. Property is well decorated and offers everything you may need to self-cater and entertain.

We would absolutely recommend this property! Thanks again for making our San Francisco trip so memorable."

Having a couple of umbrellas available (wet weather on one day sadly) was an extra touch that was appreciated.  Noom was very quick to come back to us when required and helpful with information that assisted us on our visit to San Fransisco.  Thanks for also storing our bags after check out.
442397,161325222,2017-06-17,120261575,Neha,We had such a wonderful time staying here! Marianne is a perfect hostess. We were welcomed personally and she was so warm and friendly. Inside the rental it was clear that Marianne had truly gone to great lengths to make this a home away from home for her guests. The kitchen is well equipped there are plenty of toiletries the garage parking is a HUGE plus in the city and Marianne was quick to respond to any texts we sent with questions. We were all very comfortable for our one week stay. The home itself is in Outer Sunset -- very close to the beach and public transportation that will take you straight downtown. We cannot say enough good things about Marianne!
4106442,27352901,2015-03-02,484255,Brian,The apartment is very well located near 24th St and BART with a lovely patio out back. Samantha provided some delicious bread and cheese on arrival and was happy to answer any questions I had. A lovely experience in the best neighborhood in SF!

350391,41976417,2015-08-10,36303799,Mimi,"Jim & Jeff were extremely welcoming & generous with their time advice & hospitality. Their home is stunning & the accommodation very plush the location was perfect (lots of parking if you have a car & great neighbourhood... SO quiet at night)... The best part is THE VIEW!  I don't think you could pick anywhere  better to experience SF!  A sunny rooftop with deck chairs to soak it all in... absolutely dreamy! 

It is just a $12-20 max Uber into the centre of town or to any of the absolutely delicious restaurants in this beautiful city.  Hands down I think the only place to base yourself for a true SF experience. "

3124541,196315748,2017-09-22,44805040,Rique,"Yuca is an excellent host! 

He's professional hospitable friendly and  thought of everything in advance to make the visit as comfortable as possible. His on-suite unit is very clean and comfortable and as close to its description as can be. It was the ideal location for me as having formerly lived nearby years ago. Street parking was ideal as well. The bed was very comfortable as was the bathroom and shower. The room was also very spacious and his private entrance was a nice feature albeit through the garage. I didn't use the patio but it did look quaint and comfortable. Best of all he was super cool and friendly and made me feel comfortable and welcomed! I would certainly stay with Yuca again!

Truly

Nous avions une chambre spacieuse avec terrasse privée + salle de bain privée. 
Hyper bien placé à seulement 10 - 15 min à pied de l’entrée de Castro (en haut d’une rue bien raide) !
Et à proximité des rues du Haighs + entrée du Golden Park. 
Idéal pour rayonner dans SF en seulement 3 jours. 

Nous avons été accueillis par Albert très sympa et de bons conseils sur l’organisation des visites + restaurants. 

A noter il y a un chien dans la maison mais il est très sympa et pas bruyant. 

Logement à recommander."

6360976,35312736,2015-06-17,15394048,Hernan,La casa es espectacular de las tipicas casas de San Francisco que uno ven en las peliculas con dos dormitorios la ventana saliendo sobre la calle y muy bien mantenida en un barrio muy lindo a dos cuadras de Lombard Street close to Polk St Fishereman Wharf y el resto de las atracciones. Muy comoda para moverse. Solamente teneer en cuenta que queda sobre una alta colina con lo que el regreso a veces puede resultar un poco cansador pero en esos casos se resuelve con un taxi por unos $5 o $6. 
14763705,286232200,2018-07-05,129450290,Marianne,Vi hadde ett fint opphold i SF. Veldig praktisk med mulighet for å parkere bil samt vaskemaskin. Enkel og fin kommunikasjon med Joe.

6494663,55915914,2015-12-07,47047455,Kendra,I am a first time AirBnB user but I think Pauls place was great!!just as pictured... Shower was large and beautiful and he had several tips to having a great experience (food place suggestions hangout spots etc.) I never got to meet him because we were always out and about but the thing I liked most was the clear communication. Everything down to the shower heads was labeled and directions were clear. Even tho I didn't meet him anything I had a question about was answered. I really enjoyed it and Would recommend this place to anyone !!

9225,69253975,2016-04-10,59947198,Bob,Gae's place is amazing. It is an art museum in the middle of the block on Vermont. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the tour of the house. Very clean and comfortable and no trouble with parking at all. We will stay here again and recommend this to friends.

351881,112052838,2016-11-03,5444482,Matze,Katie and Chris are very welcoming in their beautiful home. Biggie Smalls the little dog greeted us whenever we came out of our room. We really enjoyed our stay here. It's in a great part of town and it's easy to get around from there.
29797894,438091680,2019-04-15,95954754,Eric,Exactly what was promised the space was great. The location was perfect for our needs. Collin was a fantastic host. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.

1069167,536458364,2019-09-26,10497195,Elspeth,This place was clean stylish and cozy. The pour over cover and records made for wonderful mornings. We were close to transit and some cute neighbourhood spots which we found through Jenifer and Bob’s guidebook! Jenifer was super responsive and helpful and Bob was kind and friendly when we checked in and out. Thanks for having us to you both!
4439461,416622549,2019-02-24,32414177,Anne-Marie Refsgaard,Great place and neighborhood to stay. Jeffery is a fantastic host and so helpful. I will recommend this place to anyone going to SF.
8597021,50566861,2015-10-12,21365316,David,Our host was available at all times for us to reach if we had any questions! The place was amazing and exactly what the picture described. The location was great (less than a mile away from the BART). And James allowed us drop off our bags before the requested check-in times so we could travel without any heavy luggage. Would definitely stay at James lovely home again!
18898768,409380309,2019-02-07,83707168,Katy,Molly's place is impecable! Beautiful bathroom great Japanese toilet amazingly comfortable bed and linens and on top of it all you get fruit and a fresh baked delicious scone. I would stay here again over and over!
1620039,19758836,2014-09-17,9430470,Lauren And Jonathan,While I didn't stay in this place I can say that the host has been very helpful. Through a botched booking (completely my fault) Dana has been gracious in working with me to find another booking that will work for the time frame. She's been very responsive and more than accommodating. I have every expectation that her space is just as accommodating. Thanks!
516836,18061934,2014-08-21,17409275,Kristin,We´ve stayed to San Francisco for three nights at Frans home. The house is wonderful and it´s not far away from the center of San Francisco. It was very clean we had a great view from the balcony to San Francisco Downtown. Fran was very friendly and we felt very well at her home.
7715542,215799834,2017-12-01,5785240,Laurent,Great place to stay on POLK street quiet street very close to everything!
491867,31215153,2015-05-03,4581692,Lauren,Had a fantastic time at Sona's place! She was very welcoming and able to show us around on arrival because she happened to be picking up her pet. The house was absolutely beautiful and it was so fun to stay in a classic San Fran victorian. We also enjoyed the back garden with the sunny weather. Location is very central right in Haight and within walking distance to Hayes valley with many places to eat and a market around the corner. 
3081324,163455412,2017-06-24,126182888,Weirong,"We had great time at the house. It's pretty nice clean and comfortable for family/friends to stay. Especially we appreciate the host provided milk/juice bread snacks water and flowers etc. for the first day. So we don't have to go out buy food at the first night. All the amenities are enough for our big group of 9. And they respond to our request very quickly. 
The place can access many bus lines and BART within a few minutes of walk. If you like quiet place then it's better to stay at the inside bedrooms. The couch sleeper area is a little bit noisy from highway."
2956406,26871364,2015-02-21,26165739,Martina,Great place in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking. Simon is a great host.
3280443,329822121,2018-09-29,119640526,Holly,My stay at Catherine’s was a five-star experience. She was a responsive gracious host and her space and location couldn’t have been better!
21082676,356267635,2018-12-07,46017237,Marc,what a great place to stay when you're in San Francisco feel like a local in the lovely Castro neighborhood. Beautiful stylish accommodation and super great hosts. I highly recommend.
1421774,270164273,2018-05-28,61237406,Bracal,"We loved this location and the cleanliness of the space. The location is central and offers a quiet retreat from the crazyiness of San Francisco. 
 
I will add that although the description is very accurate we weren’t prepared with the step up or down into every space. My husbands knees are bad and he was at times uncomfortable. 

In the end we would recommend this place to anyone who asked. 
"
3720392,166881533,2017-07-04,49706866,Victor,This place is great! Location comfortable easy access. 5 stars! 
19954872,422736864,2019-03-11,243959913,Melissa,Nice location. On Sunday mornings there is a great farmer's market right at the corner. Very close to a fantastic restaurant--Burma Superstar--as well.
308885,85834883,2016-07-13,80344830,Penny J,Arbe made us feel welcome.  Believe apartment was not as bright or updated or clean as pictures stated.  Single pane Windows could not stop exterior noise even with earplugs.  Stayed only one night of scheduled five with of course no refund.   Entry to apartment very dirty.  Apartment had old musty smell and garage sale dated furnishings.  Limited towels(three) for 5 night stay and two people. View was okay.  North Beach is a good location but entry to alley apartment had disadvantaged people sitting around it.
6494663,50656650,2015-10-13,9991559,Caterina,Great host. Extremely good quality. Just perfect !!
16018565,200252488,2017-10-04,22913354,Yiqun,"位置非常好在旧金山核心市区离联合广场和闹市区非常近走上十几二十分钟还可以到九曲花径附近房子附近就有一个华丽的大教堂很适合喜欢在城市街道散步的旅行者｡Charles也准备了非常多的攻略和tips让入住的旅行者体验到最方便和本地化的生活｡
Central location in San Francisco city really close to the Union Square and other major shopping malls. Lots of good restaurants and cafes around within walking distance. Best place to stay for those city street view lovers and if you like to walk it’ll only take you less than 30 minutes to the famous Lombard street and the fisherman’s wharf. Charles printed out a lot of tour guidances and tips which are really helpful for travelers to have a genuine SF local life experience!"
11345707,79036485,2016-06-10,22607876,Di,"Michael could not have been more friendly or helpfuland made himself available to us throughout our stay.very good neighbourhood with nice restaurants and all amenities available  also BART station 5 minute walk away.
"
8685766,137175300,2017-03-13,84242106,Brett,Lovely place. I got a queen bed room that seemed pretty large. It's right off the yellow line stop from SFO and the Hyde street trolleys. 
18615032,354979329,2018-12-02,35149173,L.M.,Rudy's place was absolutely a gem. Perfect location and super cost. Would highly recommend!!!
17478285,170513074,2017-07-15,131896583,Alessandro,It s a share house no privacy 
4077186,19658860,2014-09-15,17769990,Alexis,"Danielle is delightful and her space is beautiful! She was friendly and hospitable and super communicative.

Her place is quiet and relaxing well put together with all the amenities you need to be comfortable.

I would absolutely encourage anyone I know to stay in her spacious flat."
15179182,306596577,2018-08-12,177526034,Patricia,We had a great time at Lauren’s place. The binder with local restaurants and establishments was very helpful. The place was clean and well kept and issues were resolved promptly. 
31887808,432398376,2019-04-03,54200858,Sue,Lynn was such a kind and gracious host. All the positive comments other reviewers posted are accurate (space location host). Lynn had the balance of being available but not hovering. Anything we needed or just had a general question about she responded immediately. I would highly recommend this place to others (especially if you're able to reserve the bedroom with the connected private bathroom) as well as consider it for any personal future SF trips.
352165,95523059,2016-08-20,64914334,John,Everything was easy -- the key was waiting when I arrived and the apartment was as described.  The bed was comfortable and the house is just a couple of blocks from restaurants theatre and public transportation.  It is a little bit uphill but only for one block.  The outdoor shower is quirky but I like a breath of fresh air in the morning.  It was all very private.  I didn't use the laundry microwave or fridge but it was all there.
20765941,289619129,2018-07-12,196702112,Ashok,Very clean and neat. Plenty of room. Maggie is an awesome host. Very helpful with lots of info about the area.
23681212,262695195,2018-05-09,181610022,Dima,This place is a great place located in the middle of San Francisco. Michelle was a great host and very quick. The room is Very close to all the shops the touristic areas and the public transportations. Loved our stay there! Thanks Michelle!
1992217,91068068,2016-08-03,68098,Yonas,"Although this place is on a monstrously steep hill the payoff is worth it -- you get unbelievable views of San Francisco. It's conveniently located to both The Castro and The Mission and Muni/BART stations are fairly convenient as well if you need to get to other parts of the city.

Peter was an amazing host. Even though it's not included in the listing he made me breakfast and coffee every morning  throughout the duration of my stay. He has been a longtime resident of San Francisco since the early 1990's so he has some very interesting stories to share as well as some awesome suggestions of things to see/do.

The bedroom is very spacious clean and has a fantastic view of the city. The bed itself is quite comfortable. The bathroom was super clean and totally loaded with supplies. Everything was as it was described and I definitely recommend staying here."
37973490,540938622,2019-10-04,175007833,Gautam,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
30228101,505092719,2019-08-08,278958436,Borche,Yvonne and Tom are amazing! Their place is affordable clean and cozy. They make you feel like your at home. Thank you and I hope to come back again!
1984709,11082994,2014-03-19,1382241,Alex & Marie,awesome experience. best location. unusual spacious san francisco apartment with all new clean amenities. This was one of the best stays. Highly recommended.
16274869,129977602,2017-02-03,12039419,Eliza,A beautiful apartment - clean comfortable with everything you need included. Wonderful communication helped with a super smooth check in and suggestions for the area. An interesting suburb - diverse people. Close to public transport parking available (we had no trouble at all!). Would recommend for small groups or couples. Thanks Ursula - a great apartment and was lovely meeting you on checkout! 
424846,225516268,2018-01-06,6764174,Glory,Martha is an absolutely lovely host. The home is beautiful. Everything is super cozy in a homey comforting way not cozy as in small. The shower has great water pressure. Wonderful kitchen. I love the location cause it’s close to my family and I like the Richmond district  really great food. Bus actually easy around there too and near beach and Presidio hikes. If you are expecting to walk to downtown or the Mission it might not be your spot but it’s a quick ride in a car anywhere. 
12562572,132235155,2017-02-16,11190173,Suzette,This is a great in-law suite. What delighted me was the cleanliness attention to details - loads of amenities breakfast food coffee and teas. For me this was my 2nd Airbnb stay and I was very happy with the accommodations - very comfortable and tastefully decorated. As this was a business trip the location was very accessible to downtown SF.  While I didn't get to meet Brad I was greeted and welcomed by Ray who provided a brief tour and great smile (thank you for making me feel at home). I would highly recommend Brad's place.
18350662,198006919,2017-09-27,111982991,Nick,"Mike's flat is in a great location and is particularly close to a whole host of places on Valencia Street we walked to dinner and drinks each night though Uber in the city is very cheap (compared to Britain) if you want to to further afield. The flat itself is immaculate and well-appointed we couldn't have been happier with it. Just note that two of the queen beds are in one room together not an issue for us but something to be aware of. 

Check in couldn't have been easier and communication was really straightforward Mike is a very friendly and helpful host and the guide he has in the flat was particularly great. 

All in all a fantastic place to stay in San Francisco we really enjoyed it and would happily look to stay there again."
567239,307612403,2018-08-14,187094091,Fei&Ting,Judy and Ed were so nice and warm just like our family. They would chat with us at breakfast time and gave us good suggestions of traveling. There were a Chinese restaurant and a Thai restaurant in a walking distance in their neighborhood. Besides it's very convenient to visit the scenic spots around downtown. Highly recommend:)
16542790,248123156,2018-03-30,3451945,Nicole,Trey's place was perfect for my short stay. The location is quiet but quite close to cafe's markets and restaurants. Trey was an attentive communicator and made it really easy to check in/out.
5144482,36746585,2015-06-30,3285945,Melanie,We had a great stay here! Everything was super clean and with updated amenities. Another reviewer mentioned snakes but I'm pretty sure now that they meant snacks phew!! :) The location is nice and quiet but close to the action a perfect place to crash while visiting SF! Michelle provided great instructions complete with photos but we were a bit confused because I think it said the entrance was on the right side of the house but it is to the left side of the driveway so we wandered around a little at first.
60365,40196741,2015-07-29,27985201,Mikael,Great place in the hipster middle of SF. We love the neighbourhood with MUNI access to downtown and pier areas in minutes. The appartment is spacious very well maintened extremely quite with a nice view over city west. We will come back.
13901641,214382175,2017-11-25,159915409,David,Very quiet neighborhood but with lots of restaurants and public transit within walking distance. Parking on the drive way.
4902565,26183758,2015-02-06,18794490,Riz,I definitely enjoyed my stay! The room was really comfortable. Great location. Very close to union square. And the manager Llyod was so nice! Overall it's a good place to stay. Very recommended :)
18123274,201110460,2017-10-07,147482852,Amanda,It is a great place and Gabriela is easy to deal with and very helpful.
3157541,538381638,2019-09-29,293385247,Annet,It is a big pleasure to stay with Mishi: cozy house you feel very welcome and great location!

Bei Fragen war Leslie immer erreichbar."
21632344,287869815,2018-07-08,36179214,Chanelle,Jean was the perfect host quick to answer any questions. The place is in a residential area with those unique San Fran houses lining every road. An Uber to town cost about $20 and there’s a direct bus service (although that will take longer). The space is small but perfect for what we needed and the laundry was so convenient! The bed is very hard I found it a bit uncomfortable but my partner loved it so that’s just personal preference. Highly recommended place to stay!
32725950,425245588,2019-03-17,109478612,Leocadia,Susheela's place is amazing!  The location can't be beat if you are spending time at UCSF.  The apartment is clean stylish quiet and very comfortable.  I will definitely want to stay there again the next time I'm in San Francisco.
8793569,128312392,2017-01-23,2190781,Elizabeth,This was a lovely room in a cute neighborhood close to many restaurants and parks. Not a far trip to anywhere else in the city. Check-in was simple and though we didn't meet James he made sure we had everything we needed. They graciously let us store our luggage on our last day past checkout  and we met Rossemary who is incredibly kind when we came back.
20093004,182904713,2017-08-15,22226300,Sophie,"Un super accueil. Tout a ete facile et notre hote a ete d une grande disponibilite et attention. Tres bien place pres des commerces. L appartement est chaleurex convivial et decore avec gout. 
Merci !"
7054235,193245650,2017-09-12,69815851,Marlene,Benjamin's place was perfect for me. Quiet and peaceful and right near Ocean Beach which was much bigger and more beautiful than I expected. I wanted privacy and a place to retreat to after busy days spent with family and friends in the San Francisco area. The room was clean and warm with beautiful morning light through the sliding glass doors that open to the back yard. The hosts were warm and friendly and very welcoming and accommodating.
727969,216402935,2017-12-03,4020359,Vishal,Nice place very close to nightlife. Sunny and cosy house with a quaint little garden.
1043282,7604752,2013-09-26,8385196,Javier,John y Rob son unos anfitriones muy agradables y nos han hecho sentir como en nuestra propia casa. La habitación es acogedora y luminosa. La cama grande y confortable. Todo incluido el baño está muy limpio bien cuidado y decorado con mucho gusto. Muy buena localización en pleno barrio de Castro. Ha sido una acertada elección para nuestro viaje.
13128357,343784461,2018-11-01,47059398,Shannon,I had a great stay a Sarah and Pankaj's place. I didn't meet Sarah but Pankaj was very welcoming! My room was very comfortable and the home itself is beautiful with fantastic views. There was some construction going on but I really didn't think much of it - not too noisy or intrusive at all. I would definitely stay again.
22003066,472959677,2019-06-20,37337071,Amanda,"This is very nice space but there is a massive construction effort taking place to the left of the building. The space is located in a townhouse with two units and it's the upstairs unit. Also note that in order to get to the outside patio you have to go through the master and down stairs. It is a shared space with the other unit. I gave my colleague the master and didn't want to walk through her space to get to the patio.
Be sure to (Hidden by Airbnb) Map exactly where this is located. It's just blocks from pretty happening streets but as listed it is in a busy traffic area that overlooks the interstate ramp."
23240184,333050382,2018-10-06,48797148,Grahame,"Loverly clean place to stay no hassle check in. Has bar fridge coffee machine microwave so well set up for stay.
Bus about 150 yrds away on Mission road  goes right to Ferry Plaza takes about 50 mins even a rapid bus can be caught to get to town quicker right the centre of the wharf area.
We enjoyed our stay"

20852099,321629857,2018-09-10,90103286,Brian,Wonderful place to stay. Pretty clean and cozy. The parking was a bit difficult to find. Had to park a block away. Overall great experience.
7068804,443775703,2019-04-26,247060928,Chloe,Even nicer than the photos! A beautiful view out of the windows and the whole family made sure I felt welcome and enjoyed the city as much as possible. Place is very accessible by public transit and close to a trader joes which was handy. Found it especially nice to come back somewhere quiet after a day in the city. Would certainly recommend!
8287266,529315469,2019-09-14,232789960,David,Our 1 week stay was just great. The bistro corner offered everything you may need in this period of time. The location is the best you can get for the amount paid. You have grocery stores bars clubs trams and subway station in walking distance. The neighborhood itself is a safe place with a historic atmosphere. The communication was also very smooth with Alex & Daniel. They even helped us with the delivery of a yearly National Park pass (special thanks for it guys). We’d definitely stay here again. :)

21625713,412103404,2019-02-14,17942550,Shari,Shan's place was great! It was conveniently located within a couple minutes walk to the Muni to downtown as well as a mall with plenty of food options (and a Target store). Cozy clean space with everything you need - including a few snacks and coffee. I would definitely stay at Shan's place again.

16204265,200801680,2017-10-06,4868466,Rebecca,Koncha's place is really nice and comfortable and is decorated in a stylish way with cool furniture and art. The apartment is in a good location with plenty of cafes restaurants and boutiques within a few minutes walk. In the room there is  a folder with loads of recommendations and menus for nearby places to eat. The Mission area is cool with awesome street art diverse people great food and is well connected by public transport. Thanks Koncha and Pokey for having us.

21191232,323495527,2018-09-15,148318751,Judson,Tudo muito limpo e organizado. Idêntico às fotos.
9416254,234713051,2018-02-13,80005245,Hammad,David’s place is in a great location in the twin peaks area in San Francisco which is a nice and quiet neighbourhood. The place itself was everything I expected. The first Airbnb I have stayed at that has a functioning coffee machine a small touch but it didn’t go unnoticed. Highly recommended if you’re stopping through SF.
21219237,431324641,2019-03-31,17705844,Patrick,"A great place to stay to explore San Francisco and the Bay area. Conveniently located near the BART and Muni stations in a safe neighborhood. 

The place itself is clean and has a good bed. Coffee and tea provided as are bathroom amenities. Also liked the books provided by Grace.

Best part is the garden which is really nice on sunny days.

Would stay again!"
2274353,457286881,2019-05-23,37270184,Edna,A quiet place with lots of kitchen space 2 comfortable bedrooms up-to-date bathroom and an excellent list of do's & don'ts day trip & restaurant suggestions.
3319447,447492501,2019-05-03,3707354,Erin,Anna's place was perfectly comfy and cozy for a short work trip.  What was a totally unexpected and wonderful surprise was the garden that was right outside the apartment providing both a beautiful view of birds and flowers and tranquility.  I always deeply appreciate an outdoor space because I like to put my feet on the ground when I am traveling in in cities.  Anna had everything a traveler would need-ironing board hair dryer electric kettle tea snacks.  Great water pressure in the shower.  Lovely view from the couch and great light.
14773204,176830185,2017-07-31,7600775,Troy,This was a great spot close to everything and very clean. Very nice bathroom with dual shower heads! It even had a white noise machine that had me out immediately once I hit the bed. Highly recommend.
754117,4783863,2013-05-26,5013523,Patrik,"We had a really wonderful time in San Francisco and this amazing apartment. The flat was very clean modern furnished and it's even better than you can imagine on the pictures.
Really a great place to be in an interesting district.

8051735,60863838,2016-01-28,45317824,Piyush,The place was nice and comfortable.   The rooms were nicely done and the bedding and linen was great.   Also for one of the bedrooms  you have to pass through another bedroom to go anywhere.  One bathroom is a problem though to try and schedule between people.   Neighborhood was fine access to Ocean is nice.
17222332,307145553,2018-08-13,190049639,Jack,I stayed at Kagan's place for about 2.5 months while working in the FiDi. The commute on the bus (14) was an easy commute straight to work. Kagan was very kind and friendly and easy to get a hold of. Although it is a high price for the location I was satisfied. If you do not want a long commute to the city I would recommend looking somewhere closer to the city. Overall I had a good stay at Kagan's this summer. 
26718900,301788808,2018-08-04,205352047,Eric,"Great hidden little gem !
Lazar and Elisa were very knowledgeable about the area
I have a full size truck so I really appreciated the easy street parking and great location. 
Thank you Lazar and Elisa for being great host"
581216,2483729,2012-10-02,1931724,Samuel,"Cathie's flat location is perfect for morning exercise walks to the beach shops food/ drugstore restaurants. Convenient to public transportation and easy access to  everywhere with rare parking available. Very clean and spacious quiet bedrooms nice kitchen dinning rm and office/ living rm to entertain. Only drawback is one bathroom.
Cathie discuss her appointments/schedule of the Pilates class in her front parlor and  i even took one educational Pilates session and it work well for me or anyone who is touring SF during the day and will not be napping during the afternoon. There is no TV cable but wifi available. I lock myself out of the apt in the laundry area with no keyscell phone or warm clothes at 10 pm and lucky for me that Cathie was home downstairs in her studio 
to open the door.... Very lucky break for me."

212783,804118,2011-12-24,1476549,Son,"I had a great experience staying in Room 1 at Josh's place. We had 4 people and the room was perfect for us. It has a queen size bed and a double one. The house is old but I could see that Josh tried to make it as nice as possible for the guests to stay there. 
- Location: right next to Golden Gate Park which has many touristic sites such as California Academy of Sciences Japanese Tea Garden Dutch Windmill etc.; the bus stop is only 2 blocks away and it can take us to downtown in about 20 minutes which is awesome. There are also many restaurants and shops on Haight Street so it's really interesting for us to explore the area
- Host: Josh is really nice. He provides free water bottles and cookies for us. He's very good at replying to texts or emails quickly so I had no problem with communicating with him.
- Room: The room is clean and spacious"

11605954,130110341,2017-02-04,90410629,Diego,We enjoyed staying here for many reasons. The kitchen was very well equipped the rooms were spacious and the house is close to ocean Ave which has shops restaurants and a great gym. The view from the living room is very pleasing. The one and only challenge especially when staying here long-term is the lack of washer and dryer. No big deal at all but we had to find a coin laundry to do laundry which is not the easiest when you're on a work trip. All in all wonderful place! 
22396902,360785543,2018-12-21,50955169,Durba,Brian & Stephen were extremely kind and welcoming. Had a wonderful stay!

Aside from the wonderful patio the room was lovely and bed was comfortable. Martina left us lots of amenities like coffee tea and even a few beers! 10/10 would book again.

840986,86323527,2016-07-16,61439184,Yassine,"An absolutely lovely apartment. We loved the area of Bernal Heights that the apartment is located. There is a great bunch of eateries and bars nearby as well as local amenities. The apartment is very near the Mission area which was absolutely amazing to explore.

Addy and Carlota have a great blog that give great local recommendations as well as things to do in San Francisco.

They were really great with communication and were flexible when we had to check-in early which as tourists we were really appreciative of.

Brilliant!"

562311,50049887,2015-10-08,45771830,Jacqueline,Angie was wonderful! Although we never actually got to meet she was very accommodating to my schedule and flexible during my stay. The place is beautiful--clean funky in a great location and quiet. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat!
20852099,523066557,2019-09-02,163111405,Brittany,Extremely inconsiderate neighbors being loud at 2 A.M and not only couldn't we sleep because of this but we had no fan or A/C accessibility and we were stuffy all night long but Jean was quick to respond when needed her she was a very sweet host.

Uber was super reasonable to all the main attractions. There is even street parking if you bring a car! We felt very at home in our private room balcony and luxurious bathroom. If we needed anything Ronald was there to help. We loved our stay in San Francisco and would definitely recommend to fellow travelers:)
651624,249156213,2018-04-01,5658552,Eben,Thanks Layne for being such a great host!
4069838,291373167,2018-07-15,186307423,Krystina,Ashley's place is a treasure box.  The teen in our group loved exploring every nook and cranny of all the cool things and artwork.  The little kids found plenty of toys to keep them busy: balls crayons etc. Everyone loved spending time in the backyard with the lemon tree and blackberry bushes. The rooms are very comfortable and the bathroom shower pressure was great! Ashley is a very generous host in that her apartment is well stocked with so many different items and open for you to use anything.  The neighborhood is great - walking distance to things you may need and MUNI stops.  Thanks for a wonderful place to stay.. our favorite airbnb yet.
4956697,278307893,2018-06-17,175636892,Christian,"Great place that is central to shops and restaurants. Walking distance to Golden Gate Bridge and Ocean Beach. The house is quite old so consider that when booking .
Host is friendly and hospitable."
9489347,209730845,2017-11-05,38036281,Megan,Rob’s place is in a great location. The neighborhood felt safe and was close to several good restaurants and coffee shops. We walked much of the area but it was also very easy to get an Uber or Lyft if you wanted to venture further out. Rob was quick to respond to my communications and provided many suggestions on what to do/see during our visit. The space was roomy for 2 people and we felt at home with all of the amenities provided. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend!
1206261,9696550,2014-01-05,10920681,Golrokh,We had a nice stay and our host was very friendly and hospitable and easy access to public transit.

1498953,50755936,2015-10-14,41939557,Kathy,  What can I say everything was wonderful the property was beautiful and very well maintained.  Anna is an exceptional hostess providing all pertinent information including a customized list of restaurants in the area which were great!   We highly recommend this very comfortable and tastefully furnished Art Deco home in the established and very unique Ocean district of SF. 
21985129,410142886,2019-02-09,32096302,Lee,perfect.
334339,17930720,2014-08-19,15422601,Lorraine,This was my first experience in not only visiting San Francisco but using Airbnb and I loved it! Bruce Mo & Roxy were the perfect hosts welcoming helpful and friendly while also respecting my privacy. The bedroom and bath were just as clean and fresh as represented in the photos. I never slept so well in a bed not my own! The area is lovely nice and quiet. Walkable if you wish but also extremely accessible via public transportation. Needless to say I highly recommend both Airbnb and Castro Cottage!
2538807,35688878,2015-06-21,1391238,Sue,One of the best location to set up camp in San Francisco - with every corner of the city just a short ride away. The neighborhood is safe and close to many shops and cafes. The suite was clean and perfect. Thanks Phil!
14490262,127248844,2017-01-16,2541618,Amelie,"If San Francisco it's a great city is because peope like Mary lives there.
We went to San Francisco to participate in an art fair the air company lost our luggage and we didn't get it back until the day before leaving. Mary couldn't be so kind and helpful she really helped us a lot.
The house is absolutely fabulous with two big rooms (one is a real suite) a luxury bathroom and a beautiful garden. The kitchen is very well provided for cooking.
If you have the oportunity to stay in this house don't hesitate you will really enjoy it!"
6336315,174107852,2017-07-24,27617437,Julianna,Large clean space with the amenities you need. Much better than a hotel

1110346,153796155,2017-05-21,23830342,Brittany,I spent a week at Stella's home and it was wonderful! Stella is a gracious host her house was very clean and her dog Bruno is very well-behaved. The location was perfect for walking downtown to work. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
29031614,541704857,2019-10-05,85261836,Paul,A fabulous home in a lovely location.  Nice quite area which is within a $10.00 Uber of virtually everywhere.   This home made a fantastic base for our few days in San Francisco and was just what we needed after staying in boat cabins & hotel rooms for the previous 2 weeks!  Highly recommended house and Brenna & Dan are such lovely hosts.
13127954,245545562,2018-03-22,8905175,Fergus,Quiet safe spacious the apartment is. Hosts are very friendly and thoughtful. Highly recommend the host and the apartment.
1989997,28257143,2015-03-21,26043186,Christopher,"I had a wonderful time staying with Michelle and Jeffery. They welcomed me as part of the family and by the end it was as if I had been staying with long lost relatives. 

They were the absolute best people I could have picked to stay with for my first time in San Francisco and I look forward to seeing them again when I next visit in the future. 

All the best for the coming months and I look forward to seeing you both again!

27934189,322631164,2018-09-13,2389112,Victor,This place is the best locations in SF if you want views and walking distance to some of the classic SF restaurants and coffee shops. Farley’s Plow Chez Maman  Pepitos 2 min walk. Immaculate.  Cozy back deck drinking done Farley’s coffee sitting in the sun looking out at downtown. Great communication pleasure to work with. Would be back again anytime.

20059569,342521438,2018-10-28,196585116,Kelli,Great location.  Nice and quiet.  Quick response time.  I’d stay there again.
6970746,52044300,2015-10-26,37186992,Raina,We had a wonderful stay in Laurie and Rebecca's place! The room is just as described very clean and well kept. I loved that they provided soap and shampoo in the bathroom for the guests and their breakfast items were great. Laurie was very helpful and provided yummy breakfast recommendations. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone - it was just what we were looking for!
2944843,418673279,2019-03-02,81766340,Steve,Janaf made my wife and I feel completely at home. Our room and bathroom were impeccably clean. The shower was the best we’ve ever experienced in an Airbnb - excellent water pressure! We weren’t expecting to be served delicious breakfast both mornings and it was a welcome and nice surprise. We could tell Janaf cared about us and our stay. Everything about our stay was easy - from parking to accessing the Muni bus/tram a couple blocks away. You can’t go wrong staying with Janaf!
23257392,537477175,2019-09-28,120012683,Madison,Great place would stay here again!
4183088,307121657,2018-08-13,37174205,Jenna,Tom & Beth’s home was perfectly located a block away from the Painted Ladies and a few more from the Haight and Fillmore Street shops. They had decorated the place with fresh flowers and stocked the fridge with snacks and drinks. They also created this incredibly thorough binder with everything we needed to know about the area and SF as a whole. Definitely highly recommend this Home to anyone. 
6730473,263743131,2018-05-12,111320597,Stephanie,We had a great stay at Karen's apartment. It was much larger than expected and very central to a lot of tourist spots. There are many restaurants and shops nearby and it's close to some Muni stops which made it easy to travel around the city. It's a little far by bus to Fisherman's wharf about 40-50 minutes but if driving by car or Uber it's a quick ride to most spots. Karen was also very easy to communicate with and responded to us quickly. She was able to accomodate us for an early check-in which was so helpful and even offered her driveway to us one night when we had a rental car. The skylights in the room are pretty bright in the morning so if that tends to wake you up I'd definitely recommend bringing an eyemask. As others have mentioned the furniture is a bit worn out and the celing/walls in the apartment are slanted so watch your head. My only complaint about the room is that the king bed was a little uncomfortable and short lengthwise but it's definitely not a dealbreaker. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others looking.
431632,6889451,2013-08-29,3272562,Julien,A great place to discover San Francisco. Walking from the studio to the Golden Gate Bridge the Golden Gate Park or Lands End is really enjoyable. Lindsay and Brian are really nice the studio is clean and well equipped. Don't hesitate !
3759246,512917159,2019-08-18,48363907,Lucas,Cozy spot and we would stay again!
2124182,68975526,2016-04-08,28053696,Lori,Eduardo's cottage is super comfy. The view over the San Francisco downtown skyline is exquisite. He did a great job on their vacation which is modern and stylish and very clean. The location is superlative to downtown San Francisco and the main route out of the city if you want to explore more. I'll be back!
580106,45267044,2015-09-01,37851746,Nicole,Ari was still working when we arrived so she emailed us an easy instruction how to access the property. The property was in a great location and easy to get there by bus. The room was big and bright and we loved the kitchen. Would highly recommend Ari's place to anyone.

It is a very quaint well secured studio home in a wonderful location; easy walk to Golden Gate Park and to shops/food on Geary. Also parking was way easier than any other SF home. A great Air BNB Experience!

De plus il est facile de trouver de la place pour ce garer facilement dans la rue du logement."
18391536,251321852,2018-04-07,7575049,Golnaz,We had a wonderful time with Heather and Pete! They have thought of everything to make the stay as comfortable as possible. They have more amenities than even some of the best hotels we have stayed at. The bed was so comfortable. Everything was super clean. The cool water in the fridge was refreshing. The shower was very hot. Plus the have the most gorgeous friendly dog. Great conversations and a delicious breakfast were the cherries on top. If we ever need to stay in SF this will always be our future place.
15591362,160808921,2017-06-15,27907615,Sandra,This place is better than in the photos. Kris was attentive accommodating and a lovely host. She was available to provide helpful info when needed and also provid privacy to guests. Book this place you'll love it! It was very pet friendly with the garden available to use even though Kris is working on lanscaping.. I am sure it's going to make it even more enjoyable once done. Would definitely recommend to friends and family heading to SF. 
17991554,251321219,2018-04-07,173378152,Jenny,Michelle’s place was very clean and quiet. A great place to stay! Would highly recommend it.
10813277,193759399,2017-09-14,112390325,Antonia,"Staying at Rob's was the BEST AIRBNB EXPERIENCE we ever had! He was the perfect host so welcoming and nice. We had two nice evenings with homemade food and wine: Rob is an excellent cook! 
THE ROOMS give you a really authentic Height/Ashbury experience since Rob put much love into the furniture artworks etc. 
I was completely overwhelmed by THE NEIGHBOURHOOD the houses were incredibly beautiful. 
Getting around is easy since there are buses and trams near and Uber is really cheap in San Francisco.
All in all a wonderful stay!"
2203283,98051273,2016-08-29,17327542,Katherine,Ming was very helpful and communicative she always asked what I needed and was very accommodating with my arrival. Very nice girl

9910056,539591774,2019-10-01,154857440,Lauge,"I stayed in 2 months in Davids apartment while working at UCSF. The unit was clean and has all you need. The neighbourhood is very beautiful quiet and safe. There are brilliant restaurants right around the corner and David provided a book full of all information you may need. It takes 10 minutes to walk to UCSF Mission Bay and 35-50 minutes to walk Downtown. 
David is a nice guy and really helpful. The communication was always fast and precise.
I can really recommend staying in Davids apartment and I will miss life on Potrero hill."
4638266,227723201,2018-01-15,46925051,Marielle,Perfect for our needs in the area. Spotless not at all dusty or any dog hair despite the many tscoshkies and pup! Nina's a cool lady would love to grab a bite to eat with her and hear more about her adventures if we're ever back out in SF of if she's ever back in Baltimore!
720811,47347692,2015-09-18,404501,Patti,This place is in a great location to downtown.  Maybe a 10-15 minute ride to Union Square.  I felt very safe traveling alone in the location.  The house was clean and very comfortable.
25724703,327924376,2018-09-24,52098069,Kate,"Hanni and Dan’s place made us feel very welcomed. We have been to San Fran several times and this was our favorite location by far. Plenty of places nearby to walk to and it felt clean and safe. We loved having an outdoor space too. Visiting with our parents and young daughter we found the place plenty spacious and comfortable. Good to note that the front bedroom doesn’t have a door to it. Not a big deal for us but FYI for future guests. 
Overall the place so perfect with ample children’s toys high chair crib etc. If you’re a family visiting the city this is the perfect place. 
Hanni answered any questions quickly. Great host in an excellent location."

23025299,271941762,2018-06-02,157334075,Bri,Rachel was a great host! The space is clean and comfortable and pretty centrally located 
31072911,475751538,2019-06-24,145821730,Nicolette,This house is so beautiful and the location is great. Parking is safe and convenient! Although it’s technically a shared space we didn’t see the host at all we were given full privacy and it felt as if we were the only ones there.
13789725,303576870,2018-08-07,164811509,Natalie,A beautiful apartment close to the beach luxury very clean. Nice deck terras. We find it to small for 4 adults and their luggage and the wake-up call every morning at 7 is not so fun at your holiday.  Nevertheless we had a good stay! 
1421774,51427741,2015-10-20,33790497,Debby,Easy check-in and check-out. Vanick was great about communicating with us. Good central location with lots of good restaurants nearby. Cozy studio apartment. The kitchen has a microwave toaster oven and hotplate but not a lot in terms of kitchen items to actually cook with or use. 
1333047,560447007,2019-11-06,153850604,Jacqui,Homey space which was perfect for our sfo stay. Love being in the mission. Multiple beds in the loft really suited us and having access to parking was a massive bonus. Would definitely recommend this place.
713877,533489091,2019-09-21,12110611,Peta,Stacey was a great host for our 2 night sojourn in San Francisco.  The apartment was lovely with a great roof terrace overlooking the city.  Everything was extremely well appointed and easy.  Given we arrived in SF well before check in time and left well after our check out time it was great to have a secure space to leave our bags before we had access to the apartment and after we left.  Thank you Stacey!
10550345,421156820,2019-03-08,29351626,Karen,I was unable to complete our stay in this unit.  There was a reservation snafu and the hotel only offered me a room with two double beds which was not what was advertised nor was it suitable for the 3 adults I needed to stay in the unit.
8155586,182077775,2017-08-13,139532574,Shiyun,我们6个人住了两晚房间非常舒服地理位置也方便Kevin还给我们准备了很多食物我们非常喜欢这个房子
24542177,327926119,2018-09-24,25340270,Gabrielle,Perfect location and beautiful place to stay! I would recommend this spot to any of my friends or family.
5863674,49473912,2015-10-04,5567043,Louise,Al went over and above to ensure we had a great stay here. A five star host. The apartment has a great view it's also all very new and of high quality. There are trains and buses about a 10min walk away which will take you in to town which was really continent. There are some bakery's and coffee shops in the village too. Overall this place was perfect for our stay in San Francisco. 
15132855,530482379,2019-09-15,45936673,Jim,I just checked out of Erin’s house and received the system message requesting my review. I found myself at a loss for the words that could express my appreciation for the hosts and their flat. So I started reading the reviews left by other guests. Everyone commented on the perfect location the stylish quiet apartment the fantastic hosts and amenities. Then it occurred to me that despite all the other great Airbnb apartments in San Francisco this was the fourth time that I have chosen to stay at their apartment. How does that proverb go: actions speak louder than words!
23354077,557761634,2019-11-01,3146919,Patrick,Another great stay in Dolores Heights - high standards as ever.
2166428,28335730,2015-03-22,28648755,Michael,Tisa's apt was exactly what I was looking for - clean and quiet but walking distance to everywhere I wanted to be in SF.
5117701,254076363,2018-04-15,27907665,Melinda,Stefan’s place was a great home base for our trip to San Francisco.  Centrally located on the edge of Chinatown you are walking distance to many great restaurants and bars.  Plus the cable car runs right our your front door and the bus stop is right around the corner.  The apartment itself has a spacious kitchen that you could easily prepare a meal if you choose to eat in. The bathroom although small is functional and with the on demand hot water heater you have plentiful hot water.  Stefan was great to work with and very communicative.  I would not hesitate to stay here again!
14265180,289205974,2018-07-11,4582216,Mahra,Just as described and pictured. Colorful vibrant neighborhood. Convenient to buses and trolley. Very very comfortable and upscale accommodations. Would stay again. Thank you!
1344752,26246054,2015-02-08,6162681,Sarah And Adam,Great apartment easy communication with the host. Recommended!
21122475,528784270,2019-09-13,20690277,Katherine,Smooth check-in clean room. Price was reasonable for the area and the garden space was a plus!
14944663,566530803,2019-11-19,235405987,Octadesk,A very caring person responds quickly helps with questions and has a beautiful house organized and clean! Close to everything! Thank you!
3727061,23366235,2014-11-30,9837646,Peter,My family and I had a wonderful time staying at Tim's Victorian over Thanksgiving. The apartment was spacious clean and well-furnished and the location was amazing (with a number of great restaurants cafes and coffeeshops within a few block radius). Tim was friendly and accommodating and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the apartment to others.
23359552,295957728,2018-07-24,41045069,Julie,Peter was welcoming and very knowledgeable about the city. The room was clean and quiet.
883937,121932071,2016-12-19,23637054,BoBae,"Suzy is very nice host. She's very kind and fast. The house is super clean and cozy. Everything I need is prepared. It's little smaller than I expected but very well-organized.
After 10pm I can't watch TV. That is the only thing I care during the stay. Except the one thing the stay is perfect. Highly recommended!"
6628985,274278259,2018-06-08,395046,Leighanna,Sylvie's place was wonderful and we had a great stay there! When we first arrived Sylvie greeted me and my husband and gave us some suggestions on places to eat and things to do which was really nice. We loved the central location and the fact that there was a Trader Joe's and Target right across the street (we ended up going to Trader Joe's for snacks so it was great having that option)! The nearest BART stop (Civic Center) was about $10 to take an Uber from but if you really wanted to you could walk it (would be difficult with a suitcase though like we had). The area was safe to walk around and everything we needed to get to was a short and inexpensive Uber/Lyft trip away (or if you enjoy walking there is A LOT to do within a 2 mile radius)! My husband and I loved having the large space in the room the bed was large and comfy WiFi was solid and there was even a TV with cable. Overall a wonderful stay and we were very happy we chose to stay with Sylvie. Thanks for everything!
4227441,31635104,2015-05-08,26421438,Shelley,Maria was and made us very welcome. She was friendly and attentive but left us to ourselves as well. I would highly recommend staying with her. The room was as you see it cozy clean fresh and private. The neighbourhood is interesting with Golden Gate Park and it's attractions just around the corner along with a large whole food supermarket with all the food you need buses bike hire and restaurants. At night the area was quiet and peaceful down Maria's street.
9650878,215119347,2017-11-27,11527309,Jeremy,Carl is just the NICEST person! Too nice! He went above and beyond to make sure everything was good for me. I was so happy to have stayed here and that I got to meet him. The room is beautiful with a nice desk to get work done - a great place to just be to do anything you need to do or just rest after a long day out. I didn't get to use the kitchen as I usually do if I stay longer because it was only 3 days but it looked very well equipped and pretty much lets you do just about anything you want. It's also at a great area with lots of restaurants nearby. You will be well taken care of. Get this place.
12930338,461494957,2019-05-31,50996293,Judith,This was our second time staying at Anna's place.  So comfortable and homey like a cabin.  Convenient back yard for our dog.  Anna is just wonderful!
22968438,334365040,2018-10-08,74190555,Aymeric,Nous n’avons pas pu rencontrer Shaun mais il est très réactif et nous a bien aidé pour arriver de l’aeroport jusque chez lui! L’appartement est fonctionnel bien équipé propre. Situé dans un quartier calme et agréable. Chambre individuelle avec 2 salles de bain pour 3 chambres et un salon-cuisine en commun. Prévoir des transports en commun ou Uber pour se rendre dans les endroits touristiques de la ville!
5632275,122944153,2016-12-26,5612457,Dianne,Sarah's place is quaint and cozy in a beautiful neighborhood close to shopping/ restaurants and easy walking distance to the Mission and the Castro districts. And Sarah was a responsive and welcoming host. Hope to be back soon!
4287481,218444211,2017-12-12,38604489,Georg,It was a pleasure to stay at Rumesha's place. The apartment was very clean and well equipped with everything you need. They even were so nice to provide several refreshments and a bottle of wine at my arrival. Everything went very well and the owners went out of their way to be helpful. Can only recommend staying there!
17438541,221808658,2017-12-27,1302006,Beverly,Incredibly gracious host!
23025299,350225839,2018-11-18,22624272,Kitty,Great place and great location! The space is smaller than expected but did the trick! Rachel is a great host and always available to help.
6301675,556166832,2019-10-28,72684858,Michael,Great host to deal with
21399171,543489015,2019-10-07,45523714,Hannah,I have stayed in a lot of Airbnbs and this was one of the best experiences I have ever had.  I was welcomed at the door by Anders which was helpful as the apartment is on a very very steep road and I had a heavy bag.  The listing was so welcoming clean and stylish with concrete floors mid century and modern furniture and spotlessly clean.    Anders and Tommy found out the snacks I liked before I came and I had copious amounts of chocolate and nuts and an amazing coffee machine which was used a lot!   The bed was one of the most comfortable I  have ever stayed in and I felt very welcomed and very at home there.    There were so many lovely touches to pastries delivered to my door on Saturday morning to thoughtful texts when we experienced a mild earthquake to a leaving gift and card.    They went out of their way to make my stay memorable and as I was travelling for work it really meant a lot to know I had a lovely space and home to go back to each day.   Thank you Anders for being the best Airbnb host ever! I'll definitely be trying to book next time I come.   Cannot recommend this listing enough!
4500244,207233512,2017-10-28,274719,Matthew,Elizabeth helped me out on very short notice after I had a last minute cancelation from another host.  I felt so lucky to get the chance to stay at her place!  It's a great location right on the park.  I was able to do some cooking in the kitchen and got a great night's rest every night on the bed.  It was so nice to wake up each morning and have the park right outside my doorstep!
24670819,553652984,2019-10-24,2260175,Raj,Lovely studio apartment great amenities very clean and excellent location. Looks just like the photos and was perfect for my family of four (with my two  young children very comfortable on the sofa bed). Young was very responsive to our questions and requests. Would definitely stay here again! Thank you!!
479072,559801314,2019-11-04,2989840,Matt,Viola and family were fantastic hosts the place was clean and just as described. Would highly recommend to anyone coming to SF!

8167459,96683853,2016-08-23,14400814,Marijke,We had a wonderful stay in Michelle's home. Good neighbourhood close to the beach and the SF highlights. We slept great and had breakfast with all the goodies that Michelle left for us. Much beter then a hotel! Thanks Michelle 
27439635,428288801,2019-03-24,343092,Christian,This is the place to be. Wonderful house and very nice and helpful hosts. Five stars across all categories!
28803800,545098358,2019-10-11,126449647,Katy,Pete's home was both extremely convenient and very beautiful. It was a great stay and would definitely stay again in the future!
1759087,19826057,2014-09-19,5123214,Eoin,Great listing in a nice part of town. I didn't get to meet Gerardo during my stay - however he was a super communicator - the check in process was smooth and the listing was perfect for my work trip to SF.
3218306,341020299,2018-10-25,84683000,Johann,Joshua's place is lovely with a beautiful view of the city. Check-in was a breeze and I was allowed to check in early since I arrived fairly early into the city. Everything was very clean and well organized. Unfortunately Joshua was out of town but that meant I had the whole place to myself and he was very prompt to respond to any messages and was super nice. Would definitely stay again and recommend to everyone.
18873809,348170734,2018-11-12,205704620,Stuart,Very clean and has everything you would need. We were left in peace but the hosts were always available when we needed them
14220594,115324599,2016-11-23,17957463,Karl,Joseph's place was great. It has a superb kitchen with everything you need. Joseph even left some breakfast for me to get me started in the morning. The other rooms are much bigger than the photos would suggest. The neighborhood although not purely residential is very quiet. I would recommend Joseph's place to anyone visiting San Francisco.
13789725,177137955,2017-08-01,90442427,Patrice,Jennifer's place was really two blocks away from the beach. It was a perfect oasis in a very walkable neighborhood. My family and I enjoyed the guidebook and other materials to help us check out San Francisco. We were greeted with snacks and chilled water and our every need was anticipated. Jennifer was very responsive and I would highly recommend her apartment!
654279,6405110,2013-08-11,7734366,Neus,"We have been really well in their home.They make you feel as in your own home. Chris and Tim give you everything they can offer you and you can keep your privacy at the same time. Everything was very clean and their home jam is so delicious!
You have help to know the city and many places to vidit:restaurantstourist interestseesights and tours....
If we came back to San Francisco we would go to their home again.

2518781,45365885,2015-09-02,4861114,Christian,Scott's apartment in Bernal Heights is small and cozy. It does not feel small however because there are many cleverly positioned mirrors. It is well equipped with a stove microwave TV and an ironing board as well as a washing mashine and a dryer (both in a room just outside of the apartment). It has a small sheltered garden where you can enjoy a breakfast or a meal when it's warm outside. A bus stop and a supermarket are just around the corner of the house. You will need about 30 to 40 minutes to get downtown (Union Square) by bus. We recommend taking the BART subway. The next station is at Mission & 24th Street. Bernal Heights hill has an amazing overlook and is just a few minutes away. It's a nice walk up the hill and very rewarding especially at sunset. There are lots of restaurants and cafés nearby. This apartment is suitable especially for younger couples.
3042811,474102873,2019-06-22,3320006,Ryan,Fantastic place - perfect location (super quiet street but near three awesome neighborhoods). Clean.

21233544,570493049,2019-11-29,262961028,Alex,"Michele and her husband are SO warm inviting and welcoming.  They had plenty of direction and resources for us when we arrived to the house.  The lower quarters we stayed in was absolutely perfect.  Clean with plenty of amenities.  Beautifully decorated quiet and peaceful it made our trip to SF that much more enjoyable.  Great location and definitely missing it already!!  You can’t go wrong with choosing to stay in this place...book now.

thanks again Michele & D!"
30701028,523929221,2019-09-04,120146423,Anthony,Great location and great amenities!! Such an amazing find!! I will stay here every visit!
20367796,246607856,2018-03-25,80824394,Zach,"Je & Derren are nice people and live upstairs full-time. A cleaner comes every day so common spaces (two bathrooms and a small kitchen) are always very clean. Parking is free as advertised and there is tons of parking. The ceiling is thin and you can hear the family moving around up there in the morning and at night but nothing obnoxious. Hosts provide earplugs just in case you are extremely sensitive to noise. There are several other rooms that are being rented out as well so you will run into several other roommates during your stay. Be sure to check out the other rooms to make sure you get the space you want -- some rooms are more compact than others. 
Travel to and from the house is simple. We used Uber to get to places within the city -- not somewhere that is walking distance from downtown or the ""tourist"" destinations but that was better for us."
63247,185105764,2017-08-20,34061437,Michael,Anne's place was great and in a great location! Would recommend to any person or couple staying in San Fransisco.
8524982,262400675,2018-05-08,90606307,Andrej,Tolle Unterkunft in einer guten Lage in der Nähe des Pier 39 Lombard Street und Fisherman's Wharf. Es gibt genügend Cafes und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe. Shane und Shaudi haben immer schnell auf Anfragen geantwortet. Super freundlich und zuvorkommend.  Wir haben morgens gerne unseren Kaffee auf der Dachterasse getrunken mit einem traumhaften Blick auf die Golden Gate Bridge. Die Unterkunft kann man ohne wenn und aber weiter empfehlen.
2471457,26137433,2015-02-04,14086120,Liliana,Super quartier proche de tout et au calme. Très belle maison dans le style de San Francisco : il ne faut pas manquer celà. Boris est très disponible et discret en meme temps. N'ayez pas peur des chiens ils sont adorables. Merci encore pour tous les conseils sur les alentours.
17606766,489415909,2019-07-16,85339181,Tracy,Spacious and clean place to stay. Having 2 bathrooms and multiple beds was important to our family. Nice location near the beach and short drive to SF attractions. Parking space is very convenient. Quiet neighborhood too. Overall great place.
4418649,495853345,2019-07-26,128504804,Dominic,Zemfira’s place was within walking distance of many restaurants coffee shops and grocery stores. There was also great access to public transport near by. The room was large and had a workspace and everything was super clean! Zemfira was extremely accomodating as a host and very nice to her guests. Overall a great stay would highly recommend!

28459015,476239265,2019-06-25,72371679,Alyssa,Had a really pleasant stay! There’s a great view of the ocean and the bathroom/common areas are always very tidy. Be aware there’s a lot of people in the house at one time so fridge space is tight and bathrooms are in high demand at peak hours—wasn’t a huge deal to me though so I had a great time.
17445405,286168347,2018-07-05,92886502,Eduardo,We loved the house; the interior design the quiteness and cleanliness. It’s very confortable and Igor always answered our questions and doubts at time. Thanks Igor we hope to meet you in person next time.
1855096,75156661,2016-05-19,778414,Jola,Michael was a phenomenal host and amazing in his communication. He was able to be flexible on my check-in time to accommodate my visits with my sons and parents on Mother's Day (a true gift).  His Fabulous Artist Flat is immaculate. Michael has thought of all the extras to ensure a wonderful stay. I would stay at Michael's listing again without hesitation. 
10524804,167171840,2017-07-05,123130113,Emily,This is an amazing find in the San Francisco/Bay Area. Caite and Josh were extremely helpful responsive and welcoming during all points of our stay. If you are looking to stay somewhere where you can escape from the touristy and hectic downtown (although it is very easy to get downtown if you want to) this is your place. There are some amazing coffee cafes restaurants and shops in the sunset district. And of course the gorgeous beach is within walking distance! It is such a cozy quaint and lovely area of the city--and better yet the apartment is beautifully decorated and very clean. We absolutely loved our stay here and I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience the authentic culture and food that San Francisco has to offer. 
9605720,243126159,2018-03-14,158739486,Suzanne,If you want the million dollar view and great location in the heart of the city this is it.
3183280,83890777,2016-07-04,68998393,Casey,Amazing loft. Beautiful view day or night: you feel like you've stepped into a movie. Aruna made everything incredibly easy and most importantly she made us feel welcome. 
10437411,131788751,2017-02-13,6165412,Sylvia,We loved it and would definitely stay again!  Chip and Angela have considered every comfort detail.  A great place to unwind before hitting the sights of San Francisco.  Highly recommended!!
3416013,325448048,2018-09-19,7229286,Imad,"Emily's place is just wonderful.  One of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed in. She was very quick to respond and a great host.  She went above and beyond and answered any of our questions regarding the area as well.  Her place is very clean and spacious - and even comes with two lovely cats.  
Amenities are top-notch and location is superb.  Views make it even better.  I would highly recommend Emily's place."
23258326,338180148,2018-10-18,77917309,Kasra,Ronil's apartment is a really comfortable clean and modern place. He was also very accommodating and quick to respond. It was an awesome stay overall
472901,9817168,2014-01-12,9598248,Cristina,"Jin's place and the experience she provided me as a host were great! She was very sweet and waited for me to check-in after my flight was very much delayed. The place was lovely clean and very comfy and the location was just perfect! I would definitely recommend it and will stay again. Thank you Jin!

840986,101926024,2016-09-15,3557050,Manal,"STAY HERE! This apartment is a dream: spacious CLEAN (understatement) quiet modern great location and even better owners. 

Communication was brilliant. Flexibility was great. Check in was a breeze and check out was simple. 

The neighbourhood is safe and just a short distance from all the main attractions SF has to offer. 

Thank you both for the lovely stay. We said it before and I definitely mean it we could have easily just moved into your apartment and called it home :-) "
18639196,459851393,2019-05-27,15624994,Kenny,The entire place is very professionally managed. A truly comfortable and cozy stay.

If I go to SanFrancisco againI would love to stay there!"
24230206,520007202,2019-08-29,16250833,Gary,Eduardo's loft is a diamond in SOMA! The loft is hip and stylish with upscale accents that show great attention to detail. Eduardo met me at the door and gave me the tour of the place but after that I was on my own. His instructions were easy to follow the house manual had clear steps for everything from using the A/V system to working the blinds and I felt right at home. I'd recommend the loft for anyone who wants to feel like they've made it big in SF (without all those pesky extra costs of actually DOING so). Thanks again Eduardo!
13021568,485414881,2019-07-10,122749897,一,感谢Peihong的建议住的附近步行6分钟有很多粤菜馆｡对于奔波了好多天的我们来说简直是救命了｡开车到金门大桥等各景点都很方便｡

1007157,27533641,2015-03-07,22993041,Brad,"Photos do a great job showing off how pretty this please place is. We had 4 of us stay on a business trip and it was a great alternative to hotel rooms. The host was very easy to work with and was very flexible with our schedule. 
Easy access door with code great accommodations bedding and towels. good movie selection in the den we watched road warrior. Overall a very clean house and very comfortable. Would gladly stay again. "
748256,12044921,2014-04-22,10733455,Audrey,Michael and Yessica were away during our stay at the apartment we just get to meet Yessica the last day she is really nice and helpful. The apartment is just awesome really beautiful and spacious. The room we stayed in was really confortable as well as the bathroom. We shared it with another fantastic family with whom we spent wonderful time. It's really well located and close to the bus and the BART. 
18397875,312551722,2018-08-23,17334595,Katie,Anjna's place is beautiful!  This place was perfect for myself my husband and four year old son.  We were very comfortable.  Keyless entry was very convenient as was access to a washer/dryer and the treadmill in the spare room.  We did not have any issues finding parking right outside on the street during our 3 night stay.  There is not great access to public transportation however if you have a car the location is great for exploring all around the Bay Area.   There are some great restaurants in walking distance and the house is very close to Golden Gate Park and Ocean Beach as well.  Communication with Anjna was great and she was able to arrange for us to stay an extra night at the last minute.  There was a box of small toys in the unit that our son loved playing with.  Would definitely recommend and would stay again!
2316478,21040289,2014-10-10,21076486,Katie And Richard,Can't recomment Angeline more. The accomodation was great. Two blocks from the ocean and so close to the bustling centre of the city. Six of us travelled from Ireland Dubai and Amsterdam and couldn't have asked for a more thorough host in that the directions were clear and any queries were handled with immediate effect. If I was returning would definately stay here again great place.
16678379,280229350,2018-06-22,128551415,Christina,Michelle’s place was very clean and had all the amenities we needed for our 3-day stay in San Francisco. We loved that it was walking distance to Golden Gate Park and we spent a good part of our trip exploring the San Francisco Botanical Gardens the Japanese Tea Garden and the Conservatory of Flowers. Even though it took a bit longer for us to get downtown we appreciated staying in such a safe residential neighbourhood.
23352511,541728315,2019-10-05,206306220,Kyle,If you need a place to stay near the Mission this is a great option. 
17343208,332207837,2018-10-04,35585930,Jay,Cool retro-Haight Ashbury co-op. Wonderful value. The street scene might be a bit unnerving for those unfamiliar with SF. Easy public transit which is a big plus.
17551632,252695924,2018-04-11,50913454,Chris,Susanna’s place is great for its value! She was extremely responsive and the place was nicely decorated. There are restaurants and bars within walking distance and the bart is about a 10 min walk away.
934012,10378961,2014-02-17,10152995,Christine,"David has been a very helpful and thoughtful host and at the same time discrete. A lot of details that made our stay very easy and comfortable. Is the perfect place to be with or without a family. Beautiful house clean and cozy very well located. We have gone to the Science museum in Golden Gate park walking. A lot of restaurants and shops near by. Now you know where to stay in San Francisco. Thanks a lot to David his daughter that provided us good advices before we go and to Airnb.
Un petit mot en français pour les francophones. La maison de David est réellement une très bonne option pour visiter San Francisco. Tout y est pour rendre le séjour extrêmement plaisant. "
11297447,90102120,2016-07-31,56194231,Tom,We enjoyed our stay at the GT SF. Perfect location and staff were extremely helpful with recommendations. Lots of things also going on at the hostel if you're a single traveller.
329020,1091034,2012-04-06,341695,Romy,This place is an absolute gem. Great location right by Southpark and close to anything SoMa -- the Clocktower building is architecturally amazing and Jorges apartment is furnished with absolute style plus was the most welcoming and caring host. Would highly recommend it.
1336798,13467841,2014-05-28,10895689,Emmanuel,"We stayed one whole week at Judith's house downtown San-Francisco and we were 8 people all together. The house is situated in a fantastic neigbourhood and the house description fits with reality: 4 convenient bedrooms with 25 bathrooms. A point of attention: one of the bedroom gathers one bed for two people and one additional bed (above) for a child.

The day before arriving we got every necessary information and we did nod have any problems to open the door. We liaise with Judith to get some additional informations regarding kitchenware.  About the listing the only (small) problem is linked to lunch/dinner table size fitting 6 people easily but a little bit too small for 8 people..."
678556,26299239,2015-02-09,9294667,Karen,"Our host was extremely nice! She checked in on us a few times to make sure everything was all right. The listing was exactly as expected. Very cute quaint and spacious for 2 people. Everything was accounted for (little bottles of water extra towels kitchenware small trash cans).

The location is so perfect. It's in a prime location and we never drove more than 20 minutes to get to our favorite spots in the city.

Parking was not an issue. There was always a spot open on the street. Just make sure you read the signs so you don't get a parking citation!"
9605720,196625419,2017-09-23,906207,Linda,"This simple apartment is in a fantastic location. Close to the Ferry  Building Moma Market. The view from the living room is to die for. The neighborhood is teaming with small Asian food markets kids walking home from school old men in the park playing checkers. 
I am a bike rider. I could walk my bike down Stockton through China Town and then could head out from the Ferry Building for fantastic rides.
The folks running the apartment rental were easy to communicate with and access into the apartment was simple. Parking is a bit of an issue. But it is San Francisco!"
27439635,409787365,2019-02-08,227925374,Ramones,An amazing stay with above-and-beyond amenities!
479072,17630023,2014-08-15,17926461,Mariana,The studio is clean and spacious the garden is beautiful. We didn't get to meet Viola but she was reachable by text. And accomodating to our needs travelling with baby. It is a steepy hill in a nice neighborhood. Five minute walk to subway.

32136274,508343746,2019-08-12,13004995,Anna,Camille's home is a beautiful place to stay in San Fran! Her home was able to accommodate a large group. Her rooms were all very clean and comfortable. The house is close to the bart station and a short ride to Mission District! Camille was a great host who replied quickly to all of our needs.
208831,26862606,2015-02-21,23600222,Christoph,"Peter was a very gently host. He helped me a lot with knowing my way round in SF and proposed many places that were definitly worth seeing!
The place is located perfectly in north beach just between fishermens wharf and downtown. Everything can be done walking - great!"
18450146,179513886,2017-08-07,133625244,Jenni,Peters's place is just as is advertised. Very nice and clean yet simple. The bed is comfy and the shower is amazing! Great views from the top of the hill but not a lot of sunshine on this side. We did have a little trouble with the door one day but Peter responded in less than 5 minutes and got us all settled in. Communication was great from start to finish and would definitely recommend Peters place!
27729286,402823686,2019-01-19,16727924,Molly,Holly’s place was impeccably decorated and exactly what we were looking for in an Airbnb during our wedding weekend. She welcomed us with flowers and champagne to congratulate us which was such a thoughtful touch. Her recommendations came in handy for our guests as well. Very much looking forward to staying at her home during our next trips back to the bay!
3549398,69234856,2016-04-10,55638458,翊凡,Cozy house wonderful view. Michael take really good cares of us. Perfect experience~
16242493,170124696,2017-07-14,107046356,Ken,Good listing! And the host is easygoing. I will definitely consider going back to this listing again!

4365969,114335242,2016-11-17,69356,Gillian,"Leslie went above and beyond. She even emailed me in advance of my visit to find out my snack preferences! The space is clean bright and well-appointed.

I wish I'd had more time to hang out and enjoy the lovely outside space!

Location is excellent - super close to 280 and BART and a few charming restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity."
2984463,123112751,2016-12-27,24450753,Pearl,This is my first time staying in Howard's place and I must say this is my favorite space! I wasn't able to meet Howard face-to-face but my boyfriend said check in was easy not only was Howard very generous but he was kind enough to let him park in front of his drive way. The room looks exactly like the pictures; spacious cozy and very clean. The location is very convenient and walking distance to public transportation restaurants bars and there is a market place right across the street. Also 5min drive to Urban Putt (the only inside golf/bar in SF). If the room was available I would definitely book  for NYE. I suggest booking in ADVANCE. Thank You again Howard! 
220418,2028831,2012-08-19,2798028,Karolina And Erik,Our stay at Joshs place was absolutely perfect! We arrived late at night so Josh had given us the entry details beforehand. We actually never met Josh during our stay which was a pitty but he made us feel at home anyways with free water at the front door and little cookies. I would definetly go back to haight ashbury again! Thank you Josh!
148769,360674081,2018-12-21,128822777,Ron,"Kyle was awesome.  He responded right away and stayed in communications at all times.  The ascend was more strenuous than expected but well worth the efforts. Kyle adjusted the path and pace according to our individual physical conditions. He was very informative of the surroundings and was engaging and funny while hiking.   The nourishments he provided mid climb were welcomed and necessary!  He recommends bringing 2 liters of water and we drank it all.  Although initially we contemplated walking at the evening to gaze over the sunset we decided to go early in the morning.  It was a good choice for us as it was cooler and less crowded during that time.  Our college aged children all agreed it was one of the highlights of our stay in South Africa.  The views along the way were spectacular and Kyle had made this memorable excursion that much better.  
We had left the car far from the end point.  Kyle sprinted back to the original parking spot and then came to pick us up in his car.  He delivered us back at our original site both safe and content.   We could not have asked for a better guide."
334339,21377399,2014-10-16,19311039,Stephen,"My first experience with Airbnb and it was a great one.  Hosts were very welcoming explaining everything about the place and offering any assistance I would need.  Room was certainly everything that was described.  I would add that the whole place was immaculate the mattress and bedding were very comfortable--I slept great.  Bathroom likewise exceptionally clean and equipped with everything you would need.  Neighborhood and location super with bus stop right across the street but also very walk-able.  Highly recommended.

379349,523903780,2019-09-04,240161057,Alexander,Great place to stay local area is perfect and if you wanted to could stay there for the whole trip with no need to go downtown.
166771,100168779,2016-09-07,29284639,Pascale Et Régis,Ce séjour a été très agréable et Patti est une hote très sympathique. L'appartement est d'un grand confort avec du joli mobilier ancien. La situation est parfaite pour visiter San Francisco.

3257979,202092626,2017-10-09,44770567,Patrice,This place is absolutely wonderful! Robert was gracious and kind and informative. I was delighted to be with this Family for my stay. I was working the whole time but got to meet the Family(except for Matthew) and every body was super sweet! Cali and Nancy introduced themselves early one morning and made my day much better  because I got to pet Cali and talk with Nancy for a bit. Awesome Place / Awesome family! Highly Recommended! I hope to stay here again soon.... Thanks Robert!

13443665,231130157,2018-01-30,77145361,Cheryl,Deborah and Noor were delightful hosts!  The pics don’t do their place justice as it is extremely charming!  My daughter and I were on site a lot and found it to be very quite and peaceful day and night.  Completely satisfied with our choice in the SF area and would stay again when we’re in town.
17642091,211680374,2017-11-13,26758081,Jon,The apartment was great! The pictures do not do this place justice. Nick and Audrey are very responsive and communicative.  The place is also just a short walk away from everything in the Mission or a short drive/uber/lyft to downtown or Golden Gate. Would definitely recommend!
10427768,245820953,2018-03-23,19527927,Brian,It was a wonderful stay
2188976,66710461,2016-03-24,12271391,Rachel,Great room/house. Jason was great at providing recommendations of what to do in the city. Easy arrival/departure. Appreciated that we could store our bags there before our late night flight home on the last day. 
20799337,356015089,2018-12-06,9769333,Claire,Fantastic Airbnb! Charles is a very helpful host the space is clean/stylish and in a prime location.

36157346,479357625,2019-06-30,116130457,Mariah,We loved this place and felt really lucky to stumble upon it! Jesus and Ron were incredibly welcoming and immediately made us feel super comfortable. We stayed in the living room area on the sofa bed. It felt private due to the partitions that Jesus and Ron put up which was a nice touch! The Bart station is just a 10-15 minute walk from the house so access to the city was really convenient. We highly recommend staying here!
28674015,412127095,2019-02-14,199091811,Carlyn,Just top notch. Joey was communicative hospitable and thoughtful. It was easy street parking and Joey thought of every amenity possible. It was quiet and so clean. It’s a secure neighborhood with some great places to eat nearby. Thank you Joey for a stellar stay! Would 100% recommend.
15236335,156447111,2017-05-30,19537464,Martin,Mai was an excellent host and went out of her way to help us with logistics. 
2115503,112805612,2016-11-07,85789140,Emma,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we spent a lot of time trying to find the ideal place. The location was ideal - close to the beach and amenities with some fantastic walks nearby and only a short car journey to the centre of San Francisco. We did attempt to walk to Fisherman's Wharf one day - it ended up taking 2 1/2 hours! But taxis were frequent and easy to find if required. The small parade of cafes and restaurants on the street a short walk away were ideal. We had some fantastic breakfasts up there.

Golden Gate Park is also nearby and provided some lovely scenery. Be prepared to walk to places but the reward once you get there is worth it! 

Whilst we never had to contact our hosts who live above the apartment it was comforting to know they were available should we need assistance. The apartment was self-contained and had everything as described and was immaculately clean and tidy. The lack of a TV was no problem because there is literally so much to do in the local area we were hardly ever at the apartment!

The area itself was quiet and apart from some roadworks happening just outside during our visit we never had any issues with outside noise. We felt secure during our time there as the entrance to the apartment is fairly well hidden.

Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone visiting San Francisco - it was perfect!"
20258481,267752447,2018-05-22,3058821,Daniel,Terry was a great host he greeted me after we coordinated my arrival time and showed me around his place. Throughout my stay he was available and willing to give recommendations if I asked but not overbearing at all. His place was clean/neat and has many thoughtfully placed plants and decor great natural light and nice hardwood floors. As for the room the bed was very comfortable the towel soft and there were a few hangers in the closet (which I appreciated as I didn't really have luggage space to bring my own). His place is close to many things to do/see in the city but has enough separation from the noise you might expect (esp at night) in the city. The cats were friendly as described and clearly well-loved. I will definitely consider staying again and would happily recommend his place to friends/family.
8192881,130827578,2017-02-08,53485713,Chris,View is even better than the picture.
29992190,445035545,2019-04-28,201171496,Nickie,Awesome and fun! Would stay again!
10660892,532929708,2019-09-20,103203020,Ann,We could not have felt more welcome comfortable safe and pleased with John's guest apartment.  Location is ideal a breeze from any part of the city the privacy wonderful apartment spotless neighborhood/park friendly and interesting.  Shops grocery store and restaurants easy walking distances.  John is honestly a 'Super' host flexible and kind.  We hope to return!
5094146,81220195,2016-06-21,58224625,Kudo,Abhay was great host and Cody was super adorable dog! I stayed 3nights. When I arrived Abhay was not there and his roommate and Cody welcomed me. She explained me everything. They told me around the city. The rooms are exactly  same as pictures. It was really clean and comfortable. I want to stay again if I have a chance to visit San Fransisco!
1907229,9938077,2014-01-20,6388523,Tania,Neeta & her house were great! I booked it for my 30th birthday as a place to have in the city for the weekend. The location was ideal as its walking distance to Fillmore and to the bars in Divisadero. Overall my experience was easy and smooth. 
238204,79747338,2016-06-14,12005168,Kelvin,"Jennifer and her father were both very hospitable the space was both clean and very comfortable. They both took time to show me around the immediate area and ensured that I had everything I needed to make the stay pleasurable.

6331695,299848984,2018-07-31,5075038,Darrel,"Danielle's place is as stylish as looks. The rooms are big the shower is hot and access to the washer/dryer is great for visitors on an extended stay. The location is on a quiet street
in Noe Valley and is about 5-6 blocks south of 24th Street. 24th St has Whole Foods and all of the SF charm that you would expect. This location is hilly so be aware and pack sensible shoes. Also the location has ample street parking unlike most places in San Francisco."

20967325,313069445,2018-08-24,196613639,Viva,The charming Victorian was clean and in  a great location near Golden Gate Park. Our host communicated quickly and even had a surprise bottle of wine. Our family enjoyed walking the neighborhood and experiencing the diverse culture. Thanks for a great stay in San Francusco!

13127954,174408560,2017-07-25,78451390,Michele,My husband and I really loved Sarah and Pankaj's place.  Not only was the apartment beautiful and comfortable but the neighborhood was quiet and really fun to explore.  We found great restaurants a coffee shop and a grocery store within a short walk from the apartment.  We also either walked to many of our destinations or took public transportation that was easy and close by.
5196399,103114125,2016-09-20,16760912,Joakim,This place is pretty awesome. Zain and Duncan are great hosts and the whole atmosphere is very relaxed and welcoming. The location is great in the Mission and easy to get around to other parts of the city. If you need privacy and quiet while traveling this might not be the place for you. But if you enjoy meeting lots of different people and making plans on the fly with new friends from all over the world you can't find any place better than this.
24723,109296020,2016-10-20,82303039,Jonel,The apartment is centrally located from many of the fantastic sights in the city. Only 1/2 a block away from local restaurants and shops.  Our stay there was awesome!

13913555,277163356,2018-06-15,6096405,Catherine,Great place!  Perfect location - within walking distance to the Financial District Union Square Chinatown etc.  Our place was very clean and spacious.
38815628,569138899,2019-11-25,297202516,Richard,Great place wonderfully large shared space. Great convenient locations!
34693459,487177325,2019-07-13,215468387,Emily,Tony’s place was an amazing experience and a great way to get to know San Fransisco! I’ve visited San Fran before but Tony gave me lots of new tips and experiences to explore! The room was VERY clean and there were a lot of wonderful fresh flowers all over the room! Tony was very warm and friendly and greeted us as soon as we entered the house. He gave us a tour and made all the rules/ expectations very clear! Make sure you check out his toothpaste collection from around the world in the bathroom! Very cool! I will definitely stay with him  again if I’m ever in SF!
648086,152824548,2017-05-18,2146986,Daniel,Alles ist exakt wie beschrieben! Wir reisen mit einem Baby und unser Aufenthalt bei Ponge war problemlos in jeder Hinsicht. Sehr netter Host gute Lage - was will man mehr. Wir können für Unterkunft wärmstens empfehlen.
33578,133317479,2017-02-21,15689635,Jenny,We had a lovely time (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication and check-in were seamless and the highlight was the gorgeous garden and backyard area.
516836,20544845,2014-10-01,12777419,Kim,Beautiful and very comfortable home.  Fun to actually stay inside one of those San Francisco houses that we always walk by and wonder what they look like inside.  Our room was very comfortable with all the amenities we needed- wireless TV nice bathroom great city view.  The kitchen was available for our use and Fran made us feel welcome and at ease.  If it is available the next time we are in the area we will stay again!
16228848,273344218,2018-06-05,184185295,Philipp,great location
259622,243945024,2018-03-17,17595838,Emily,What an amazing hostel with a friendly community feel. I can’t say enough positive aspects of my visit! I’ve moved on to stay at a different location in the city and I miss PT hostel already! I would recommend this experience to anyone open minded who likes company while traveling somewhere new.
20258481,251905212,2018-04-08,4873495,Mauricio,Our stay at Terry's place was very nice and went as smoothly as possible. The house is located in a nice and quiet neighborhood close enough to downtown SF for an easy commute but far from crowded streets noise and difficult parking situation. The room is very comfortable and clean and Terry and Laura are great hosts. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

8576907,84155517,2016-07-05,30439284,Nick,We had a fantastic time! Dana was such a wonderful host the house was lovely and in a great area. Dana was extremely efficient at communication throughout the whole process and made everything easy. I would wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone visiting San Francisco.
29289176,556534787,2019-10-29,74336254,Nick,The apartment is a nice 1 bedroom in the Haight / Ashbury. The location was perfect bed comfortable and house easy to use. The apt helped make our S.F vacation quite memorable.
241235,112189200,2016-11-04,33060641,Hernan,Perfect location you can walk everywhere or take a really cheap uber great staff. It has all the necessary stuff.
29417185,569228300,2019-11-25,4159766,Roy,"Hard to beat the price and you get what you pay for.  I had a private room which seems like it is usually rented out by the bed when it is busier.  There were three beds in the room.  The whole place consists of numerous rooms and common areas that seemed a little quiet which is probably because it was a quiet weekend.  

Communication with Alice was great once I checked in.  She was super responsive and addressed all my needs.

Overall the best description I can give of the place is that it feels like you are staying in a frat house right after the cleaners came through.  Good option if you just need a place to sleep or on a budget (both for me).  I’d come back."
59344,554106066,2019-10-25,5628023,Eugene,"Clean convenient and a great value! The lofted space is cozy and quiet. One of the nicest places I've stayed in and would definitely come back here again. Highly recommended!

John was kind and cordial in our few interactions."
7514742,168481031,2017-07-09,114700616,Alexandre,Liebevoll eingerichtete und sehr saubere Wohnung bei einem sehr sympathischen Gastgeber. Das Frühstück das einem jeden Morgen persönlich von John serviert wird ist fantastisch. Er hat uns wertvolle Resisetipps zu San Francisco gegeben. Das Bad war sehr sauber. Gutes Bett und eine bequeme Schlafcouch sind vorhanden. Man kann den Tram um in die Stadt zu fahren oder Fishermans wharf zu erreichen. Es dauert ca. 30 Minuten. Wir können John und seine Unterkunft uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen. 
18928482,228433576,2018-01-19,56885009,Hilary,"My son stayed at Felicity’s before he started at SFSU. She was incredibly helpful and supportive both before and during his stay.
Her hospitality was much appreciated by him and she put herself out to take him places he needed to go and help him find his way around and get sorted.
Can’t thank her enough!"
27937727,547691085,2019-10-15,186131752,Valerie,Small shared bathroom but clean. Construction next door got started early so be aware of this. You can lock the room from the inside but I didn’t get a separate room key. I didn’t have anything valuable I was worried about but this may be an issue for another guest. Great location close to Chinatown and union square. Powell-Hyde Trolley runs right in front so you will hear the dings!
45299,199451,2011-03-15,322429,Dwight,"Our stay was very enjoyable comfortable quiet and private.

We would recommend the studio to others!

16678379,232865287,2018-02-06,34283702,Sinead,Michelle's place was great for my short business trip. It was a clean and comfy room with a lock on the door. And I had a private bathroom which was also very clean.  There was a shared kitchen space but I didn't need to use it. The location was handy and easy to get to work.
10469182,74237090,2016-05-14,105209,Mary,The listing was spot on. It is a clean beautiful hide away.  Very quiet and restful but close to all tourist attractions we were interested in. The private patio is charming and we enjoyed our morning coffee surrounded by the lovely plants. When you enter the courtyard you immediately fell a sense of serenity.  The bath room was very clean and we enjoyed the soft towels. The cinnamon cake was so good. Landy thought of everything fruit drinks and chocolate she made us feel so well taken care of.  
10767017,437523538,2019-04-14,5097197,Sara,Nick's place is perfect - a spacious cozy well designed and decorated home truly in the best location in the mission: a half a block from Dolores Park across the street from the best bakery and market in town. Nick was very responsive and accommodating as well!
59702,8923948,2013-11-25,10184672,Jason,Joe and Toby's Garden Cottage was such a delightful treat! The garden is beautiful and the cottage is cozy and the quirks of the house are wonderfully fun. Joe and Toby were sweet welcoming and charming and it felt like we were staying with familiar friends if not family. If you are interested in a unique place with character and more than a little bit of artful magic don't miss this place!

4527553,442541266,2019-04-23,79977,Thorsten,Great place that I return to when I am in SF. Beautiful classic wooden house with style atmosphere and light.
1970756,202075344,2017-10-09,37108879,James,"A great space in a beautiful house in Bernal Heights. Super close to many restaurants and amenities in the area while just far enough off the main streets to offer a quiet relaxing experience.

Shelley was great throughout. Easy to get in touch with he checked in with me throughout my stay to ensure everything was going well and to see if I needed anything. I would definitely stay at one of Shelley's properties again."
21966629,535186436,2019-09-23,10837316,David,This is the perfect place.  Pretty quiet ideal location.  Comfortable and nicely cared for.
5631995,136605243,2017-03-11,6961755,Angela,Anne is wonderful! During my stay we crossed paths only a few times because I was there for work and visiting friends in the area. She provided a lovely room (super comfy bed and cute desk) and access to the rest of her home - she was even kind enough to offer me some breakfast snacks! The house is located in a very central area in the marina. The  Golden Gate Bridge and Palace of the Fine Arts were a quick run / scenic walk down the road and food was everywhere - Starbucks / Pete's 10 min walk Safeway 10 min walk yummy restaurants 10 - 15 mins. Overall 10 out of 10 would stay again! 
130805,453109,2011-08-17,746037,Virginia,This space is exactly what the title calls it. I might add 'clean comfortable and pleasant.'  Host Sue L. and her husband make guests feel welcome and readily supply helpful information to the traveller unfamiliar with San Francisco transportation et al. In previous trips I stayed at four other places in the Noe Valley-Mission areas; this is the one I would most like to return to. It offered more space privacy and charm.
18329172,248151927,2018-03-30,116333693,Leo,Great place
15605090,122038422,2016-12-20,24132544,Bei,Nice and safe place to stay.Loved it ~~
20155597,367426462,2019-01-04,115339982,Monique,You will not want to leave.  The bathroom is awesome.  Heated toilet? Wow! My potty training daughter was in love.  The apartment was located next to all the toursity stuff which made the commute easy for my toddler and baby.  Matthew was so attentive and helpful.  You will be oh so pleased with your experience.
8356380,127882465,2017-01-21,6049551,Andrea,Cheryl's place was great it felt like we were staying at an aunts or grandmas house. Cheryl had information laid out  perfectly  and she also had SNACKS Which was not expected but a great surprise. Cheryl was very attentive & responsive it felt like staying with family because it felt like home. 
7949624,103668478,2016-09-23,17816108,Emily,Rania is a great host with an immaculate home. Trendy neighborhood with hip local coffee shops and eateries. Rania shared insight about what to do willingly. Simple quiet home with gorgeous views. Would recommend. 
1623609,180996415,2017-08-11,5719724,Anna,This is a great place to stay in San Francisco! Ingrid is a great host she was there to meet us when we arrived and communication was great especially as our flight kept getting delayed and we didn't know what time we would arrive but it wasn't a problem for Ingrid! The place is in a great location if you like having great restaurants and bars nearby this is the perfect place to stay. We can't recommend this place highly enough thank you!
24749696,456911310,2019-05-22,181154430,Javier,Great place for a summer getaway with a nice host
6915497,165399521,2017-07-01,53651033,Jackson,My company and I really enjoyed staying here. It was very comfortable and enjoyable.
593253,426038126,2019-03-19,6346404,Matt,"Trevor really earned the Airbnb title of ""superhost."" Very polite great communication the pictures captured the place well he was full of hospitality he was respectful of my privacy and he went above and beyond my expectations for a good host. Would be happy to stay again!"
3594786,36428075,2015-06-28,660049,Elena,Insiya's home exceeded my expectations and made this trip an unforgettable one. The room was cozy with plenty of natural light and the bed was very comfortable. When ever I had any questions Insiya was always available with suggestions. I would love to stay there again if I am back in SF! 
845501,338895353,2018-10-20,6603974,Marcello,Stayed in the bedroom with view for 3 nights. The room was basic but adequate for my needs. Not too far from city centre and easy enough to get to by car. Outside parking was easy enough. Kitchen facilities were good although did not use them. Shared bathroom was clean and the shower hot. Communication was good and Dolores who I met briefly was very pleasant.
8464365,436306211,2019-04-12,149840426,Brian,Sergio was an amazing host. He was incredible accommodating to our late flight arrival/checkin and the space is gorgeous with amazing views of the city.
29543253,512778311,2019-08-18,52189573,Wendy,This was an absolutely perfect place for a weekend trip in the city. Vitaly is EXTREMELY responsive and very helpful/sincere. The location is great; super close to Golden Gate Park and Sutro Baths as well as a great central point if you want to explore the less crowded and more scenic parts of SF. The room is small obviously but the bed is huge and really comfortable. The interior design is really tasteful and everything is sparkling clean (the bathroom in particular was gorgeous). I'm from the area and compared to what I typically see around here this place was very well-kept and modern. There were also snacks and beverages for us upon arrival! The fact that we were able to have an INDOOR parking spot is such a perk. Like every garage in this city the space is tiny; it took some patience and maneuvering to get my sedan backed in (and that SF drivers are constantly sticking their bumpers into driveway entrances when parked along the curb did not help) but to have parking at all was a true blessing. The price is very reasonable for the area too. Highly recommend!
14948905,153756041,2017-05-21,124158074,Mitch,Awesome! The location was perfect central to everything including public transportation. It was great to have a parking spot. The home was beautiful and clean. Very comfortable. Perfect for our group of three couples. Best of all were our hosts. Bob and Joann did absolutely everything to make our stay good. Perfect stay perfect hosts. Great trip. I would recommend!
24559691,465411045,2019-06-07,112344821,Sylvia,Good place
28589423,338870374,2018-10-20,219704745,Sahil,Really friendly host. Great to talk to. The place is just as shown on AirBnB.
32216182,460240776,2019-05-28,193601,Richard,We loved Hareg's place. It is really attractive and super well maintained. The place is up to date and our favorite part was the bed. OMG It's like falling into a fabulous cloud. Just a perfect  little apartment. Truly met all our needs.
4215907,172404226,2017-07-20,54263766,Samuel,This place is great. Quiet centrally located spacious and very nice inside. The parking was lousy but I wouldn't recommend having a rental in San Francisco anyway because parking is lousy everywhere. LayKoon is incredibly hospitable and provided me a little tour upon arrival even I didn't arrive until around 10pm. She even messaged me when I inadvertently parked in front of her garage rather than just having me towed. Awesome spot. If you stay here check out the DKG Deli too. 
3506164,86031585,2016-07-14,66764538,Blake,It was gorgeous and in a great area. Very homey and a good price. Would stay here again.
25432313,321938974,2018-09-11,30525308,Jennifer,"Yijia‘s house is in a great location just 2 blocks away from the next tram stop and a street full of restaurants a 7/11 supermarket and a laundromat. Within 20-25 minutes you are in downtown.
The room is clean and check in is easy. Communication was great. I‘d recommend this room anytime."
13022232,154702954,2017-05-25,121355823,Charlotte,"Peihong is the kindest person and really makes you feel at home. She was an amazing host! Her house is about a 15-20 minute bus ride to mission district and the bus station is 3-5 mins away. 
Our room was clean and modern and the house felt safe. 
You are allowed to use her kitchen and washing machine which was great. 
I would definitely recommend staying at Peihongs place. "
22568473,234697684,2018-02-13,43578064,Cynthia,As advertised this was a comfortable interesting place.  I loved being with the family and the friendly cat Bindi.  It was a quick walk to a large grocery store bus stop and GG Park.  Thank you Robin and family!
10502323,125784882,2017-01-07,2508810,Angela,My family and I had a wonderful experience at Katie and Chuck's place. Everything was just about perfect: nice neighborhood very clean and spacious apartment extremely welcoming and friendly hosts and everything we needed in the house. We stayed for ten days and we felt right at home. Absolutely recommended.
7247351,65591750,2016-03-15,11301051,Aaron,Shauna is such a nice and accommodating host. The neighborhood was very quiet and plenty of parking.  It has your own private entrance and a place to sit outside near the fire pit (but it was raining all weekend unfortunately!) The listing was very accurate with closet space a comfy couch turned bed humidifier heater and very clean bathroom. Great WiFi and love the maps and tourist books set aside. The water snacks and fruit was also a wonderful touch! Thank you Shauna!
17811571,559283192,2019-11-03,71272009,Katherine,Anna's place is clean and very private. Parking is no issue space was provided directly in front of the apartment a huge plus. Bus stops were very accessible within a couple of blocks. It takes a bit of time to get into the city center but that it to be expected. There are some nice local bars/coffee shops within a few blocks of Anna's place in Bernal Heights (we liked Holy Water) and if you feel like taking a stroll the Mission is less than two miles away. The apartment was stocked with food/snacks as well which was very thoughtful. We especially appreciated so many vegan offerings (protein/snack bars non-dairy milk plum jam etc). Very appreciated. I would definitely stay at Anna's the next time I visit SF.
4464347,123509750,2016-12-29,66880341,Estee,The place was great for my 6 days in SanFran. A very confortable living space. The hostel arranges many events to help guests interact with each other which was a great thing though I did not participate in them this time around. Employees were also very helpful and friendly. All in all a very nice hostel to stay in.
17482888,246085467,2018-03-24,34523228,Michael,Simply AMAZING location. Felt safe the whole stay and Vincent was a great host.
5998790,413579870,2019-02-17,57689723,Abhi,Ewa’s place is at a good location. Close to public transportation and lot of dinning options.
1725853,26988006,2015-02-23,432934,Ryan,Alex was there to greet me and show me the apartment. It lives up to its description in that it is all modern and very spacious and clean. It is a place that is designed for guests so it has all amenities and everything is up to date. It is very private and has a nice garden entrance. The beds and bedding were very comfortable. The area was convenient for my needs but a somewhat remote neighborhood. Very close to golden gate park though. Parking was available on the street but a lot easier with a small car. 
21057777,477711736,2019-06-28,92523249,Anthony,Tiffany’s place was just as advertised! It was the perfect place to stay for a few days to truly be able to explore San Francisco! I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the city.
593165,46044298,2015-09-07,42473959,Maxime,Perfect location 15 minutes tram to downtown. Very nice place clean and spacious. Hassle free check in and check useful tips for parking in the neighborhood.. Recommend the grocery round the corner. We'll be back.
1995487,18312123,2014-08-25,16846191,Shaun,Michael and Enzo where great hosts and where really helpful recommending places to eat and how to get around. It was the perfect place to start my holiday! Wouldn't hesitate in coming back or recommending it a the perfect place to stay in the mission! 
7729217,96682780,2016-08-23,90704693,Noelle,The  neighborhood was an extraordinarily quiet and pleasant getaway spot still very close to vibrant shopping and entertainment areas. Even if we were out late and had to find a parking spot a ways off the walk was really pleasant and pretty. Glenn could not have been more welcoming with snacks water wine rides and even laundry access. We loved the clean airy bath with skylight and the view over the pretty patio.
657121,494163797,2019-07-23,247055062,Nicholas,Trevor was very nice and accommodating. Place was absolutely beautiful with an AMAZING view. Close to lots of great things.  Overall a great experience.
7344289,172741559,2017-07-21,135749574,Kristin,Very clean and comfortable with beautiful back alley patio. Many good restaurants and stores close by. Walking distance to park but need to drive or take bus to access the downtown  part of city. The hosts left manual with  a lot of suggestions of places to eat things to do and ways to get around. Highly recommend.
748256,6864501,2013-08-28,4401738,Toby & Ilo,Awesome place in the heart of the Misson District. Bathroom to share with another Airbnb-room brand-new and totally clean better than most hotels! The bedroom has lots of space for clothing and bags the bed is also wonderful. Definately a 5 Star place! Thanks Michael and Yesica for hosting us :)
437385,304531899,2018-08-09,144278661,Lee-Ann Claire,We had the most wonderful stay at Melanie’s beautiful apartment. The location was great and her attention to detail in making us feel comfortable on ever level was  so appreciated!
1030352,42750470,2015-08-15,39288621,Roshan,Great house in a great location! Everything u need! The beds were super comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. The only slightly negative thing is that the lighting was not so great in the evening. Overall a great experience! We would definitely stay here again!
23044309,406470499,2019-01-29,38114230,Devin,Private suite was beautiful clean and in close walking distance to the Castro and public transportation. We had rented a car and the  street parking was easy to find so no problems there. Overall had a great time in San Francisco and would recommend this suite to anyone.
21645603,439837203,2019-04-19,109254832,Natalia,I absolutely recommend Phyllis’s place if you visit San Francisco. Everything works perfect the beds are very comfortable the place absolutely clean and it is easy to move around. I am very glad we chose this place to stay. We were there for a whole week and I could have stayed longer :-D
4902729,133950980,2017-02-25,115944726,Vanessa,Was pleasantly surprised and happy with my visit. After living in SF for years and finally coming back it made me feel at home. Genuine SF location and building. The TL is not for everyone to stay but I loved it. I would definitely return to this unit
7902889,85830310,2016-07-13,21987483,Estève,"Michael was nice and flexible with my arrival time.

A few things though: 
1- there is no washing machine facility included in the price. There is one available in the basement with dryer but I had to pay 4.25$ extra (in quarters) for that (1.5$ to wash and 1.25$ to dry)
2- it is a couch in a loft with no separate room for Michael and his girlfriend; only a mezzanine. The living room is also the kitchen which is also the vestibule which is also - somehow - their room too. I insist because it means that there is very little privacy for anyone. 
3- the corners of the bathroom and living room floor were dusty and I made the mistake to leave clothes on the floor while having a shower.
4- I couldn't find anything to dry the mugs and bowl I used so I had to let them in the sink. 
These make me think that the couch is overpriced compared to what exists in San Francisco.

Otherwise the location is great and close to transportation. The flat is quiet - even with open windows - while the area is busy. The bathtub and sink were clean and bathroom was nice to use. The light in the living room is good and the couch rather comfortable (it is about 1.5 person sized
- no more). The interior design is exactly what is on the pictures. Wifi worked perfectly. Michael had also left umbrellas and a map of the BART for me to use in case which was nice and thoughtful. "
9593505,342482391,2018-10-28,9599595,Star,"This is an exceptional apartment. It is spacious and comfortable and very well situated with great walks around Mission and great restaurants and groceries! We loved it. Angie always answered me immediately and thoughtfully. Getting in and out was a breeze! It was exactly as promised but living it was even better than dreaming about it! 
Thank you Angie!"

25463,7397996,2013-09-18,7529040,Sarah,I had a wonderful stay at Patrick's house in lower Haight. I just want to echo all the reviews below. The location of the house ideal! The house was very clean and elegantly furnished. Thanks again hope to stay again in the future!
27454459,464081531,2019-06-04,71677841,Roberto,Bella posizione in un bel quartiere vicino all oceano comodissimo per aereo porto e centro San Francisco stanza ben tenuta silenziosa
9489347,147037487,2017-04-24,21532414,Louise,We had a great stay. The place was just as advertised. We never met Rob but his instructions to access the unit were clear. For us the location was great. He kindly left us some fresh-roasted coffee beans and a bottle of wine. 
2455325,17190571,2014-08-08,795614,Jason,Great place. Next time we stay in SF we'll be staying here.
63247,14737427,2014-06-25,14794076,Emily,"My husband and I spent 6 days here for our anniversary. The location was very convenient and the studio itself was as lovely as the photos show--no odd surprises or inconveniences; very clean. 
Temperature was perfect for us..the window opens to help keep it cool and the curtains block the light from making the room too warm during the day. 
Anne was friendly and offered to answer any questions we had...check in/out was clear and straightforward. 
Overall It was a perfect place to retire from a long day of walking/sightseeing. 
We'd go back and recommend it to other couples. "
5581254,153284978,2017-05-20,98249143,Alena,Kesinee and her family are very friendly and did so much to help us feel comfortable during our stay. The location was in a safe and cute neighborhood and there were lots of small cafes and shops to explore in the area. We had a great stay and Kesinee is a super cool host I would definitely stay here again!
39487901,571091466,2019-11-30,294177620,Kati,My fiancé and I had a great stay at Ryan’s place! We brought our dog with us as well (lab-size) and the spacious apartment didn’t make us feel crammed at all. He got a parking spot in the garage right before our stay which was nice as we drove up from SoCal. We arrived around 1am but Ryan sent great instructions on how to get into the building/apartment.  The building is very modern and has a small dog park near the alleyway. There’s also a gym which was a bonus! The neighborhood is safe and there’s a Trader Joes and some other shops nearby. The apartment is a short drive away from the main tourist attractions (the bridge Land’s End Painted Ladies etc.) but we didn’t have any trouble finding parking/meters. Overall no complaints and a perfect stay!
87640,48522263,2015-09-27,16503414,Julia,Really nice place comfortable all renewed and awesome garden. Karin was a very attentive host and made us feel at home: wine in the fridge and chocolate from Ghirardelli! The neighbourhood is quiet and safe near to trendy Mission and Castro and it just takes 15 minutes to arrive to downtown by Muni. I certainly reccomend it to enjoy San Francisco.
748222,35646834,2015-06-21,12283034,Christoph,We had a great time at Michael's and Yesica's beautiful apartment. It is the ideal base to explore San Francisco. The only thing you gotta do is listen to what the two of them tell you. Breakfast places dinner restaurants hikes bike tours - go where and do what they tell you and you will have a blast. :-) Thank you again Michael and Yesica it was so nice meeting you we'll be back... Chris and Juli
10035487,163921897,2017-06-25,15401603,Lydia,Terrific place! Clean comfortable great location. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend it!
148627,81723582,2016-06-24,27028933,Joris,"Mooi en super schoon appartement. Voldoende ruimte en ziet er precies zo uit als op de foto's. De waterdruk in de douche is inderdaad erg zwak waardoor douchen lang duurt. De voordeur is erg oud en krakkemikkig onveilig zag het er uit. Mark heeft super veel goede tips voor eten en uitgaan! We hadden dit appartement geboekt omdat je gratis kan parkeren en er een achtertuin/patio is. De parkeerplaats was niet beschikbaar omdat deze van de buurman is en alleen beschikbaar als hij buiten de stad is. Op straat moet je elke 2 uur de auto verplaatsen dus ook geen optie. Uiteindelijk hebben we bij een motel om de hoek kunnen parkeren voor $10 per dag. 
Er zijn op dit moment grote bouwwerkzaamheden in het pand. Dit appartement is de enige ruimte in het huis dat af is de rest wordt flink aan gewerkt tussen 7.00 - 16.00 uur. Het zag er serieus uit en gaat nog maanden duren (misschien wel jaren). De patio/achtertuin konden we niet gebruiken omdat er een steiger stond die de achterdeur blokkeerde. Mark was in het begin niet bereikbaar en stuurde later een sms. Nadat ik geld terug heb gevraagd hebben we van Mark 50% korting op de 2e nacht gekregen. Dat was netjes en snel afgehandeld maar liever een parkeerplek en patio om te gebruiken.. Locatie is super leuke restaurants op Chesnut Street. "
16844534,329355989,2018-09-28,4965433,Simran,"We really enjoyed our stay at Vincenzo & Brandi's lovely apartment which was spacious clean and true to the description provided. We were welcomed with kitchen essentials (milk bread cheese chocolates & more!) and a bottle of wine! They provided printed information on things we could do in the neighborhood & were very responsive to our questions via texts which was really helpful. 

We would definitely recommend staying at this apartment...we had a very positive experience!"
4439461,38820186,2015-07-19,29169867,David,Probablemente uno de los mejores sitios para alojarte en San Francisco. Un buen barrio al lado de la calle Fillmore (tiendas restaurantes...) y bien comunicado con el centro y Castro. La habitación fue excepcional (como en la foto) muy limpia y silenciosa. El baño impecable. Y los anfitriones (viven en la puerta de al lado no compartes casa con ellos) muy educados amables y serviciales. Te ayudan en todo lo que necesitas si les preguntas. Volveríamos sin ninguna duda una gran experiencia!!!
21122475,468577962,2019-06-12,3841767,Jun,"Laura’s place is very centrally located. However it’s an old
building and the lift wasn’t working  we had to drag suitcase all the way to the top floor. Also there was no hot water for a day due to building maintenance. Also there are 3 rooms with around 4 guests + the host  sharing the bathroom. It would be a queue."
5749839,227550714,2018-01-15,167849495,Leyna,The host canceled this reservation 161 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14936250,149745569,2017-05-05,32870302,Noelle,Kathy was very communicative and the space was very comfortable and clean. I typically stay in the Mission District for work but this was very close to BART and easy to get back and forth. 
4252808,329770729,2018-09-29,50598599,Grace,We had an amazing stay at Heathers apartment. After an 11 hour flight from the UK parking was straight outside and check in easy with Heather greeting us (the pets were super cute too!).  The apartment was spotless and stylish and the bottle of wine was a lovely added bonus! great location across from the beach. We would 100% stay here again. Thanks Heather xx
13021568,81674741,2016-06-24,16877112,Jennifer,Super sweet host. She made me coffee in the morning!! It was a bit farther out of the city than I wanted but the bathtub was totally worth it. Not the most comfortable bed. I'd stay there again.
87640,657703,2011-10-24,1121230,Ade,Karin's place is perfect. Waking up to a lush garden view was lovely. Very convenient to great restaurants and cafes. When I return to San Francisco I'd definitely stay at her place again.

22011446,522218600,2019-09-01,130130060,John,The Canterbury was centrally located and easy to get anywhere in and around the city using Uber and Lyft.  The room had all necessary amenities and was clean. The property was well managed and felt very safe.  I would use this property again for future visits.
2488520,47356402,2015-09-18,22842174,Carrie,Gabe's home was amazing. Absolutely perfect set-up for our needs and had everything we needed.  Getting in and out was super easy with codes provided.  Gabe was easy to communicate and super helpful letting us know what was in the area and responsive to me throughout my stay!! 
4782281,133615705,2017-02-23,25265036,David,"Place had an excellent location and was very clean.  Walking distance to the Castro Mission and NOE neighborhoods.  

However basic needs like a working fridge and soap weren't met.  The host also didn't respond to messages until the morning of the day we left.  He did refund us $ for our complaints.  "
982298,102284480,2016-09-17,75293506,Kelly,Very laid back neighborhood.  Beautiful view of the beach.  Plenty of room in the house.  Home is aging a little and could use some TLC but overall we loved the location and having all the space.  I had my two adult children on vacation with me and we all had our own space and could cook breakfast and a few dinners while there.  Close to Golden Gate park and other amenities.  Parking was never a problem.
29416324,366512495,2019-01-02,36246661,Joshua,Very affordable convenient place to stay near downtown.  The room was as described.  Alice was very responsive and excellent at communicating.
20762414,233235459,2018-02-08,1433118,Rachel,Nadyas place was more then expected. Safe lovely neighborhood. Comfortable spacious home. Everything was better then  a five star hotel. Clean comfortable bright windows. When we arrived late having food and wine maps and guides to plan our day was amazing. And a jetted tub! My friends and I were traveling the coast and this is by far the best place we stayed in. Best time I have had in San Fran.
6505426,94121819,2016-08-14,16472778,Michela,"Great staying at Jeff and Huib! The house was perfectly located and even nicer than the pictures thanks to the perfectly equipped house and to the charming atmisphere we really felt at ""home""!

4518031,493592581,2019-07-22,31985791,Maria,It's a wonderful place for people that is travel alone; you will make new friends easily. Free food is available some days (thanks for that!!) activities are always available facilities as sunscreen bike parking sauna are also offered to us. Just keep in mind that the place has a very particular smell (no so good!!) and elevator are not availables (this count if you have heavy suitcases)  overall I recommend it.
13784076,311634090,2018-08-21,172500430,Manuel,Place was great and her mother was very nice.
18757990,174701804,2017-07-26,137707732,Ryan,I had a great stay here. Neighborhood is quiet but still has easy access to great restaurants stores etc. The room is very nice - good bed large desk/work area great bathroom with steam shower and coffee maker. There's a separate street entrance with automated door locks so you don't have to worry about keys. Last ÜT not least Aaron and Erica are great hosts and we're very quick to respond to any questions I had. Thanks for a great stay. 
12522,17040463,2014-08-06,7048318,Lisa,I have been for a week in the home of Brenda. the house is beautiful with attention to every detail clean. It is the  home of my dreams!

3720392,219936980,2017-12-19,5905713,Maya,Kelly was very responsive and very helpful. The Orange Studio was very bright spacious clean and private with nice amenities. A great spot and very convenient if you're looking for somewhere close to UCSF or golden gate park.

1106534,44406060,2015-08-26,333134,Idan,"Rachel's lovely cottage was a lovely home base for my family on our vacation. Up the hill from Noe we had magnificent views every time we ventured out into the neighborhood which was quiet and extremely friendly. The essentials were nearby and the Muni 35 took us down to Castro and Market many days.

The house feels like a big wooden ship or a treehouse — warm and full of light with a quirky layout and plenty of amenities. Rachel was a phenomenal host making us feel right at home and taking care of the odd request or question. Overall our stay was like an AirBnB commercial — just bring good walking shoes and be prepared for the hills!"
1855096,44677433,2015-08-28,13450396,Pierre,Check-in was excellent and very welcoming. The flat is fantastic and in a great location on Potrero Hill close to great cafes and restaurants. I would stay again!

Tiene toda clase de detalles de lujo desde las toallas o los productos del baño hasta los utensilios de cocina.
Situada en un barrio muy agradable y tranquilo."
1333047,71325377,2016-04-24,31926826,Melody,Graham was a great host and we thoroughly enjoyed our time in San Francisco! The room was spacious clean and conveniently located to all the Mission has to offer. He even accommodated some of our friends who came to visit.

4616596,254672615,2018-04-17,45649802,Sakura,I had a great stay at Jen’s studio.  Although it’s located at the heart of Mission with busy streets of bars and restaurants near by Jen’s place was incredibly peaceful and quiet with a beautiful backyard attached.  Jen was very responsive and attentive and I could get her help every time I reached out very quickly.  Big bonus is that an adorable kitty pays visits in the backyard - I really enjoyed hanging out with the kitty too. Highly recommended!

6922612,46223185,2015-09-08,14602168,Amrita,The place exceeded my high expectations. The space was much larger than I expected and the bathroom was recently renovated. Most importantly the view from the balcony was spectacular! I could see all the way from the Golden Gate Bridge to the north the the Bay in the east. Great value for the price!
8048653,63675665,2016-02-25,59167596,Chao,Nice place and friendly hosts Emanuel and Eric provided us a clean and well furnished space and during our stay they tried a lot to help us to solve the problem. If next time back to SF definitely will stay here again.

2356554,192088353,2017-09-09,64456310,Scott,Very clean and Tatiana was super responsive to a few questions. Parking is a nightmare as the street is very skinny with limited spots. Try parking your car during business hours and then ubering. Safe and quiet neighborhood.
7896925,286234944,2018-07-05,195444805,Rebecca,This place is lovely! It's in a great location and was very clean and comfortable. Elaina was a responsive and helpful host.

12607119,456850259,2019-05-22,15746076,Arthur,Julie's home was spectacular and beautifully decorated. It was spacious and is located in a beautiful area of San Francisco within a 5 minute walk of the beautiful Palace of Fine Arts. The house was spacious and clean can't go wrong with this great house in a great city.
493889,203837466,2017-10-15,113599448,Daniela,Das Appartement ist geschmackvoll und nützlich eingerichtet. Es ist großzügig und sehr hell. Es ist alles vorhanden das für den Alltag gebraucht wird. Das Bett ist sehr bequem. Die Aussicht ist phantastisch tagsüber über das ganze Tal nachts hat man den Eindruck im Sternenhimmel zu sein. Man kann den Sonnenaufgang und den Sonnenuntergang sehen und genießen. Die BART-Station Glenpark ist in ein paar Gehminuten zu erreichen (es gibt auch die Möglichkeit den Bus zu nehmen). Die Fahrt dauert nur 10 Minuten nach Downtown.  Ein Safeway und der Canyon Market sind in Gehdistanz vorhanden. Die Umgebung ist jederzeit sicher auch für Alleinreisende.
13749078,567151295,2019-11-21,117513673,Matthew,Simon was an excellent easy to communicate with and was informative. Seem less book and stay! Thanks again.
31516192,491168505,2019-07-19,11495272,Glenn,The guitar room is mostly what you’d expect! A room in a shared flat with clean towels and some quirky design. I’d rent again when in need of a quick stay!
18088837,177143701,2017-08-01,9552762,Gerardo,El alojamiento es impecable y lujoso todo funciona perfecto y la vista es magnifica. Mas de lo qué esperábamos.
5749181,455592962,2019-05-19,214824639,Charlie,Great experience. All the basics I needed. It should be noted that this studio is within a private residence. To get to the studio you will enter through their garage and walk through their laundry room. This was not an issue but was not what I was expecting. Again the space itself and the location are superb but the way you enter the space is a bit different than what I am use to for an Airbnd.
114401,5631056,2013-07-08,6529872,Miriam,What a great first time AirBnB experience!   I'm ALWAYS going to travel this way.  George was so gracious and helpful when I arrived.   His place was welcoming and so cool after a drive from 100+ weather.   I loved sitting out on his balcony with the kitty and taking in the view.  Parking was a bit of a chore then again that's San Francisco for you.  I highly recommend this spot for the single traveler looking to explore the city.  Can't wait to visit George and Kuma (the wonder kitty) again.  
2209751,451424911,2019-05-11,68933890,Alison,Jason is an excellent host! In Australia we would call him a top bloke. He’s as informative and engaging as you want him to be. I would have a chit-chat with him at the end of most days when I returned to his place and get nuggets of information on where to go what to look out for what to avoid - the best when it comes from a SF local. His home is neat as a pin and decorated beautifully. It is very convenient. I bought a 1-week MUNI pass and used it to travel on public transport (buses trams cable cars and trains - not BART). Highly recommend Jason’s place.
8859249,291929862,2018-07-16,964494,Artemis,Erika and Gary have really put some thoughtful effort into the design of this gorgeous little space. The location is an easy Lyft into SF and we loved being across the street from the park. Erika went out of her way suggesting fun activities for us while we were there. I appreciated all these touches.
7022309,111299518,2016-10-30,101618416,Tee,This host is a lovely warm gracious accommodating woman. The accommodations were great. The neigorhood is lovely especially if you are used to city noises like a bus stop. The homes are beautiful victorians with character and lots of nice woodwork. 
9471416,261600727,2018-05-06,136496976,Miriam,Maria's place was warm and inviting. The room was clean and cozy. Maria was also super prompt at responding to us. We will definitely book again with her.
18639196,200838890,2017-10-06,130336130,Carlos,The hosts have everything set up so you can be very independent and provide all kinds of extras in addition to it just being a beautiful clean space. Very convenient to public transportation and very comfortable to stay in.
580106,406207861,2019-01-28,22214734,Christos,"Ari’s private room is extremely spacious and very clean. It’s quite a large house overall so privacy in the room is not a problem.

Location is convenient and the neighbourhood is clean + safe.

Check-in/out was seamless & Ari was super helpful/quick to respond via message.

Would stay here again."
27699796,495937215,2019-07-26,12655576,Michael,Genevieve’s place is the perfect location if you are looking for the classic San Francisco row house experience. Located just three blocks from the middle of Castro Street and three or so blocks south of Market you can get anywhere in the city easily. We are walkers and walked through the Castro all the way down Market to the Ferry Building and west to Golden Gate Park. Great restaurants close and a French bakery across the street. The condominium is tastefully decorated with comfortable beds terraces front and rear and a large fully equipped kitchen. We felt truly a part of the fabulous quilt that is San Francisco.
8459807,277151321,2018-06-15,168456846,WooSung,He is great. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We can lock the room so our privacy is protected. His kitchen is very useful. Everything was great 
5559608,439320811,2019-04-18,206306220,Kyle,This was a great place to stay. Worked perfectly for my needs.
8869806,190690802,2017-09-04,3267899,Jessica Pearl,Nathan's place is very charming and sits in an awesome location. Plenty of cool cafes delis bars restaurants and convenience shops near by. The place is perfect for a couple or group of 3. He was nice enough to provide a blow up mattress and extra bedding. We were happily surprised to be provided coffee breakfast and snacks!

The room is exactly as it looks in the pictures and is a great value. The location is superb. Just walk around the corner and you're at a street with some great restaurants and cute coffeehouses. There's also a park/ hill nearby you can walk to and get great views of the city. We had a wonderful experience staying here.

17592480,227423445,2018-01-14,53832134,Apaksh,Albert & Tiffany's place happened to be my first ever Airbnb experience and although I was a bit doubtful about how it will pan out they both made sure it was spectacular. They are wonderful hosts very very communicative and they have a really lovely house. Albert also guided me through the city and things to do apart from connecting on our professional lives. Great stay!
9882716,62754458,2016-02-16,24047170,Philip,Donnas apartment was clean spacious and close to so many great places.  The garden patio was a big plus.  She was a terrific host and made our short stay delightful.

36078299,490522583,2019-07-18,120718404,Ayelesha,"Winnie Sau's place is one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at. The stay is extremely hospitable and homey. The host is very diligent in preparing you for your stay before I came the host emailed me a Word doc with a detailed itinerary explaining the way to check in the amenities any concerns one could have and a break down of the rules. 
I really appreciated that every guest is required to take off their shoes first which they then provide you with sandals to slide on. The cabinets in the kitchen are labeled they provide access to fruit granola and dishwear. The rooms have little chocolates next to the bed and on the desk (soooo cute AND the good chocolate too haha). Everything is so clean and organized. They allow access to the common quarters and provide board games under the tv. The living room has a pretty epic view of San Francisco and the ocean blue colored walls have nice calming effects in my opinion ;)
More importantly when I reached out to the host with a concern or question I was met with a speedy quick response in real time and genuine concern from the host. 
This Airbnb and the wonderful hosts are super accommodating and I feel like for being in San Francisco and for the amenities and [simple luxury] I feel it comes with the price almost feels like a steal!"
31569484,432080136,2019-04-02,242834860,Katherine,I had a wonderful and comfortable experience at my stay in Leon's Airbnb. The hosts are very friendly and helpful. The perfect cozy room for my week long stay.
12026856,409114560,2019-02-06,240557725,Kamran,Everything was just perfect!  Thank you!
1393654,24152591,2014-12-21,21339934,子阳,The neighbourhood is very quiet. But it's a little bit far from downtown. Kevin is a very kind person. Breakfast is provided here and we can use the computer and printer during daytime. 
3116428,75967463,2016-05-23,32957650,Janice,Wonderful apartment in a great little neighborhood!  Although Krzysztof was not in the country he was very responsive -- even sending a friend of his to fix the internet that went down.  The bed was comfy and the apartment was very quiet.  A really lovely bright stylish refuge!  Thanks.
15339049,491857022,2019-07-20,186527254,Tom,This was our third stop during a NoCal honeymoon.  We were aware it was in proximity to Haight-Ashbury but didn’t realize how it bordered on Hayes Valley and the Castro—both terrific neighborhoods with great dining (and a bit cleaner and safer than The Haight).  The home is clean functional well-maintained and smartly decorated.  A garage is a huge bonus anywhere in San Fran.  All along the process Rosellen Elliot and Otis communicated effectively with us and were totally professionals as renters.  Don’t hesitate to rent from them should you feel this apartment fits your needs!
3433930,190976503,2017-09-05,38380843,Melanie,I visited during a heat wave and Paul and Tom were very considerate providing a fan and bottled water also inviting me to hang out on the main floor where it was a bit cooler.  Overall the space was clean and private.  I'd stay there again on my next visit!

271647,4464936,2013-05-06,2766691,Melanie,Matt was available by phone so we could touch base before my arrival since he was going to be gone.  Although he wasn't sure whether his roommates would be there or not one was and she was very nice.  Bed was really comfortable for my daughter and me.  Small room but comfortable.
16204265,461562091,2019-05-31,36579716,Namho,Everything was great! Pokey the dog is super friendly - I wish I stayed few more days. Koncha is super friendly and accomodating.

11104122,244819907,2018-03-19,62947108,Derek,This beautiful home is located in the perfect spot to be away from busy city life but at the same time just a few steps away - literally! Perched on the hilltop with tasteful decor original art pieces and well thought amenities I almost didn't want to leave the entire time I was there! The beds are extremely comfortable and will offer you a well deserved nights rest after exploring the many popular neighbourhoods around. The hospitality that they provide far exceeds my expectations and I left there with a heavy heart hoping to return sooner than later. If you are looking for the perfect place stop here... BOOK NOW!
17237993,247481640,2018-03-28,176288227,Debrissa,This is a great location to catch the bus from. Also you're a short walk from the BART station!!

33999573,560744115,2019-11-07,126924972,Christine,The place was great! Perfectly clean and so pretty. Good distance from downtown and walking to the beach and cafes/coffee shops. Only thing was that we heard absolutely everything upstairs (not a big deal but might be if you like to sleep in). Other than that it was absolutely perfect!
26259702,328277292,2018-09-25,9619970,Warren,Annette is a fantastic host. The space is wonderful clean private and filled with thoughtful touches. When I checked in I was offered a glass of wine and walkthrough of the space and all the amenities. Looking forward to my stay here!

27735398,357576040,2018-12-10,223008686,Harry,Nice location clean modern furnishings. Room was chilly with only a cheap inefficient space heater. Bathroom was frigid. Host was non responsive and cold like her room. No amenities. Will never recommend this Airbnb.

648086,448028577,2019-05-04,141117138,Dominik,"Ponge ist ein großartiger Gastgeber sehr zuvorkommend und hat viele Tips für seine Gäste. Das Haus das Zimmer und das Bad sind super. Alles ist sauber das Bett ist sehr bequem und es ist ruhig. 
Die Gegend in der Ponge lebt ist sehr einladend nur wenige Meter entfernt findet man eine Bushaltestelle mit der Linie 24 ist man schnell und unkompliziert in der Innenstadt. 
Auch die kleine ""Einkaufsstraße"" ist super schön. Es gibt viele kleine Läden und Restaurants. Alles ist einladend sicher und sauber.

Wir werden auf jeden Fall erneut nach SF kommen und dann auch wieder bei Ponge wohnen. 

Super klasse vielen Dank!"

I will definitely stay again the next time I’m in San Francisco :)
8763620,85848267,2016-07-13,36547453,Rick,It was a great experience.  I met several people and three solid business contacts.  It was a good vibe among all the guests and very safe.   Excellent location.  Just a short walk to 24th street and some wonderful places.
20267540,484919727,2019-07-09,266377135,Sidney,Gabriella made it feel like we were staying at a friends house! She was super easy to talk to and made us feel right at home!

4321720,106701943,2016-10-07,85336305,Hanna,Novita and Michael- and their cute little dog Max- were amazing hosts! The listing description was more than accurate and the neighborhood is adorable and has great spots to eat and relax. The listing is very easy accessible- with a bus stop to downtown just a block away! I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone who is looking for a spot to stay in SF because it's way more fun than staying in a hotel. Best first Airbnb stay I could ask for!

Would stay here again!
21578559,540024000,2019-10-02,5944713,Theresa,5 stars from location to cleanliness. Jeff is very detail oriented and leaves no stone unturned when it comes to communication. In addition the valet parking option is completely worth the $38.00.
19476963,276090697,2018-06-12,142641698,Valentina,"Really close to a BART stop and super cheap with uber for go in the city.

This Airbnb was great;  you are gonna find everything you need inside; the host provided us with toothbrushes and toothpaste too! 
Clean and comfortable. Cheaper compared to the  prices of other places in San Francisco."
499096,415435761,2019-02-22,6098298,John,"Ingrid place may be small but it is cozy has a a firm/comfortable bed and anything you really need (in fact I had meant to make use of the hotplate for eggs more often but there is so many good places to eat I only cooked once all week). She even left out some snacks fruit and some homemade crackers which were delicious.
The space is in a quiet safe part of the hood. But Mission is an incredible neighborhood. There's all the great new flashy stuff but the rough around the edges original hood is amazing - restaurants art community events. I highly recommend exploring it all.
Then a quick stroll to Delores park to hop on the tram downtown or a walk up to 24th for the BART that gets to/from the airport in about 30 min.
I would love to come back when I return to SF!"
21058406,260694245,2018-05-04,151097020,Ben,"We enjoyed our stay at Ulrich's home. Ulrich is very precise and very carefull about its place with detailled rules. As a result the place is very clean nicely decorated so you could feel at home. The room is next to the street so you can heard some buses climbing hills in the mourning but it's hard to avoid in SF :)
Location is perfect to enjoy a nice stay. Ulrich is very reactive about everything.
We really enjoyed our stay."

The location was perfect!
A few blocks in either direction from the front stoop took us to great places and transportation was easy whether we opted to walk Uber or to rent bikes. 
Whenever we saw our hosts we were always greeted warmly asked if everything was going well or if we needed anything which was greatly appreciated. 
Julian gave us some great suggestions throughout our stay and he even took the time to get us on the right CalTrain one night (saving us time and money)! Very hospitable and sweet hosts!"

They made our stay outstanding and provided us with a spotless place to relax and unwind on our holiday.
2042095,174035015,2017-07-24,3888612,Allyson,A beautifully decorated and well appointed home in a quiet spot away from the hustle and bustle but still a quick jaunt to major spots.

Maria provided instruction on where to find the key etc so everything went very smoothly.  No hitches whatsoever.  The home is lovely and the room quiet.  Our paths didn't cross until I was leaving in the morning and we chatted briefly.  A throughly charming person.   I would definitely come back.

15010218,436296330,2019-04-12,148603568,Ken,"Rob (the host) was very thoughtful. He was available to accommodate me whether it was late or earlier than the check-in time. He also offered to hold my luggage before my flight which I thought was very kind of him. The location is walking distance to the BART it is also a safe neighborhood. Rob's place is clean and I like the ""no shoes"" inside the house policy because I do the same at home. I would stay again in his place if it's available next time I visit."
5253439,439284406,2019-04-18,252141926,Kumiko,Nice place to experience the area and to save money. The hosts are friendly and happy to give you advice how to enjoy SF by renting bicycle etc.

Very nice and clean room in one of the most beautiful quarters of San Francisco. Also the public transport to the center was close and fast. I can absolutely recommend this offer!

1301798,243658053,2018-03-16,7176806,Chetna,My stay at Yong's place was good. The location is great close to a BART station and there are many restaurants and cafes in the area (Yong sent me a long list with recommendations that was great thank you Yong!). The room was bigger than expected so it was nice to have that little extra space. The only negative thing about my stay was that it got a little cold in the room. However I am sure that Yong would have had an extra blanket if I had asked.
7548762,220108464,2017-12-20,23657868,Angela,Amazing space in a great location. Close to Market St Union Square & the Powell BART station. Very clean through & through helpful staff would absolutely recommend for budget conscious travelers.

3416013,25918772,2015-01-29,20543748,Arif,Emily was a wonderful host and her house is fantastic. She was very welcoming and friendly. I was there for only one day and Emily took me out to show me the neighborhood and also helped me find a good place for dinner. Everything was just perfect about the house i.e. great downtown view ideal location modern look and furniture comfortable bed. She also prepared lovable breakfast for me in the morning. I'd love to stay again in Emily's house whenever I visit San Francisco next. Thank you Emily.
20575733,254934188,2018-04-18,56446789,Leh-Leng,Room and private bathroom was clean. Located near shops and restaurants. Used uber to get to main attractions but this wasn't a problem as fares were quite reasonable.
10469182,495237202,2019-07-25,249286499,Anthony,Overwhelming service and support from Landy. She clearly went above and beyond my expectations but also respected our privacy/vacation. She was extremely responsive to messages and genuinely tried to make our experience (at her place and in her city) as enjoyable as possible. I highly recommend using her if you’re traveling to the area. You won’t be disappointed and the unit is adorably tucked away and private!!
4728615,96013431,2016-08-21,53056083,Connor,Most of the other reviews are spot on.  Location is good and you get what you pay for.  No frills but a decent spot at a decent price (which is hard to find in the city).

10251,90653809,2016-08-01,21064741,Bjorn,Great home and location! Prefect stay for a weekend getaway. Out flight ended up being delayed in the evening and we didn't arrive until later than planned and Roman was there to meet us with the keys and show us the place. Additionally I left a pair of sunglasses after checking out and he was quick to ship them to my home in Seattle. Thanks again for the great hospitality!
491867,19968673,2014-09-21,20671110,Claudia,Sona's home was great! We weren't sure what to expect as it was our fist time using airbnb but it really was exactly as the pictures showed. It was walking distance to a lot of great spots and the suggestions made were very helpful. We hope to be able to go back soon as it was a great experience.
35917405,528269234,2019-09-12,107354891,Liam,Great place. Would recommend.
2093695,21803419,2014-10-24,7917354,Linda,Received a welcome reception from Jennifer who was gardening out front when I walked to the house.  I know San Francisco somewhat but it was nice to explore the little neighborhood of Ingleside.  I found the apartment.  The combination of separate external entrance semi-private bath and nice big windows looking out onto the garden made this location perfect for my needs.

30513863,489421809,2019-07-16,6727932,Gillian,Thanks Geoff for your help we had a great stay in San Fransisco
2592518,182514803,2017-08-14,31597344,Ashley,Daniel was a fantastic communicator and the apartment was absolutely divine. The location is very central enabling for quick and easy transportation throughout the city. I would definitely recommend this apartment to a friend in the future.
231752,5258398,2013-06-21,5695680,Hailee,Wow! What an incredible stay in this adorable spot. LeighAnna was a wonderful host and our stay went off without a hitch! Looking forwarding to coming back to SF and staying here again. 
4896087,27478411,2015-03-05,21085895,Jason,The apartment was clean and in a pretty area of SF as long as you don't mind the hills.  Would certainly stay again.
1110787,245555798,2018-03-22,12566067,Alexis,Amanda's apartment is in the ideal location right off of Fillmore street. Jane on Fillmore is the perfect coffee shop SPQR is just down the street and there's tons of other cute stores on Fillmore. Accessing the apartment was a breeze and I'd definitely stay here again!
36928741,538461034,2019-09-29,62862742,Kristin,We enjoyed the unit as it met the needs we had for our short stay in San Francisco. The only complaint was that the room was drafty and cold at night and in the early morning. The draft came from the windows which is the location of the head of each of the two beds. We had to layer up on clothes to be warm enough while sleeping. Currently the season is early Fall.
18567743,270923543,2018-05-30,73073777,Geraldine,Wonderful informative welcoming hosts! Will definitely book again for another out of town guest!
2677273,326168557,2018-09-21,27068157,Janelle,Roy and Patti's place is a home away from home! All our questions were answered very quickly via the app - very friendly hosts! My parents actually stayed at the place (I live in SF) and the neighbourhood is my old stomping ground - it's safe and not crazy busy which they liked. The place was extremely clean tidy and well-maintained. All the standard amenities were readily available and our hosts kindly went the extra mile to provide some simple things to get us started (like cereal and milk etc.). I would definitely recommend this place and hope to use it again when more family is in town. For anyone who doesn't know the area - this place is a great location for getting to the Presidio Golden Gate park and grabbing cross-town buses via California Street or Geary Street which gets you downtown or over to the Embarcadero.
16426353,257321370,2018-04-25,165438760,Julio,This place was overall very nice and it was very thoughtful to have coffee and tea in the lobby <3
2178509,415842490,2019-02-23,3274630,Meg,Great place! Super friendly and accommodating host -- felt right at home!
12857222,254702851,2018-04-17,13927633,Hai-Dang,Overlooked this property the last time I was in town. The location is absolutely amazing for the value.
1077444,484865307,2019-07-09,23143710,思维,非常自主的生活方式又非常便利的服务体验很感谢andrea的照顾这个街区很美好值得多住多逛逛美丽的公园景观和海边日落会让我记得很久很久｡
130805,1340066,2012-05-24,1016652,Brian,Sue and Mike were great hosts and their apartment is perfectly located for exploring the Mission and surrounding neighborhoods. They had great advice about restaurants and how to get around the city and the availability of coffee and a light breakfast in the apartment's spacious kitchen was a great touch! 
8276309,106715458,2016-10-07,43591023,Adam,Great place Sara and Nathan were very accommodating.  Great location and very comfortable.  
29802575,368722242,2019-01-07,11293285,Tiffany,"HIGHLY recommend staying at this place if you want cleanliness convenience affordability and an amazing Airbnb experience! My boyfriend and I decided to visit the city for a ""stay-cation"" weekend and found this was the perfect place for 2 although there was definitely enough space for 3 or 4 as there is a cozy couch in the living room. Our hosts Katherine and Daniel were super friendly quick to respond to my request and  attentive throughout our stay. Their instructions for finding and entering their home was seamless. The space itself was wonderfully charming clean and surprisingly spacious for a place in SF. There was also a cute outdoor backyard which would be great for summer night hang outs. They provided all the amenities you needed for your stay and I must say the bed was EXTRA comfy! Not only does their place feel homey and warm the location is incredibly CONVENIENT! Their place is walking distance (5-10 min walk) from public transportation (BART MUNI) and right next door is a Wholefoods! So awesome for a quick food or drink run!! The neighborhood itself is very close to bars restaurants and just a MUNI/BART ride away to Union Square The Ferry Building Fisherman's Wharf  or any of the touristy spots to hit. Additionally the neighborhood felt safe to walk around which is very important to me. I cannot stress how great of an experience we had and I look forward to staying at this location for my future visits to the city!"
5572169,245829760,2018-03-23,113064354,Grace,This was the perfect quiet oasis in the city while also still walkable to restaurants/shops! Exactly as pictures appear. Clean and an all around relaxing hideaway.  Nespresso machine for use in the morning’s was awesome!
12562572,237940582,2018-02-24,145409143,Jacklyn,This is a fantastic place to stay while experiencing San Francisco! It is conveniently located and it has everything you need! Brad has added many thoughtful touches to his place and it makes it feel more at home! We loved the variety of breakfast options because we were constantly on the go sight seeing so it was helpful to be able to grab something quick! We would recommend staying here to anyone and we hope to be back as well!
5013816,70714816,2016-04-20,31803123,Chris,"You will not be disappointed booking Jeff's San Fran listing!

Location wise this place is right in the middle of where you want to be as a tourist all the main attractions are close by and easily accessible. There was also lots of cute bars and restaurants walking distance away and the supermarket opposite was handy too!

The room itself was spacious with a separate walk in closet and beautiful large ensuite. The interior of the whole space was great and was easily comparable to a 5* hotel.

Jeff was a great host letting us store our bags early and had lots of tips and knowledge to share to get the most out of our time in San Fran.

Overall we would not hesitate to rebook this room and would highly recommend it!!"
918341,196627021,2017-09-23,138736983,Shaun,Great location and a really friendly accommodating host. Would highly recommend
24670819,270305444,2018-05-28,191011085,Stephanie,We really enjoyed our stay at Young’s super cute place it’s a great location and has all the amenities you need! 
12780009,405854818,2019-01-27,68610933,Saemi,위치 좋고 청결하고 인테리어도 감각적이고 매우 좋았어요.  1층 펍도 추천입니다.
6430646,161306626,2017-06-17,115698499,Rachel,David it the absolute best he was very welcoming and answered any questions we had. His place is in a great area and easily accessible to other parts of the city. 
749990,29413111,2015-04-07,25825872,Brian,This is a beautifully maintained apartment that is very thoughtfully managed. The rooms are large and light everything is new the bathroom and shower are great. Arthur the host was prompt clear and complete with his information. We paid for the off street parking and in this part of San Francisco it is a great idea. If you're there on the weekend the bar on the corner (The Page) creates a good bit of noise until 2am which is the only real drawback. If you're a light sleeper that's a problem. Maybe someday there will be double-paned windows then this would be the perfect space! Be prepared to climb stairs -- no big deal for me but it might matter to others. The pullout sofa is a model we have at home and is the most comfortable you can buy. If Arthur's place is available on our next trip to visit our daughter who lives nearby (and he'll have us!) we would love to return.
19570849,468103264,2019-06-11,214042430,Christian,Nice place.  Great local tips and a great place to be in San Fran.  Safe place to park a car close to your location as well. There are lots of rules cameras on the door to the air bnb and WiFi connected devices through the house.
13263750,248128556,2018-03-30,20883550,Arvid,Good value for the price close to polk street with great bars and resturants etc
25634749,312572245,2018-08-23,194528381,Anne,Nice and quiet place to stay but it is an hour from the city center if you take the train. 
6344500,517854026,2019-08-25,117149413,Terry,A few words about our stay at Gautam’s place. Cheers to the amazing location spotless home killer service. I can’t think of anything else to say other than it was awesome.
1277771,17035086,2014-08-06,10150385,Jacques,Many thanks to Jon & Christine. The appartment is very nice and well located to visit San Francisco. Jon & Christine were very helpful and gave us some good advices. As soon as we sent a question by email we received the answer immediatly. We appreciated that.
13606695,106892353,2016-10-08,91894052,Tina,Max's place was great! His place is just as pictured and explained. Very clean. We are very happy with our experience and would stay here again!!
4617719,224643903,2018-01-03,163022478,Francis,Garland was an excellent host. He his place was clean he had great snacks for a family Netflix board games and very comfortable beds. He even baked us cookies and a loaf of bread. He was very informative with San Francisco when he gave us the tour of his house. I would definitely stay at his place next time I go to San Francisco.
749990,7992702,2013-10-11,853837,Randall,Nice digs; beautifully remodeled spotless and well-cared for. Amy Jeff and their crew put a lot into keeping the flat pristine and fresh between visitors. Located in a really great central San Francisco section with beautiful nature and urban refinements all around. Amy was easy to reach and helped make our visit smooth.
431632,2723472,2012-10-26,3761110,Cheri,Very clean and quiet little place real comfortable bed! Was also VERY easy to find off Golden Gate Bridge in rush hour! Great location as it was near lots of restaurants within walking distance and the bus stops. Hosts were very informative and friendly with great advice for sight seeing. Parking is a bit tough for those not used to city parking. The complimentary bottle of wine and original artwork by Brian puts a great touch on this place. 
21928413,444259866,2019-04-27,248704873,Liuliu,good location super clean great host highly recommended
1392204,19498941,2014-09-13,2750190,Evanne,Dee was a wonderful warm and friendly host.  Her home is resplendent with beautiful views of San Francisco and her neighborhood up on a hill feels safe and is lovely to walk in.  My daughter and I just stayed one night at Dee's place but felt we had made a friend by the time we left in the morning.  She gave us a great tip for dinner - an Indian food restaurant within walking distance that was excellent and affordable.  We both had a comfortable sleep and delicious coffee/white pomegranate tea in the morning before we headed down the coast.  Thank you Dee for your hospitality.
1629740,103858682,2016-09-24,85887044,Patricia,Our stay at Dana's place at the Donatello was perfect! It was a beautiful clean hotel.Close to transportation and very easy to get anywhere. I would recommend a stay with Dana! 
1229606,30709978,2015-04-26,6242147,Danny,John's place was great! My new employee really enjoyed staying there. Definitely recommend for folks looking to stay near the city.
15567704,278238783,2018-06-17,57489559,Zel,The location of Vannida's apartment is superb. It is about 10 feet away from one Muni (public transportation) stop and 15 feet away from another Muni stop both of which take a person into Downtown San Francisco for $2.75 in about 5 minutes. The space was functional and we had no issues. We didn't have a problem with the homeless because we simply entered and exited the property. There are always people around and the location next to Safeway as also very practical. I would definitely stay here again if I have a conference in downtown San Francisco and didn't foresee spending much time at the property. It's perfectly fine for someone who comes for business.
7331464,141575823,2017-04-03,10537368,Sarah,This property is immaculate well laid-out and extremely comfortable. Everything is brand new. Susan is a lovely and hospitable host. Highly recommend. 
28734043,408555836,2019-02-04,104488226,Sukhan,Everything is perfect! I’ve never seen this super clean and luxurious house when I have traveled. Hosts are really kind and thoughtful. And the house is so calm. You better stay in this house for sure. Best choice I’ve ever had.
6331695,59779045,2016-01-15,43359994,Miguel,Great place in a very convenient location! Everything you need for a short stay in SFO
905399,454211467,2019-05-17,11703927,Cole,Nancy was a great host very quick to respond and help me get checked in. The location of her place is great: right near the 24th st BART station which is super convenient for the airport or downtown.
7548762,103717461,2016-09-24,83132134,Paul,The location is very close to Union Square and other interesting places. Also close to public transportation.  Room was just renovated and good you only have to ask for clean towels or cleaning the room they will not do that themselves.  
4833101,436710595,2019-04-13,192249826,Marcelo,Realmente es 100% recomendable una gran persona un gran anfitrión  !!!! sin duda cuando vuelva a San Francisco me hospedare en su hogar.
2538807,15677584,2014-07-14,1639675,Meredith,This apartment was a decent place to stay in SF. It's location was good. The apartment is very close to the subway & a good selection of restaurants. We had a car & were able to get around to the major sites easily. The apartment was clean & the bed was comfortable. My only concern was I didn't realize the suite is one of two on the ground floor of the home. The walls were on the thin side & we were able to hear muffled conversations & the showers being ran etc. This unfortunately caused us to be woken up earlier in the morning than we would have liked. Otherwise we had an enjoyable stay here & found the host very friendly and accessible. 
24654041,548462900,2019-10-17,48285726,Holger,Gute Unterkunft nah zur Strassenbahn und vielen guten restaurants und Cafes. unkomplizierter Check-In und superschnelle kommunikation. Empfehlenswert.
130805,244080628,2018-03-18,178376843,Vanessa,"Great experience in visiting the organic farm. 
Perfect arrangement delicious organic food professional introduction to organic farming and nice people."
25547908,283387542,2018-06-29,33227121,Sonja,The location was awesome. It was close to the park and the beach. Parking was easy. I stayed with my 11 year old for the entire week and it worked out great. The accommodations are minimal a bed and a nightstand. The bed was comfy and clean. The bathroom is shared with other guests so that might not work for everyone. I think this is an ideal place for anyone coming to town for a class or workshop. This is not a place to sit around and relax. There is no TV or chairs to kick back in. It is a safe clean place to sleep and shower. I would definitely stay here again.
519796,234426270,2018-02-12,17791153,Mimi,Suzette was a very accommodating and responsible host.  She left us lovely breakfast foods and was a great communicator for check-in.  The location was ideal for visiting our family being on lively Polk St close to  Fort Mason and walks along the water.  We could get any where easily with Lyft or public transportation.
20155597,348406390,2018-11-13,124376254,Ikue,子どもを含めた家族で滞在しましたが､部屋は広く快適に過ごすことができました｡場所も便利です｡建物自体は新しくないものの､清潔に保たれていました｡設備やｱﾒﾆﾃｨ､周辺の案内など､全体的に気配りが素晴らしかったです｡
1125079,8992937,2013-12-01,8177088,Roberto,"I booked a couple of rooms for my uncle and parents (this is one of them) during my stay at the house so everything was perfect too for them.

As I said in my other review this is the place to be in San Francisco."
29634396,345322812,2018-11-04,152541617,Arturo,The place was amazing and beautiful! Very comfortable and safe area! I would love to come back and stay again!:)

12115392,227391246,2018-01-14,58390824,Ella,Room is clean and bed is very comfortable. We didn't see Ethan much but he made sure we got in when we wanted and were comfortable in the space. Location is amazing - really so close to Dolores park. Would definitely stay again!
4106442,290586976,2018-07-14,18952050,Jason,Samantha was a great great host! This place was the perfect hub for our adventures. We loved that this place was so close to so many cool coffee shops restaurants bars and shopping. We also loved the vibe and feel of the Mission neighborhood. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay here on our next trip to San Fran!
12041223,525341344,2019-09-07,37593953,Marie,The room is fine for a stop in San Francisco. Privacy in the cozy house with our en suite bathroom. Everything was very clean. Be able to let the car park on the street and transport the suite easy to all san Francisco. It was so good
259621,321105102,2018-09-09,45410757,Philip,Great location downtown.
585225,4137372,2013-04-13,2435848,Lucie,"Gabe was kind & considerate with impeccable taste and great local knowledge. We thoroughly enjoyed all his recommendations.
The space is stylish & comfortable with breathtaking views in a fantastic location. Only a 10 minute walk to The Mission district and Dolores Park. Will definitely be back!"
10990428,348408411,2018-11-13,3216167,Beth,Jia was helpful with suggestions for restaurants.
14983353,131593322,2017-02-12,2761429,Bridgette,Great location and stay! Clean and bright :)
1241029,179544024,2017-08-07,895109,Jeffrey,Great stay.  Thank goodness the owner removed the lock from the bedroom door which ensures that you won't lock your keys in the bedroom (which I have done before)! There was only one other guest in the place during my stay and she was very nice.   The owner's mom is very very nice.  I picked up the keys at her place--only a mile walk from this place.  The owner also gave me a fan to use at night which really helps beat the heat!  great stay.
1855096,19361963,2014-09-11,15426258,Brianna,Amazing flat and extremely generous host. It's the best Airbnb I've stayed in thus far. Highly recommend. 
2509236,151400650,2017-05-12,3331496,Lindsay,Wonderful neighborhood close to restaurants and stores. Sally was very accommodating and helpful. The garden was relaxing and the space was very quiet. The bed was a very comfortable twin.
18904,524831430,2019-09-06,600205,Ukko-Pekka,This was one of the greatest AirBnb experiences we’ve ever had! The location is perfect specially if you like a hipster-ish kind of feeling but it is still a very quiet and peaceful location. Patrick knows the city super well and is the perfect host. We really loved staying there. Thank you!
8274904,226254499,2018-01-09,41636313,Jennifer,Saundra is an exceptional host with a beautiful home.  She was incredibly accommodating and the home is in a very vibrant neighborhood.  I would definitely stay here again.
5905163,39276038,2015-07-22,32505522,Paul,Diana and Michael were superfriendly and REALLY easy to get along with. They really open up their home to you and you feel very welcome. Their location was also a big plus we found easy to get to and from by either car or local commute. Highly recommended !

2178509,52488465,2015-10-30,8727750,Marianne,The pictures looked very promising and we were not disappointed. The appartement is beautiful every detail fits. And above that Gregg is a great host who can give you advice on about everything you need to know starting from great restaurants to helpful hints for car drivers.

2274353,167756725,2017-07-07,106405123,Hayden,We needed a space for some last minute visitors from our foreign headquarters and Chris' place fit the bill. Chris made everything easy. 
4902855,556534556,2019-10-29,50512253,Jennifer,This is a very conveniently located space just a quick 15 minute walk to union square japantown and chinatown! The space itself is exactly as pictured very clean and had a very easy check in and check out process. Definitely would recommend Tony’s place to anyone looking for both a convenient and affordable stay!
15843930,279483848,2018-06-20,27754193,Bruce,We loved the size of the house.  We were 4 women. 4 more people could have stayed there comfortably.  Ian supplied everything  we needed in terms of basic supplies and linens.  The kitchen is fully equipped with modern appliances. The sky light in the Living Room area was a nice surprise and the house is very bright and has an open feeling. There is a TV in the Living room area as well as a large TV on the wall of  the lower floor master bedroom which has a king size bed. There is a Washer/ Dryer ironing board iron etc in the lower floor area.  The master bathroom is great with 2 separate sinks.  Recently renovated area.
23632116,444283089,2019-04-27,22346606,Janet,Connie is quick when responding any question I had.
16497229,176360458,2017-07-30,12435757,Peter & Catherine,"The Calming Blue Room was a great home base for our adventures in San Francisco. We rented bikes and took full advantage of being close to the Wharf downtown and Golden Gate Bridge. The room itself was comfortable and peaceful. We slept well every night and had no issues with bathroom access even though it was shared. There is a low hum that happens in the morning apparently from the diner two floors down but it didn't bother us.

Speaking of Pat's Diner (downstairs and two doors over) they provided a great breakfast for us more than once. 

If you're coming in from out-of-town and you've got luggage we'd recommend Uber or a taxi. The house is a 30 minute walk from the nearest BART station.

We loved the art and the overall ambience of Elisa's house and would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy central location for exploring the best of San Francisco."
348714,3808884,2013-03-17,677812,Felix,Although we did not get to meet George he has been very responsive and helpful thoughout our stay. The place is very neat and tidy. Transport to downtown via bus makes it very convenient. I highly recommend George's place to other fellow travellers.
1392204,292763458,2018-07-18,17524758,Trisha,"Dee's home puts you at ease in this busy city.  We felt like we were at home in her home. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and the bedding was soft clean and luxurious. Light breakfast and fruit was offered in the morning.
Dee's advice and guidance regarding what to see where to go and where not to go was invaluable. She's a great storyteller.  Funny and kind.  Dee really is a super host."
878935,147034232,2017-04-24,98882173,Laurence,Appartement parfait à tout point de vue pour un séjour à San Francisco. Merci encore à Ashley et à son mari pour leur accueil chaleureux et leurs gentilles attentions.

13848713,545114723,2019-10-11,276565153,Timothy,I have stayed here twice and have had a great experience both times. The apartment is very clean and spacious. The neighborhood is very cute with tons of good restaurants. You can get reasonably-priced weekly gym memberships just up the street. The owners have been upfront about having a small child that can sometimes make some noise but I never found it to be a problem.
29594605,523523105,2019-09-03,135632012,Crystal,This was an ideal spot to stay!  Amazing views and fantastic cafes / dining all within walking distance yet had a cozy residential feel. Very clean and comfortable space.

394575,161300275,2017-06-17,115903088,Manisha,"Mike and Nic are good hosts. Though they were traveling during our stay period but they stayed in touch and answered all our questions on time. Also they had given us their friend Christopher's number to help us with anything. We stayed in their airbnb for six days. This house's location is great. There are plenty of eating places nearby. It has an excellent bus connectivity. All of it is in 5-10mins walking distance. 

House is good for three people. It is very well organized. Everything is clean and systematic. I have dust allergies and it worries me a lot whenever I travel. But in their house I didn't have any bout of allergies and i could sleep well.

Their bathroom is very tiny so not good for a large size people."

Seul point négatif le bruit assez fort du restaurant juste en dessous (ventilation forte jusqu’à fermeture). Cependant Paul a été très réactif pour notre arrivée tout est bien organisé et son petit chien très mignon
30069424,529325332,2019-09-14,85477074,John,"Edwin was a great host and it has been a pleasant stay at his place in San Francisco. 

YAY :)
1) Responsive host
2) Good location
3) Well equipped
4) Accommodating host

NAY :(
1) Cleanliness issue in the common areas and bedrooms can be improved. Could be better if the fixture are refreshed as they are rather worn out.

Overall it was a 4 star ratings for his hospitality!

Thank you Edwin for hosting us!"

After the first day of a longish bus ride to downtown I re-read Emilie's wonderful package of information and realized we should have taken the ""N"" train as it did indeed ""whisk"" us there in 10 minutes!  Having 2 bathrooms was wonderful with 3 teenagers. Our only regret is that we had to come home . We would definitely recommend Emilie's place!"
238204,196324843,2017-09-22,15762727,Doug,The place was exactly as advertised.  The communication with Jennifer was outstanding and the place is in a cool neighborhood.
3611131,51155976,2015-10-18,43728552,Shana,The apartment's central location in the city was very safe and convenient and we had very little trouble finding parking for our rental car. The apartment was a perfect alternative to a hotel room for our 4-night stay in San Francisco. 
567239,304541718,2018-08-09,32965943,Leticia,"Judy and Ed were great hosts! They gave us plenty of useful tips and they lend us a lonely planet guide.
Breakfast was quite good and we were able to enjoy the terrace which was a plus!
We had a great time we even share dinner with them!
The neighborhood is really nice get ready for exercising your legs since streets go up and down!

21187925,227883787,2018-01-16,10979239,Diego,Excelente por dónde se lo mire. Ubicación en un barrio muy lindo de casas y cómoda para salir para todos lados con una vista espectacular de San Francisco. El estudio muy acogedor cómodo y con todas las facilidades para cocinar con una barra muy linda. La cama muy cómoda. Que tenga cochera es una ventaja muy grande. Jorge y Anna atentos en todo momento y a nuestra disposición para nuestras consultas. Y con detalles de atención muy buenos. Sin dudar volveríamos a este estudio.
29407754,526333711,2019-09-08,17011854,Laura,Great location very comfortable and clean apartment. Would definitely stay there again.

During the duration of the long weekend our privacy was respected and it was quiet. 
Overall the experience was very good and made a fantastic first impression of using AirBNB. "
3116974,52240263,2015-10-27,2720764,Anna,Carrie and her apartment were so welcoming it was as if we had come to stay with friends ... A home from home!  The apartment is perfectly located and just a short walk away from some great restaurants.  I'd highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay again when I next visit San Francisco!
2578122,180974457,2017-08-11,17835785,Kevin,Brian was very attentive and was well versed with the area. He was able to make excellent recommendations for nearby places to go for dinner/drinks. His property was clean and offered plenty of room for your comfort. The space is setup as a social environment so you should expect to share a communal bathroom kitchen and living room area. Brian on top of the overall location of his property is the winning factor here. Thanks B!
14475808,167140546,2017-07-05,68258018,Hannah,Very clean. Bed was rather hard. Overall I would recommend.

224579,420763245,2019-03-07,22501367,Kae,Armelle's place totally exceeded my expectations! It's a beautiful space very spacious clean and comfortable. The location is great too — I'd much rather stay in a neighborhood like Potrero than a busy or touristy area. Armelle was a speedy communicator when it came to check in/check out and any questions I had about her place. I'd definitely stay here again.
1005642,13148151,2014-05-20,13835365,Alice,My stay at Jan's house was great. The location was very convenient close to lots of cool bars and beautiful restaurants. Transport was easy with a bus stop close by that took about 30 mins to get into places like Fisherman's Wharf. There is Mission Park just around the corner that offers a pretty great view of the city and seems to be a great chill out area for all kinds. I really enjoyed my stay! Also the cat Thriller was very friendly I enjoyed giving him pats! 
13686323,325460054,2018-09-19,74146199,Tiffany,Very pretty! Loved the decor and location made it easy to Uber and walk to places. Great space in the room again loved the decor. Some great local restaurants nearby and the staff is incredible.

277339,207245542,2017-10-28,1195322,Kamilah,The garden alone is worth the price of admission. It is seriously magical. Our hosts went above and beyond to accommodate us and have great insights on where to eat drink wine etc.  The apt. was totally charming beds were super comfy and the bathroom was spacious. Location was excellent; very easy to walk certain places and close to major modes of transportation. Can't think of one reason not to stay again and again.

We were both very glad that we chose to stay and have breakfast with Peter in the morning.  He made us fresh fruit coffee and french toast (VERY GOOD FRENCH TOAST).  Thank you so much Peter....we hope to be back again."
6911587,226281280,2018-01-09,1486512,Amanda,This was really a home away from home ❤️ The whole family was really friendly and I even got to read a book with their daughter! Loved that the bed has an electric blanket and how close it is to all the restaurants and cool spots in the mission. Good spot if you’re looking for a cozy down-to-earth stay :)
35686836,475791105,2019-06-24,10514397,Sharon,This accommodation was great wonderful spaces and very private. The location was well placed and accessible to the Stonestown Mall with many food options. Very clean and comfortable with good beds. All amenities were provided as described and hosts were responsive. Would be very happy to return on another occasion.
12657863,456475738,2019-05-21,245909432,Francheska Eloisa,The place is awesome. It’s pretty close to the places we needed to go to so it’s no issue. Check in is absolutely easy. The place is very clean. I did how there was a TV tho because it got a bit boring without any. And in the middle of the night it got a bit hot and you have no control of the temperature since there was no thermostat in the room. So maybe a small fan would help. There was no bath mat as well. But all in all the pace was awesome. Daniel was absolutely great. Highly recommend it.
8167459,120929801,2016-12-12,30697237,Sumera,We had a wonderful stay at Michelle's place. The place is very comfortable and cute. It has a great view is Ocean Beach. Michelle's place is about a 20 minute drive to downtown and within a 10 minute walk there are some restaurants. There is plenty of parking around this place. Michelle left us plenty of snacks and breakfast food items and lots of towels. We would definitely recommend this place. Thank you Michelle!
16134193,329386373,2018-09-28,38753350,Lauren,We had a great time at Martin’s place. Check in way easy. He was easy to get ahold of for any questions. The place was well located and really comfortable. Perfect for our needs. Would highly recommend!
2177440,528240525,2019-09-12,121546635,Suvi,"The best Airbnb experience ever! We stayed 7 nights at Ron's place and it was just perfect spot for us to explore the beautiful city of San Francisco. 

Neighbourhood is clean safe and it has a great city view. We used MUNI every day - bus 33 and metro (Castro) are both very close to Ron's home. 

The room was really decent size bed was super comfortable and own toilet and bath was clean and spacious. We enjoyed the breakfast Ron offered to us. It was great to start a new day with coffee cereals and yoghurt. :) 

Ron as a host is just excellent. He gave us a lot of good advices for what to do or see while we are on San Francisco. He also suggested us to go check out Stanford university in Palo Alto and gave us advices how to get in there. That suggestion did't let us down! :)

Thank you so much Ron to let us stay at your home!"
1393654,427472734,2019-03-23,54789273,Mac,The experience was a lot different to any other Airbnb I’ve stayed in sharing the space with Kevin and his family but it was a nice stay.

Just be aware that there are a lot of steps to the apartment  and arriving late at night after a long air flight it is a bit daunting. 
Once installed the place is a great place to be."
2771128,30516445,2015-04-23,15050720,Amy,Beautiful and quiet! This studio was absolutely wonderful. Clean quiet beautiful and with an amazing view. I was in town on business and would choose Stephanie's place over a hotel any day. Short walk to a number of GREAT shops & restaurants very safe neighborhood and Stephanie provides a list of recommendations. The bathroom was amazing beautiful finishes and the bed was incredibly comfortable. I cannot say enough good things about this place and hope to return the next time I'm in SF!
21581753,231137305,2018-01-30,167397882,Shirley,The place is nice; interior was stylish and accurate. He is very quick at communication. The apartment is within walkable distance to shopping areas and easily accessible to the bus. Would recommend! 
9063798,281897222,2018-06-25,148579290,Matt,Our stay at Carl's couldn't have been better. From check-in to check-out we felt so very welcome. He offered fantastic recommendations for local spots and the AirBnb amenities were outstanding - common space to meet other guests hot tub washer/dryer. I will absolutely be looking into this AirBnb for my next San Francisco visit. I'd take this over a hotel any day. 
2614717,491106690,2019-07-19,200806249,Lükas,"We had a wonderful long-term stay! Sonia and Jasons house has the perfect position in SF if you want to calm down after a long day. They live well-connected to the MUNI. They are protected by two lovely small dogs you only can fall in love with.
Jason and Sonia are very nice you can ask them every question you have. They answer very fast we've got answers within minutes!
Hope you will have the same nice stay we had."
28548553,412097909,2019-02-14,2245800,Clay,"An absolutely perfect stay. Our hosts could not have been better. They were extremely responsive to any requests and questions leading up to our stay. During our stay they checked in a few times to ensure we had everything we needed. 

The space was exactly as described. Very clean and spacious especially for a SF home. The neighborhood was quiet and less than a 20 minute drive from the airport and Union Square. The rooftop was spacious and inviting with great views of the city. We especially enjoyed the extra touch of breakfast options in the morning (bagels OJ coffee cereal). It’s the little things that go a long way and this house had plenty of them. 

I would recommended this house to anyone. Thanks for the great stay!"
14934208,433123105,2019-04-05,28816343,Robbie,Amazing place in a great location. Check in is super easy and Collin is very responsive.

34684071,518558207,2019-08-26,216511176,Jasmine,Sam & Binbin are very kind hospitable hosts! Their suite was sparkling clean filled with amenities (coffee bars toiletries) and in a quiet and safe neighborhood. We wanted to stay by Ocean Beach and the Sunset District so this was the perfect most budget-friendly option. Sam and Binbin are located right above the suite so if we needed anything they were quick to respond and even assist us personally. They even reached out to us to make sure we had everything we needed for our stay. We felt so welcomed and prioritized by them. There’s no entertainment units (TV’s) but it didn’t bother us since we were out in the city most of the time. They do have a fridge (helpful with our leftovers) plates utensils a microwave coffee tea water and yummy fig bars. We wouldn’t mind staying here again!

1520938,71740528,2016-04-28,38185670,Ameet,We are a family of four with two small kids and had a very comfortable stay at Jonathan's place. We never got to meet him in person but he was very helpful in securing a temporary parking permit and providing recommendations of things to do in the city. The apartment gets very good sunlight as advertised. It's located on the street level and fortunately that was not an issue as there was very little foot traffic outside. We took advantage of the kitchen and appreciated the basics were provided (olive oil salt pepper etc).
1121697,57877181,2015-12-30,18010576,Andre,Our whole family (6 of us) stayed for 6 days. We thoroughly enjoyed Giancarlo’s home. It was very spacious and had most of our meals there; we made good use of the kitchen! Everything was clean and worked as expected. The location neighbourhood size and views are great. It's walking distance to several groceries stores and all other amenities. Its also very close to Alamo Square Park.  Overall it made our Xmas holidays are memorable occasion.

The room was attractive and clean and the location is in a pleasant neighborhood near a bus route into the city. I really enjoyed my time at Sally's house and would highly recommend staying there.

17433075,530442931,2019-09-15,126621554,Kristin,I would definitely recommend this as a cute funky place to stay in the city and a great location. I had first reserved a shared room and the experience started off great (the bedding on the bunk bed was really nice and cozy a personal reading lamp and outlets conveniently located so I could charge my phone) all things I really appreciate. Other travelers where nice and friendly. Unfortunately at a late hour one of the guest came in and proceeded to snore grunt and moan in their sleep at a volume that seemed inhuman. Needless to say i had a terrible nights sleep. I realize this is beyond the host control and I suppose that’s always the risk with a shared room. I reached out to Zarinah and she was so compassionate and understanding. She helped me change my reservation to a private suit and I couldn’t have been happier. The Rose Garden room was adorable with cozy feminine decor big bay windows with a great view of  the neighborhood and a plush soft bed. Having an attentive host is so important and you will definitely have that staying here. And save yourself the trouble and book a private room if you can. Also on the weekend there is a lot of easy street parking and free for much of the time.  I thought I’d have to put my car in a garage and I actually didn’t need to the whole time I was there.
5749181,231763130,2018-02-02,19618832,Katharine,Nora's apartment is a cozy clean one-person space perfect for a business traveler or solo visitor wanting to explore the city. The apartment is cheery and comfortable. The neighborhood Noe Valley has a lot of charm. Highly recommend and hope to stay again!
13293285,111306283,2016-10-30,75633199,Kristen,"Nice safe location close to Safeway and a whole street of Asian food. The bed was VERY NICE. Honestly one of the best sleeps because of the bed. There were clean towels beer Milano cookies waiting for us when we arrived. The place was clean and comfortable. Ira and Vlad also were very helpful with the check in even though we did not meet them personally. 

Things to note: pictures make the suite look bigger than it is but if you're just needing a budget place to stay in SF this is for you. Lots of street parking but just make sure to read the signs to be safe. "
964751,60492764,2016-01-24,52558845,Artur,This was my first experience with Airbnb and I couldn't be happier with it. The place was beautiful clean comfortable and had every facility me and my friends needed to feel like home. The studio's location was excellent quiet and easily accessible to public transport and food places. Phil was a great and helpful host having made even a guidebook with lots of tips and ideas of what to do in San Francisco. If I have the chance I will be back for sure.

It surpassed our expectations and we didnt have a single complaint for our stay. I will stay here again if I am ever in the area again. Thanks again Issac for a wonderful experience.
27674344,349526801,2018-11-17,122081722,Larry,Just the right size for a couple. The clean comfortable two room apartment is in a quiet neighborhood outside the hustle and bustle of down town. It is conveniently located near a public transit stop grocery store and a great ice cream shop. Anila is a welcoming hostess. She checked in with us frequently as we entered town to make sure all was going well and to get our stay off to a good start.
21425660,236636176,2018-02-19,24356038,Licca,A lovely place located in a quiet and distant area. I took Uber or Lyft at most of the time so it's fine for us. There is no kettle and hairdryer provided which is inconvenient for girls. The coffee maker is not clean enough to boil clear water yet Clint did offered to prepare some hot water for us. No convenience store nearby.

1206184,95960573,2016-08-21,64532966,Mary,The listing is as described- this is a great little part of San Francisco. It was very easy for my husband and I to bus around town to sites. Enjoyed being close to Golden Gate Park. Lots of great food and drink places within a short walk. Ashir and his wife Margaret were great hosts. Very friendly and great to stay with! 
9110032,128817038,2017-01-27,39491850,Kim,"Brian is nice and he basically has everything I need here. The house is about 35 mins away from downtown by bus but it's only like 1 min walk from the nearest bus stop. Besides the neighborhood is quiet and safe. There are restaurants and grocery stores nearby and also a movie theater few blocks away which is quite convenient.
My friend and I spent almost a month in SF and we did enjoy our stay in Brian's house! It's an unbeatable place to stay especially if you're on a budget."
284117,552018978,2019-10-20,5678424,Grace,Samantha’s place was perfect for my stay! Cute quiet and in a perfect location. Extremely spacious - couldn’t have asked for more!
499096,360444372,2018-12-20,1180614,Carol,Ingrid is a great host!  Small but very comfortable place in the best location.  Soothing space where you can get a great nights sleep.  I highly recommend Ingrid’s place!
22015376,278285061,2018-06-17,4365733,Jeff,"This is a great opportunity so seize it if you can. I think the location is pretty self-explanatory but if not let's say you can walk to any kind of food you could conceivably want at any hour any entertainment music activity etc. Any event in the city is going to be easy to get to. You can walk to the MUNI subway in 2 minutes and ride 4 stops to Union Square or anywhere else. It's stupid fun.

And then the place itself is the smartest home I've ever seen. Gadges for days and stylish and comfortable to boot."
29874095,415107329,2019-02-21,45167415,George,Keisha’s place is great! Great view!
562311,452670021,2019-05-13,97565998,Lauren,Her space was great and she made her home feel like a hotel.
4902907,561182769,2019-11-08,246487075,Nayoon,"호스트가 굉장히 친절하시고 응답속도가 빨랐다
예정과 다르게 조금 일찍 도착했는데 방이 이미 준비가 되어있어서 일찍 체크인 할 수 있어 다행이었다. 공용 화장실은 내가 사용하려 할때마다 단 한번도 누군가가 쓰고 있던 적이 없었다. 위치는 너무 좋은 숙소였지만 근처에 홈리스들이 너무너무 많아서 조금 무서웠다. 남편과 온게 아니라 여자친구와 온거였다면 진짜 너무 무서웠을 것 같기도 하다."
1487849,325786971,2018-09-20,25575496,Aleksandar,Great place I can easily recommend. Nice neighborhood very nice apartment very clean with a 5 star bathroom. Maury was very polite and prompt with answering our texts. Everything was exactly as advertised on Airbnb.
9532943,138435279,2017-03-19,120370685,Keegan,Had an amazing time! Would definitely recommend staying here. It is in a great central convenient location.  
14422371,192107220,2017-09-09,26898415,Amy,"Great:
Good place very comfortable bed and clean room can use the kitchen. That is a plus for us to stay there. Very clear instruction for check-in and check-out which is really convenient. 
Not that great:
They split the second floor into several rooms each room can occupy 4-6 people. Hence it is busy during morning time to use the bathroom."
17795712,436725198,2019-04-13,217600802,Pamela,La experiencia fue maravillosa el lugar las personas todo en general
5253439,469000751,2019-06-13,258849763,Brenda,The place is VERY homey. It's not your traditional hostel the hosts actually talk to you and seem genuinely interested in making your stay a good one. The area is a good one I'm a short female and I felt pretty safe going out at night. (no later than 11 pm tho) Just don't look like a tourist. I definitely recommend staying at Z&D's you also get to meet so many different people. My second night a group of us who had met that same morning went out for breakfast and ended up going to the Golden Gate Park and hiking by the Presidio. As long as you keep an open mind you'll definitely have a good time.
2592518,342905952,2018-10-29,61440817,Carrie,Daniel's place is so awesome! We enjoyed our nights there the inside is even cooler than the pictures I would definitely stay here again.
277339,347725106,2018-11-11,87717580,Jack,"The place is amazing the cute little details around the house make it homely the garden is an amazing place to relax. Natalie and Paige were amazing hosts that were attentive accomodating and just genuinely nice people. They helped us out with all our needs giving suggestion for places to go informing us on local activities and little touches like having scones and fresh milk when we arrived. Also letting us drop our bags off early so we didn’t have to lug them around till check in. Also they baked us muffins on or departure. You won’t find better host
The house is located in a great place near shops cafes and lots of options for public transport. All in short walking distance. I suggest using Muni for transport like Natalie and Paige recommended as the routes have amazing scenery. I can’t wait to stay here again as it was the highlight of our US trip"
654279,30492227,2015-04-23,22105817,Brad,We had a great time staying with Chris and Tim. It was our first experience using Airbnb and will fefinately use it again. They were both very friendly and helpful and gave us excellent suggestions on wineries to visit in Napa. Thanks for making our stay in San Fran so enjoyable.
4365969,131908029,2017-02-14,63311771,Brittany,We had an amazing time at Leslie's place! It is very close to public transit so it was easy to get to from the airport as well as get to the rest of the city to explore. Both Leslie and Richard kept us in the loop of how to get into the house as well as things to do in the area. The space was really clean and comfortable as well as filled with many snacks and beverages which were a nice treat after a busy day! These hosts go above and beyond to make sure you have a great time!
19331975,338168527,2018-10-18,43151046,Yvonne,"Spencer is an awesome host he was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for him.
The loft apartment is spacious and feels more like an upmarket hotel than an Airbnb location is just a five minute walk from the BART station which takes you straight into San Francisco.
If in the future we return to SF we will most definitely be revisiting Spencer and his lovely family."
6092596,359425066,2018-12-16,2956851,Arda,Great apartment close to all the awesome restaurants in the mission. in addition you are super close to Dolores park. Very clean apartment and easy check-in
424846,486505814,2019-07-12,5875274,Marieke,Lovely! Greath home and host - and defintely try the local restaurant Lokma!
12905538,357246222,2018-12-09,45944609,Greg,"Freya is a great hostess offering a very clean and comfortable place to stay.  I really appreciated her pre-stay communication. Very easy check in and everything that we could have needed was at our disposal 
Thanks Freya"
8987674,77961497,2016-06-04,2713955,Brooke And Travis,"Pam's place was just lovely. Super comfortable bed and plenty of privacy for a ""private room"" rather than an entire house. Great goffee and croissants in the morning. Pam was extremely informative about San Francisco and had great restaurant recommendations. The house was easy to find and in a great quite location! I hope to stay again! "
57479,985017,2012-03-10,1313910,Leanne,"Wonderful house in a great location. We defiantly will stay there again. Finding parking was the only issue we encountered but that problem exist throughout San Francisco.

4287481,182422824,2017-08-14,22300192,John,Incredibly clean great location wonderful hosts overall. Could not recommend enough!!
3718865,71930772,2016-04-29,8828155,Andie,We had a great time staying with Katie! The apartment is clean cozy and private. My husband and I stayed there for 4 days and were very comfortable. The living room is bright and sunny the bathroom was very clean with a nice large shower and the bedroom was nice and dark (awesome if you are trying to catch up on sleep from traveling and aren't on the sun's schedule yet). It is a little far from San Fran's main attractions if you don't have a vehicle but we ended up renting one after a few days and it isn't a bad drive. We only saw Katie once but she was very friendly and helpful she has a lot of love for her city and tons of good tips on things to do! Also the coffee she provides is quite good.
6543813,261694037,2018-05-06,183317173,Alexander,Leonard is a great host. I enjoyed our interesting conversations a lot. The room was very clean and in a good location.
7065335,495921774,2019-07-26,51270010,Jeff,Great place and location great communication with hosts and super friendly. This house has a lot of character and love great for families.
21396964,249110739,2018-04-01,28570847,Susanne,We did not meet Joseph in person but the communication and the check-in went quite well. The room was as described comfy tidy and well equipped. It is in a quiet and safe area a little up the hill with great view in the south of the city. By metro we reached the city center in around 30 minutes. We could definitely recommend to stay at Joseph‘s place!
20169868,438458288,2019-04-16,191282725,Terri,Tyler’s place was very nice and comfortable. It was roomy and convenient to Golden Gate Park area. Very clean modern and stylish. Had nice books about San Francisco that I wish I’d taken more time to read. Would definitely stay here again.
5162669,55023957,2015-11-27,2210947,Dave,Carol made us feel very welcome indeed. Her beautiful apartment is in a fantastic neighbourhood. The bars and restaurants of Cortland Ave are a 5min walk away (down the hill) and Bernal Heights park is even closer in the other direction (left and up the hill) with amazing views across the city. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Recommended.
1033754,9516645,2014-01-01,8837755,Elizabeth  (Liz),"We recently completed a 4 day stay at Jennifer and Eric's home and had a wonderful time.  Everything was very clean and the hosts kindly left a binder with tons of information.  It was evident that Jennifer and Eric really wanted us to enjoy our stay and feel as if their home was ours while we were there.  I had a few questions during our stay we communicated primarily via texting and the resposnse was prompt and very friendly.  

They had a very nice size backyard as we were there in December and although the weather was unseasonly warm my husband and I did not spend too much time out there but our kids used the trampoline each day-in fact the kids SF highlights was the trampoline and riding cable cars.  For those who may happen to need a summer rental and if this is available rent it - nice size backyard plenty of seating and there is a gas grill there. Great place to start the day with a cup of coffee or end with a glass of wine.

We narrowed this area of SF specifically based on recommendations from family - we had heard about the nightmares of trying to find a parking space in other areas and we were not interested in an apt setting we wanted a quiet home to return to at the end of each day cook a meal if we tired of eating out - they have a very nicley upgraded kitchen with everything you may need or just chill with the added convenience of parking and this home met that goal.

Additionally a huge thanks to other Airbnb's who took the time to write about their experiences at this property when renting something sight unseen my initial decision to rent here was based on the many great reviews and then once Jennifer and I started communicating we were in good hands.

8276309,148940725,2017-05-01,5985840,Thom,A lovely room in a genuinely nice house in a great area with really friendly helpful down-to-earth hosts; what AirBnB is all about! Would easily recommend it to others. No more than 15 minutes in an Uber to anywhere you want to go in SF was a perfect location to stay for the weekend. Thanks again to Nathan for having me!
3549398,84864387,2016-07-09,77929270,Kern,Michael was an absolutely wonderful host! He made my stay very comfortable provided options for me to have in order to make snacks and breakfast and was very thorough with any directions and logistics during my stay in SF. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at his place. 
11100926,401506753,2019-01-14,27893119,Katharina,The guest suite in Bernal Hights is a good place to explore the city. It is close to public transport stations the bed is truly very comfortable and there is some space to relax. Communicating with Yael was easy and effective. Thanks for the nice stay.
1336998,21848789,2014-10-25,3775854,Uygar,Doug was very hospitable and friendly. His recommendations about my short stay was very helpful. The breakfast with fresh fruits and home made muffins were noteable. The location is very good there are very nice restaurants and cafes nearby.

16336782,170519236,2017-07-15,16060749,Paul,"We were very pleased with our stay and found it just as described.  Renita was helpful and friendly and the location was very appealing to us since we don't mind morning fog and really enjoyed the proximity to the GG park ocean and Chinese shopping district.  If you have a car make sure the narrow ""tandem"" garage works for you and your car."
31076360,511756188,2019-08-17,61964352,Piers,Alexander’s Place was great for a long stay. Very private and very quiet. In Nob Hill so close to everything. Good value for basically an entire apartment.
2927781,412917114,2019-02-16,181023512,Gregoire,Charles et René sont des hôtes très avenants tout était parfaitement propre. Je ne peux que recommander cette adresse.
467507,1347102,2012-05-25,5498,Eddie & Joanie,The studio apartment is brand new and excellent for short term stays - full kitchen medium size porch to eat breakfast. Jen and Fritz know SFC and want to help you find your way around. Fritz brews tasty beer.   There is a park a few steps away w/ a kids playground.  We hung out in the park w/ neighbors watching the semi-eclipse of the sun. Apartment is a few blocks from the mural filled Mission district - a must see.  Laundromat is one block away.  Parking - Only had to go once around the park to find parking day or night; but prepare for parking on SFC hills.  Overall a very good experience with thoughtful hosts.
16859985,164288446,2017-06-26,68150286,Stephen,This was our first time using Airbnb and Mel ensured that the experience exceeded our expectations. Their home was a perfect fit for us and exactly as described. It is as comfortable as it is beautiful and the Mission serves as a great launching point to see all of the city. From the tips to the check in process communication with Mel was effortless. Our family's first time in San Francisco could not have been better and Mel and Ryan's wonderful home is a large reason why.   
8048653,99970424,2016-09-06,79017922,Mariah,Perfect! Great location. Beautiful modern layout with just enough space. Would recommend to anyone looking to explore downtown area... Golden Gate Bridge fisherman's wharf etc. 
1407244,324237016,2018-09-16,115043672,Joao,This apartment is really stunning. It’s full of Victorian charm and character and is located in a convenient location. Local restaurants and shops are charming and the host was very accommodating. Large bedrooms plenty of storage everything works. It’s a great choice.
5299538,42843996,2015-08-16,21982718,Nicky,"My stay with Zain and Duncan couldn't have been better. They were everything you could ask for in hosts and more - from the moment you walk in the door you feel comfortable in this space with these warm welcoming awesome guys.

The house itself is a great base for exploring all that SF has to offer. The location is perfect within The Mission - a fun and funky area to explore. The house/room was always clean the bed comfortable the communal bar stocked the kitchen functional - the whole set up worked really well. Had a great time with the other guests - this space seems to encourage a really friendly environment where everyone just gets along. Perfect for a solo traveler like me!

Do yourself a favour if you're traveling through SF and stay here!"
87640,510225109,2019-08-15,204042830,Janye,Karin is thoughtful and communicative. The room is adorable and has an adjacent garden that is absolutely stunning!

Both Zain and Duncan are accomodating carefree individuals with a wealth of knowledge about the eclectic city that is San Francisco. Couldnt ask for more from hosts and would recommend them to anyone! 

When I return this is where I'll be coming to again. "
32072704,474044853,2019-06-22,104194535,Vania,Staying at Barbara's place was amazing! She kept the pantry stocked with great breakfast items and the apartment was lovely and clean. She was so welcoming and helpful with anything we needed. Her apartment is very close to restaurants and bars and convenient transportation. I would absolutely stay there again.
533627,542852636,2019-10-06,7513644,Guillaume,We had a great stay. The place is very big and the garden has a great view on the city that you can admire from the hot tub.
11191951,321163542,2018-09-09,15284237,Allison,This AirBnB was great. The location was perfect for us and pretty close to all of the activities we had planned. The apartment is very cute and super well-equipped with accommodating extras and considerate touches. We would absolutely stay here again when visiting SF. Also Jeff and Matt are extremely friendly and kind people!
713877,263741593,2018-05-12,50324028,Beka,"My husband and I absolutely loved this location! The house is great with an amazing view of the city. It's far enough away from downtown that it's quiet at night but there is plenty to do within walking distance and it's only a quick trip to get to all of the tourist hot spots like the bridges and Alcatraz. Stacey is a great host and had everything that you need for your stay. The communication was excellent. There's also a space to store luggage before or after checking out. We took advantage of it on our last day when we had to catch a red eye. A note about the stairs - My husband and I are in our 20s and thought ""oh they won't be so bad"" but they were exactly as described. We were in the final few days of a  10 day trip and had a lot of stuff so lugging that up the stairs was no joke. However it was absolutely worth it for us. If you don't have any major mobility problems the stairs shouldn't deter you from the trip. Just be prepared. Highly recommend staying here!"
7989636,121375577,2016-12-16,29529303,Alex,Our trip was great and lindy was a very accomodating host. The bed was more comfortable than our own!

It’s own truly private home in the heart of the mission right below Bernal heights park. Really comfortable home and I would surely stay there again if I had to return to San Francisco. Huge kitchen too.....
746079,6617595,2013-08-19,7071955,Francesca,We spent in san francisco 3 nights and Ian's condo is perfect for position and beauty. Ian is kind and helpful. We strongly recommend to stay here.

34606745,522267318,2019-09-01,31986237,Mackenzie,Stylish place that’s steps away from a Muni stop. Super convenient location for getting around the city and enjoy a splurge weekend at the same time!
29852330,568789402,2019-11-24,131897164,Marcus,Such an amazing place. I can't sing it's praises enough. If you are a traveler who doesn't mind bunking than there isn't a better more centrally placed option available. Close to most everything on this side of the bridge. Great staff too and the things that this place provides are way above and beyond any unorganized operation. I only wish that I could support them more.
15929798,158850709,2017-06-08,130778516,Mya,Barbara's place was absolutely ideal for anyone's stay in San Francisco. My boyfriend and I felt so welcome and safe. She was very helpful and so accommodating! Whenever we visit again she will be our first choice for sure. 
728884,156900763,2017-06-01,61872876,"JOANN ""Kahi N Cullen""",This place was perfect for my family's first San Fran visit! Our travel party included my husband 3 children (12 10 & 2yrs) and my parents. The house has all the comforts of home and the location is ideal. The store across the street was very convenient as well as the Whole Foods a couple blocks away. The BART & cable car/bus stops are close. Castro Street has great has great food & adult shopping. Dolores park which is close was great and the kids thoroughly enjoyed spending the afternoon there.

Thank you Cynthia and Steve!"
1460628,554598492,2019-10-26,294109650,Byron,Great location and a very comfortable bed. The kitchen area was good and the bathroom has no storage. Living room was nice but has no TV which would be nice for local news and weather forecast. Sleeping area has a bit of an ant/spider issue. Unit is noisy and will be a problem for light sleepers. The area is perfect. Restaurants bus lines and proximity to Golden Gate Park is what really makes this place appealing.
8685716,83551727,2016-07-03,79867170,Cinthia,Perfect area to stay in close to bars and shopping stores. Staff was fantastic. 
1556680,494160574,2019-07-23,53302940,Jason,The pictures were misleading because the fire pit area and backyard was portrayed to be a nicer area to hang out.

16330378,171515136,2017-07-17,2373643,Geebin (Gigi),I chose this property because it was the closest one available to the City College that can accommodate me and my friends at an affordable rate and nice accommodations. We  were attending for a 4 day weekend dance congress. I had a group of 5 adults (25-35) and we were all comfortable. I got what I expected from reading their ad and looking at the photos.  the neighborhood is quiet. it is easily walk-able to grocery and restaurants that are all affordable.  The entrance is a key code making it super easy to get in and out for 5 adults with different schedules.  The house looks just like the pictures shown. the beds are comfortable the sheets are soft! the toilet paper is soft thick and not the thin cheap kind.  The shampoos provided were organic.  The kitchen amenities were plentiful and abundant with nice stuff.  Though we did take out if you needed to cook...you can definitely cook a feast.  I didn't go see the backyard but its super cute and they got a healthy veggie garden.  The neighborhood is quiet and easy to get a lyft from.  Their communication before our arrival and during our stay was so fast and helpful.  You can tell they are all about hospitality and making sure your stay is comfortable and they care.  They really care about giving great customer service. Thank you for such a pleasant stay.  
13239943,156247169,2017-05-29,38982152,Beverly,The innkeeper were really very helpful in helping me sort my bookings prior to the trip as I had to book 3 rooms. Everyone was very friendly and helpful in giving us suggestions of where to go

Beautiful location on Potrero Hill with a great view cozy little room with shared bathroom (with the other room across the hall) but feels very private and homey. Great place for a weekend overnight in SF!!! Raina is a great host!
6505426,76271900,2016-05-26,71865346,Asher,"A very enjoyable stay in great San Francisco area. Jeffery and Huib (the hosts) were very friendly easy to talk to and gave great advice on what to see and how to get around. 

The room was upstairs with a living area (with sofa bed) a separate bathroom and a bedroom with a comfortable queen bed. It's located in the loft above the main part of the house so you don't feel like you are getting in the hosts way. The whole house is well appointed and full of great art. 

It would be hard to get a better location. Quick walk to 24th for a lot of great restaurants and it's also close to the Castro subway station. 

I had no complaints with the stay with this host and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in San Francisco. "
4075971,70759816,2016-04-20,16775673,Gil,"Wonderful home. Spacious living room dining room bedrooms. Having 2 toilets is a big advantage.

The maintenance is excellent.  Clean no dust no stains.  
Location is south to the center about 15 min by car.  Parking available.  Bobbie answers any message in less than 30 minutes.  We recommend the place!!!!"

31494299,480891184,2019-07-03,176950679,Anne,This was a very pleasant place to stay and we were happy to find such an affordable place in such a great location. The room is appealing and spacious as advertised and our 13 year old son enjoyed having his own space in the loft. Philippine provided clear information and instructions for self check in. The beds have futon mattresses so may not be soft enough for some but for us it was fine and we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We would  happily stay here again if we take another trip to San Francisco.
1056844,520596693,2019-08-30,75800379,Jim,Chantal & Louie are very nice people. The location can't be beat and definitely a great value in a city that is one of the most expensive in the country!

4365969,46162553,2015-09-08,39917777,Moniek,"We hebben 4 nachten bij Leslie en Rick gelogeerd in het appartement op de benedenverdieping. Het is een heerlijk appartement; ruim en het heeft alles wat je nodig hebt. Ook was het heerlijk dat we gebruik konden maken van de tuin. Ook super handig dat we de auto in de garage kwijt konden. Met de BART ben je zo in de stad. Je kunt er niet alle delen van de stad mee bereiken maar dat was niet zo erg.

Leslie had van tevoren inkopen gedaan voor wat ontbijtspullen en we kregen een cadeaukaart van een leuk zaakje vlakbij het BART station om meer ontbijt te halen koffie thee en een bagel. Leslie was zelf een weekend weg met de kinderen maar Rick heeft ons hartelijk onthaald en een hele introductie gegeven. Op de dag van vertrek hebben we Leslie zelf nog ontmoet een hele enthousiaste en aardige dame. 

We raden dit appartement zeker aan voor een super verblijf in San Francisco!

13175533,167183508,2017-07-05,130382992,Marc,A very nice comfy place in the Outer Sunset District... walking distance to Golden Gate Park and the ocean. The neighborhood is very quiet and laid back. The weather can be cool and cloudy at times however there are many nice coffee houses close by to keep one warm and toasty. Simone and Simon have the place furnished with everything one needs to make for a comfortable stay. This is a very charming place to spend a few days in the OSD.

The proximity to the beach and the local coffee shops in Outer Sunset were really excellent. Barbara was a responsive host and their place was clean and homey. One thing to look out for- parking can be sparse around the area so make sure to read all signs carefully!
Overall- our trip was unforgettable and our place to stay was a big part of it"

Great and convenient location nicely furnished with ample and generous amenities. We didn’t get to meet Edmund but Andrea the co-host is very helpful and friendly. One of the best part is the free parking in their garage this is a real nice treat in a popular residential neighborhood! Will definitely book and stay here again in our future visits! Thanks
1984709,32343448,2015-05-17,30072571,Emily,"Robby and Nona's suite was a comfortable and cozy place to stay. We appreciated all the extra touches that made it feel like home. The walk-through we got when we first arrived provided us with helpful hints to make the most of our trip. We would definitely recommend staying here if you're looking to escape the busy city but remain close enough for easy access.

746079,37954736,2015-07-12,14320975,Marina,We stayed for a week in San Francisco and Ian's place was perfect for us. Great location close to many cafes and bars. The room is very spacious and comfortable. Ian is a great host he provided us with everything we needed from towels and fresh bed sheets to tiny  details such as rain jackets and cutlery. I would highly recommend Ian's place to anyone travelling to San Francisco!
2694526,169238859,2017-07-11,34817553,Ignacio,"The Beach Retreat@Golden Gate was just perfect.  We arrived without any hassles around noon.  The house was very clean  nicely decorated and smelled great considering a large dog is a permanent resident.  The bed was very confortable  we felt right at home with the plush down comforter.  The bathroom was very clean and sharing it was not a problem.  Water pressure was very strong a the water heater flawless.  Location was amazing  one block away from Golden Gate Park and 5 minutes by Uber to most places we visited.  Around the corner there are great places to eat breakfast before heading out into the City.  All in all we highly recommend the Beach Retreat@Golden Gate Park.  Viviane Lele and Milo were great hosts even though the were in the house for a brief moment during our visit. They even let us keep the luggage in the house till later in the evening so we could enjoy our last afternoon in SFO.  On our next visit we will definitely try to stay here again.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

It’s easy to get in and out and the room and the place has just what you need. Expect the low ceilings but if you’re under 6 feet tall you’re just fine!

6748645,89693318,2016-07-29,59222506,David,"We arrived at Peggy's place at the end of a three-week road-trip across the USA in July taking in everywhere from Texas to California. 
(We are a family of four from the UK with two teenage boys.)
The house was nothing short of perfect for our final stopover before returning to Blighty. Clean tidy spacious airy and most welcoming for four weary travellers!
And the icing on the cake was Peggy herself: throughout all communications and when we eventually arrived in SF Peggy was the font of all knowledge ensuring that we maximised our fun-to-available-time ratio. We even got a lesson in street parking 'San Francisco-style' from Peter Peggy's husband.
Top marks all round. "

C'était parfait pour quelques jours à San Francisco."
5536512,124818630,2017-01-02,26709593,Yi,We had a wonderful stay. Ken and Mark gave us the best New Year welcome with their hospitality. They took time to explain the city to us and made us breakfast and refreshment. We were very pampered. It's a true Airbnb experience not to be missed! 
496226,13140338,2014-05-20,13665108,Ellen," Pam and Albie's flat on Vermont was perfect for my needs. It's a comfortable space in a relatively quiet neighborhood near transportation and amenities. My family was nearby a healthy walk over the hill. 
Access on my arrival was very easy. One day I somehow locked myself out of the flat but a backup plan was carried out and a spare key was available when I came back at the end of the day. No worries!
While I never needed to prepare anything more elaborate than tea and toast the kitchen was well equipped. The bed was very comfortable. I stayed a while so the big closet was a plus. The bathroom is not close to the bedroom but had plenty of towels and hot water.

Albie and Pam are accommodating hosts who have clearly put a lot of care into their rental. They were helpful and welcoming to this visitor."
3946571,46115984,2015-09-08,31043810,Doug,"Lisa is a great host. Not only does she provide insight and directions to local attractions but has a great selection of maps and other city literature.  The home was exactly as advertised. Victorian home that is clean and centrally located. The bed and pillows are very comfortable. 
My wife and I are  amazed at Lisa's home made preserves and scones.
We would definitely stay here again.

2509236,178070978,2017-08-04,125086697,Carl,Awesome little room. Wouldn't recommend for long term visits as it is a bit small but it's perfect for a couple of days. Great neighborhood/proximity to transit.

Though they had mentioned foot noise upstairs from kids it didn't bother me and they were very considerate. Fresh fruits energy bars and bottled water along with Pete's coffee was a great touch to kick off the day. I would definitely stay back with Lajja on my next trip.

21594483,512960335,2019-08-18,925119,Maaike,This is a very good place when you stay in San Francisco. Nice neighbourhood close to the beach and park. Silent at night. Great host very friendly. Rent some bycicles close to the apartement and eat at San Tung. We had a great time!
6316753,198839323,2017-09-30,144442717,Vanessa,Jia's place is exactly what I was looking for.  I needed a private quiet space near public transportation that allowed me to get around easily.  Jia provided toiletries and kitchen essentials (even though I didn't use them) and made sure I was taken care of.  Jia also provides her Safeway card to allow for a discount if you choose to go grocery shopping at the market next door.  Thanks for being a wonderful host Jia!

664307,2737449,2012-10-28,3595976,Haakon,"Beth & Geoff's room is small but really cosy. I was really impressed by their attention to detail. They've laid out tons of great information about the area on the nightstand. The room was stocked with water bottles chocolate apples shampoo etc.
Geoff was really helpful through messages and helped me out with information even after I had left their place (I was still in SF).
I really loved the area the location is great. It's definitely in the coolest part of the Mission but the street is still nice and quiet. Easy access to all kinds of transportation (BART is only a block and a half away).

4902907,506536773,2019-08-10,62126286,Nicholas,Great location! Communication with Tony was easy and helpful.
8207665,169215063,2017-07-11,112192117,Susan,Was a fun place to stay. We were out most of the day so didn't really get a chance to use all the nice things Carol had available. We found we were driving distance to all the tourist attraction. However I also enjoyed all the potential of cooking/chef games and tourist/fiction books. So this is a great stay if you have adventuresome people and more cooks or couch potatoes (readers) in your group. I could have used a day or 2 to do just that.  Nice quite neighborhood but withing walking distance of some coffee shops and neighborhood markets.
53934,49417518,2015-10-04,23599725,Justin,Manny and Megan were fantastic hosts and provided us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay in San Francisco. Manny greeted us at the apartment and provided us with some great local info. The apartment is an easy walk to the main public transport hub and was nice and secure. The rooftop area was an added bonus and was a great place for a drink whilst looking out over the city. The complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates were also a great touch.
25662,18707333,2014-08-31,13761408,Andreu,"We have had a very pleasant stay in SF thanks to all ""comodities"" that Gayl and Paul's flat have! A very sofisticated and automated way of entering securely the flat and all kind of things that we needed Paul was there to help or guide us!

The neighborhood is very quiet and at same time near the center (via tram bus) or if you bring a car there is room at the street and if not Paul or Gayle will tell all secrets for safe parking without being towed.

Thanks!!!"
13714899,96795208,2016-08-24,5419118,Shannon,I stayed in Marci's cottage on the same property prior to my stay in the flat. Both experiences were picture perfect. Book either one of these places for a quiet comfortable stay in a great neighborhood!

23209264,532956254,2019-09-20,92652318,Caroline,"Appartement très bien équipé propre. L'isolation n'est pas top de par le bruit des voisins. Linda en est consciente et fait le nécessaire pour les minimiser.
Il est situé dans un quartier où l'insécurité règne. Nous sommes passés à pied dans le quartier pour aller vers le centre de San Francisco et dans les alentours de l'appartement et on a rencontré beaucoup de SDF et de personnes avec des comportements étranges. Linda en est également consciente et explique les routes à prendre pour les éviter et pouvoir rejoindre le métro. Nous avons préféré utiliser Uber les jours suivants."
1774026,492976400,2019-07-21,40410000,Luisa,"No kidding about being at the top of Liberty Hill. The views from the department were great! On a foggy morning we could the lights from the Bay Bridge at night AT&T park's. Being that close from BART and MUNI was super useful.

The department had enough space for all of us. Just a few details that could need some maintenance:
- Bathroom: using the shower was kinda of a struggle it is hard to close it properly without asking for help from the fittest or strongest person of the group.
- Some doors squeak.
- We couldn't get the (Hidden by Airbnb) Home device to work. The only way to turn off the lights from the room at the end of the hall was to turn down both switches. Not a big deal just inconvenient of you wanted to charge your phone at night.

Besides that the department is absolutely beautiful :)"
2166428,101683309,2016-09-14,62805134,Eric,Tisa's apartment was perfect for our brief stay in San Francisco.  It was right in the Haight-Asbury district within walking distance to many bars and restaurants.  The apartment itself was well furnished and very comfortable.  Admittedly we didn't spend much time within the apartment itself because we were in town to visit friends and see the city but when we needed to retreat and relax it was perfect for just that.

Over all a perfect place for travelers who wants to say a neat place in central San Francisco with limited budget as long as you can ignore the loud music from night clubs near by.

The home is safe super clean well appointed and comfortable. I was not around much but felt welcome and appreciated the few times Mia greeted me asking for a pet.

Bed was comfortable private and lighting in room worked."
9051149,337280554,2018-10-15,27815564,Robin,My boyfriend and I had a very pleasant time staying at Elmer's flat. Elmer was very quick at communicating so we had no problems checking in. When we arrived we we're welcomed by his lovable dog London (I miss him already). The flat was expected with extra bonuses like a fully equipped bathroom (Yes! Feminine products too!) just in case you forgot something. The bedroom was equipped with other amenities like a storage space extra towels pillows blankets bath robes luggage scale and make up remover wipes! The bed was so comfy I just wanted to sleep in longer. Also the location is in a fairly safe and clean neighborhood. Walking distance to a lot of coffee shops and restaurants. I will definitely stay at his place again the next time we come back to visit.

13021568,108627494,2016-10-16,2228992,Amanda,Peihong is a very nice host and has a very nice place to stay. The bus just around the corner will take you to the city center easily. I would definitely choose Peihongs place again!

Thanks to them we had a small taste of what it feels like to be a local in San Francisco.
15075530,151976443,2017-05-14,12302013,McKenzie,"The space was really cute beds were super comfortable! The location was not ideal very little to walk to. The checkin process was easy. 

After you get the keys enter through a security gate (all the houses in this area have them). Go down about 7-8 stairs to the main entrance. Entrance opens into a bedroom. Walk through that room to the living and dining room. Up a few stairs to kitchen bathroom and another bedroom (with access to outdoor washer and dryer). Second bedroom didn't have a deadbolt or other security feature.  

Fridge was stocked with water and bathroom had ample toilet paper. There's also a dispenser in the shower with shampoo conditioner and body wash plus plenty of towels. Shower had awesome water pressure and plenty of hot water. 

Wouldn't rush to book again but wouldn't avoid either. "

Rob has a well kept clean home and thoughtful touches for the guests including coffee snacks bathroom supplies/towels and a comfortable queen size standard bed and a full size inflatable bed.

It was close to public transport but we still felt that we were quite far from downtown. Otherwise I can't really complain. The place was really clean and well equipped! In case you need parking it might get a little difficult but we were lucky as Robert managed to reserve us a spot. Luckily we used public transport so we didn't have to move the car at all. I loved the Wi-Fi. It had a good speed and it was reliable! All in all great place to stay at!
8762967,304545855,2018-08-09,45774431,Tracey,Adam’s place is a bit out of the way from tourist attractions but close to different gems in it’s own neighborhood. The place is stylish and quaint with an extremely comfortable bed after all the walking around San Fran!  Hosts left a great list of recommendations around the area for everything you could possibly need.  Our schedules didn’t overlap so unfortunately we did not meet our hosts but their hospitality during our stay was greatly appreciated. 
929468,160154107,2017-06-12,8670740,Maryam,We were a group of four women that stayed at John's place. It was a lovely and comfortable stay. John's loft was big enough to comfortably accommodate all four. The loft has a well-functioning kitchen as well as bathroom. The neighborhood is beautiful! Although it's not close to a BART station it's well-connected by bus and about a 20 minute walk to the lively Castro strip and about a 25-minute walk to Haight. It's a safe scenic neighborhood with lovely views of the city. John was also a very responsive host - he was very quick to respond to our requests and queries. Thank you John!

11845487,497763235,2019-07-28,11222262,Silvia,The flat is really well appointed with a fully equipped kitchen. Overall a really nice space in a great location. One thing to consider is the noise - it was pointed out in other reviews but despite being from the middle of a city we weren’t quite prepared for the level of it ranging from daily running and jumping to washing machines/tumble driers until after 10pm during our last night. If you stay here take earplugs.
2016198,326165863,2018-09-21,108568435,Natalie,"The accommodation was clean and lovely. You have access to the downstairs of the house which includes the bedroom bathroom and a kitchenette area. Char and Rus were incredibly generous with stuff in the kitchenette. For example they provided cereal bars yoghurts cereals milk drinks snacks etc. 
They also kindly let us use their push bikes which we used to cycle to Sausalito which is a town I would really recommend you visit. 
There are local takeaways and restaurants within walking distance of the house and there is a welcome guide which explains this to you in the room. 
I would certainly recommend Char and Rus as hosts :)"

We particularly liked the TV sound system and use of Netflix!! It's bright and spacious yet warm and cozy! It was lovely and clean and perfectly described by the host!! The kitchen is fully equipped and Reed was very generous in allowing us to help ourselves to tea and coffee etc...! The beds were a delight and having the use of 2 bathrooms made it a really comfortable stay for four!!  The location was fine the neighbourhood was safe and quiet. It's a good 25 minute walk into town though so I would advise getting the bus!! The bus stops at the bottom of the road and was very convenient so don't let the location put you off! Reed was a perfect host and his communication was superb! All in all we loved our stay and would just like to thank Reed for being so accommodating!! Thank you!

The cottage itself was nice and clean. Carrie was out of town while we were there so we never met but the check-in and check-out process was very convenient.

6628985,545178593,2019-10-11,4977929,Barbara,Had a great time at Sylvie’s place! She was communicative a wonderful host and fast to respond. I really appreciated the small touches like the chocolate apples and water!
19417708,448957852,2019-05-05,174465713,Zestty,The place is in a nice area. Plenty of street parking food nearby and easy access. The unit has its own entrance with a motion light. His instructions about how to access the unit were easy to follow. There wasn’t a tv there and the hard wood floors kind of echo so I was worried about bring too loud because the owners live upstairs. Otherwise it was reasonably priced. I would definitely come back again because of how easy it was it really simplified my trip. Thank you for having us!!
545685,210161339,2017-11-07,109850263,Caroline,We had a great stay at Su‘s garden suite. The apartment was exactly what the pictures show and we enjoyed our two nights there a lot. It was very clean and we were comfortable staying there. Communication was easy through text and airbnb text. We took uber to travel into the city and back but there is busses along Balboa Ave that can be used to get into the city. You‘ll always find a good place to eat around the apartment. We can recommend Hunan Cafe 2 for Chinese food which is a 5min uber drive from the apt. We can definitely recommend staying there.
28363410,525380107,2019-09-07,34647059,Dr. Birgit,I stayed with Clive for two weeks and did have such a terrific time! He was very friendly and hospitable indeed  everything went smoothly and perfectly fine. I had a marvelous room with enough space slept perfectly well. Mission is a great area to dive into if you like the melting pot atmosphere (which I do ). Would love to come back.! Thanks again :)
3534282,473525673,2019-06-21,39367090,Jonathan,Great location particularly for food and nightlife. Clean bedroom and shared bathroom.
4663060,547731119,2019-10-15,2398050,Allahna,Mark's guest suite was a perfect location to explore the city. A nice quiet neighborhood but close to everything! It was a great value for the size locations and amenities. Mark was also a great host and super accommodating with any requests.
3870174,66885356,2016-03-25,32017346,Angela,We had an amazing stay at Jason and Jacks house. The guys are so accommodating warm and friendly.  The house is amazing clean and spacious. The king bed is probably one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept in too. Thanks again guys. We would definitely recommend this to any people visiting SF. 
10379560,260373952,2018-05-04,60138664,Julie,We had a great stay in San Francisco. Bus stop a half block away was perfect since we used public transportation while visiting. Walked to the beach a few times...beautiful! It was quiet for the most part with occasional pitter patter of the dogs walking around which was actually comforting being dog people and missing ours at home.
38416451,550937422,2019-10-19,79059537,Afnan,Great location!
19658833,210474501,2017-11-09,15957143,John,Had a wonderful stay in Cheryl's beautiful home. The master suite is spacious and very comfortable. The private bathroom is modern and nice touches are included such as a coffee/tea maker. I was visiting SF for a work conference and I very much appreciated the quiet residential location. Cheryl was very friendly and accommodating. Thank you Cheryl!
6529234,134534976,2017-02-27,96221532,Michelle,"I love the place and the neighborhood as I prefer not to stay in hotels when I'm on vacation.  As uber and lyft are rampant going to places is not a challenge just need to plan your schedule properly to save on transpo costs. Adrian has been a kind host always available to respond to questions instantly. The studio is suitable for a single person or a couple very clean and homey. 

As recommended going to bernal heights park is a must. We've managed to trek there a couple of times. Running around the neighborhood was a highlight as well."
16362304,527378941,2019-09-10,63347430,Jinyu,We enjoyed staying at Harris' home. Location was great with easy access to Golden Gate Park Presidio and the Geary and Balboa street shops. The place was very clean and spacious. Harris was accommodating and made us feel welcomed.
1482730,366558711,2019-01-02,13380939,Kristen,So grateful to have found Jennifer's space. I needed a last minute place for my visiting parents. It was perfect.  She was very sweet and helpful in making this happen for us. thanks again!
845501,113418178,2016-11-12,27030962,Bledar,"Old house and very basic with several rooms and one shared bathroom. The whole house is only used for b&b. It smells and the carpets are dirty. 
Ghost host (we never saw her - which is fine actually) was responsive via email. 
Noisy as the first floor neighbor (below) is heard talking all the time day/night. 
Neighborhood looks rough."
1995487,198831063,2017-09-30,5470996,Hyelim,"Perfect stay as always. 
I love the spacious loft the shower and the fireplace. 
Right in the center of Mission it's walking distance to many great restaurants and Bi-rites.
Michael and Luis were perfect hosts prompt in responding to questions and ready to help with any requests.
Always will be my first choice when I'm in SF. :)"
5007358,452177034,2019-05-12,160095637,Leslie,This was in the perfect location. Close to the stadium and union square with many restaurants and bars close by. Check in was extremely easy parking was a little harder to find without paying a meter the building was very quiet. Everything I needed for an overnight stay was available in the room/bathroom.
24890095,342916135,2018-10-29,47912004,Carlie,Absolutely loved yijias place! He was very hospitable check in was a breeze (and we checked in at 1 am because of a late flight and that was not a problem at all!!) and it had everything we needed for our two night stay. The location was also excellent and super close to attractions.
17419327,465916290,2019-06-08,197726492,Yun,Hiromi is a wonderful host. She is very thoughtful and accommodating. Since my flight came in early in the morning and left  in the evening she allowed me to check in early and held my luggage for me after I checked out. The room is very clean. Location is great that is in walking distance to where I needed to go. I enjoyed my stay there and would highly recommend it!
1721354,328260648,2018-09-25,79825315,Miranda,"Andrew’s home is perfect for anyone wanting to stay in a great location close to both cool local spots as well as landmarks. I actually walked from his place to The Painted Ladies (some might not consider it “walking distance” and the walk itself was full of hills but it’s still do-able) and even the Japanese Tea Garden at Golden Gate Park. 

With regard to the actual living space it is clean and extremely homely. The home has unique and personal touches that make the home feel like it is well-lived in which I really liked. And although I didn’t get the chance to cook Andrew’s home is equipped with anything you’d need to cook a meal. 

I unfortunately wasn’t able to meet Andrew when checking in but check-in was easy enough. Andrew was very quick in responding to my questions and messages and checked in with me occasionally to make sure I was OK. As I said to him his hospitality was felt from miles away. He also provided a fantastic list of recommendations to his favorite local food spots as well as the nearest grocery stores. 

I would highly recommend Andrew and his home to anyone visiting San Francisco for the first time (or for the hundredth time)."
17301015,143393874,2017-04-11,37637201,Bew,We stayed here for 4 night. The place was clean and comfortable. Location is quite far from downtown. It takes around more than  1 hr. from downtown by bus. Taking Uber will be better. Host is a bit conservative.
13810224,257574387,2018-04-26,25695542,Rob,Great location in San Francisco. Excellent views and a comfortale apartment. Lochlann made a grat effort to stay in contact and check if there was any way to help me have a better stay. Would recommend.
5581254,281422049,2018-06-24,99974207,Danielle,Great place that is very well located for getting around. Tasty food options close by and close to transport. Kesinee is very welcoming and more than happy to provide local knowledge with a friendly smile! Great find!
8859249,280608180,2018-06-23,180670617,James,"Lovely flat located overlooking the wonderful Golden Gate Park. My wife and our two young children (3&1 years) stayed here and had a great time. It’s a smart and stylish flat superbly located for Golden Gate Park and Ocean Beach plus getting into town is only a short drive away. Everything you need is close by. 

Gary and Erika are attentive and responsive hosts and couldn’t have been more helpful. Highly recommended!"
15675892,140981985,2017-04-01,78935967,Rocco,Great place. It's extremely simple. If you're looking  for a place to sleep and keep your luggage while you're visiting San Francisco this is the perfect place. 
20059569,250959824,2018-04-06,51619771,Tayler,This place is very clean there is an open shared area right outside of the door you have to walk across to get to the two restrooms. The actual room is exactly like the pictures but do not be fooled- it is a FULL and TWIN bed. We had four people and luckily we brought an air mattress not sure how you would fit that many on those two beds. They provided heavy blankets and a few pillows which came in handy.
12835527,77588883,2016-06-02,71354070,Chelsey,Very cute and quaint place to stay. Traci was very knowledgable friendly and gave us lots of privacy. It was a very safe area in a great location.  It was very relaxing and the perfect place to stay while exploring San Fransisco. I wish I could've stayed longer. 
19459929,286672686,2018-07-06,118235293,Theresa,"My husband & I travelled with our two boys  (ages 11 and 13) the week of July 4th. Yuri's place provided the refuge we needed after a whole day of sightseeing and touring. The place is in a quiet residential neighborhood just far away enough from the noises of a bustling city; yet close enough to get to the Wharf AT&T stadium Union Sq. etc for a quick & cheap uber ride. 
Additionally we rented a car for a couple of excursions outside of San Fran and Yuri provided a parking space in the driveway for our rental car at just $15 a day.
We especially enjoyed our complimentary breakfast on the balcony overlooking the city on bright sunny mornings. "
2927781,485902991,2019-07-11,28576156,Josh,I had a great stay! Rene greeted me and is delightful. The bed was super comfy and the shower was great. There is a bit of street noise which was not a problem for me but light sleepers may want to prepare. Luckily Rene and Charles provide easy plugs! I would stay again
8155586,179535229,2017-08-07,4018973,Tim,Kevin rocks great place great communication great all around!

4558898,305068372,2018-08-10,69117805,Tae,Jane and Mr. Frodo are wonderful hosts. The place is impeccable and trendy definitely worth every penny and more! Everything about it was amazing - from the wall painting to the softness of the bed. A+ would definitely come back!

20885900,229284612,2018-01-22,24609720,Andreas,"Heathers place is a true gem. You will not find a greater place nor host than Heather. Great location for walks in the City and many resturants near by.
Very clean and luxurious apartment with great atmosphere. Would come back tomorrow I`d could."

657121,306572192,2018-08-12,14958500,Melissa,This apartment is fantastic. Location ideal view breathtaking and beds so comfortable. I couldn’t recommend it more. Sad to leave. 
4023585,190639173,2017-09-04,128695143,Kevin,After three flight of steps you're greeted with a welcoming family home with comfortable beds kitchen and common areas. Charming San Francisco.
13603043,301731513,2018-08-04,21153105,Tim,"This was everything we were hoping for and more. 

Snacks and wine awaited us on entry and the place was perfect to retire to after long days out and about exploring San Fran. The location was perfect Noe Valley is very close to all the action but far away enough that it’s quiet and chill.

I highly recommend this airbnb listing. "
1206184,10124467,2014-02-01,9664543,Soeren,I had a really pleasant stay. Ashir and Margaret are very welcoming and helpful hosts. My room (#6) was both beautiful and practical with a view over page street and a nice little working space. I really liked the location.
17305040,151963056,2017-05-14,119814393,Benjamin,"Great hideout in San Francisco. 

A great studio apartment with everything you need for a pleasant stay in SF. Loved the neighborhood as well with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Stuart the host was also accessible and accommodating improving our experience remaining non-intrusive and respectful. 

Recently remodeled so everything is brand new. The entrance still has a little bit of work to be done but as we were leaving new flooring was going to be installed so it will be even better for future guests. 

Because we stayed for a whole week we wanted to cook some meals for ourselves instead of going out everyday and Stuart was nice enough to buy the kitchenware that we were missing in the kitchen to be able to do this. 

The location is also great if you rent a car because we had no problem to find were to park for free. 

We will definitely stay again here if we come back to San Francisco. Thanks Stuart! "
7309852,176381770,2017-07-30,48000646,Ben,Maria's place was great for our weekend stay. There was nice amenities like snacks coffee and shampoo. Check-in was easy. Right next to Golden Gate Park! We'd stay here again. 
277339,25598720,2015-01-20,8878492,Beatriz,Although we didn't get to personally meet our hosts they made us feel extremely welcomed and checked in with us via email and texts to inquire whether we needed anything. The accommodations  were excellent: clean comfortable beautiful. It's located in what appeared to be a family-like neighborhood peaceful and safe and with easy access to other parts of the city. We strongly recommend this listing!
9752333,334322108,2018-10-08,21982838,Amelia,Peg & Jeff's place is spacious welcoming and bright.  The high ceiling and skylights over the bed light up the room and the view into the back yard is perfect for making you feel like you're not really in the city. Public transportation was easy to walk to and we never had to wait longer than 5 mins for an Uber if we needed a car.
18850359,176400042,2017-07-30,77531021,Stéphane,Nice home in a quiet street in Mission. A great place to explore the city. 
15769128,148008986,2017-04-29,119155712,Kevin,Overall it was a good stay. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of san francisco so the location alone (for the price) makes it worth it. Don't expect any (not one) amenity. It is primarily just a bed a sink in your room and shared bathroom and shower facilities. Even though this place wasn't luxury it was SUPER clean (everywhere). There wasn't even any dust on the top shelf in the closet or under the bed. What they lack in amenities they made up for in cleanliness.
23613300,536443679,2019-09-26,16149157,Marina,"Great location the nicest part of Turk St.
Super clean room. Comfortable bed and a little kitchen with basic but all new supplies. Unfortunately no view and no TV. It's a small studio in the back of the house. Easy check-in and check out. 
Overall I could stay here again!"
28074409,346179536,2018-11-07,222444653,Vitaliy,"That was a great stay in Erik's apartment!
Very clean renovated and well-maintained home. Lots of thoughtful touches that make you feel like home. And the large windows open really 'Stunning Bay View' - this is indeed the well-deserved description!
The home was prepared for guests exceeding all my expectations.
And the awesome location proximity to lots of attractions and Financial District makes this home a great choice for both business and leisure stays.
Thanks a lot Erik!"
2026910,215288231,2017-11-28,11758046,Liz,Bree and her place are both fantastic! We had the perfect Thanksgiving weekend! The unit is beautifully decorated with no detail overlooked the amenities are second to none and Bree is so warm and welcoming! I am looking forward to our next visit already!
317121,419292222,2019-03-03,59247518,Jenny,I couldn’t have imagined staying in a better Airbnb in the city for the great price! I am a travel RN and his place is a 15 min walk to the hospital. It is located on a quiet street in the haight close to EVERYTHING! Eric was very helpful with anything I needed. Def recommend staying here if you’re passing through the city!
1498953,49124771,2015-10-01,41903415,Ziheng,Sorry we wrote comments late because of our busy traveling schedule. Looking back San Francisco is the favorite stop in our U.S. trip and Anna's house too  is the best living place in our living experience in U.S. First convenient location easy to find from airport near golden gate park and seaside which I think much better than city center where hills are not easy to park or drive. Second comfortable bed and steam bath quiet to sleep. I also played piano a little bit in the living room and used the antique glass to drink wine. Lovely balconies and flowers.  And Anna is very friendly letting you feel so warm and family like. Great memories in San and Anna's house! 
18931048,545600936,2019-10-12,287955385,Greg,Loved the space and solid location in SF. Check in/out were super easy the unit was very clean and the value was great. We very much enjoyed our stay would absolutely recommend to friends!
4670847,509592074,2019-08-14,105282543,Blake,This is my second stay at the Green Tortoise and I honestly wouldn’t stay anywhere else. The staff is friendly and accommodating you meet a ton of interesting people and even if you have to share a dorm with guys you feel comfortable and safe. Thanks for another great time!
10859050,219542094,2017-12-17,162239863,Steve,Outer sunset is the perfect spot to stay in San Fran and it won't get any better than this spot - few blocks from the beach (you can see the water from the living room) right near the transport into city center stylish and spacious and a fab host. I can't wait to go back!
1998111,470997565,2019-06-16,27741862,Nicole,"The home from Kenix is a nice place to stay in San Francisco.
The room was very clean and the kitchen had everything you need to prepare a small meal.
The bus stop is near the apartment and it takes about 45 minutes to get to downtown San Francisco.
I had a great time there."
11437442,226268509,2018-01-09,163702757,K,Appreciated this home and amenities. Everything was very nice  clean  and thoughtful. Quiet street.

23106047,362980868,2018-12-27,36802729,Amanda,"Jayme's place is very quiet and situated near the top of their street with wonderful views of the city. The studio entrance is accessible through their garden which is peaceful and private. The studio offers an efficient kitchen and bathroom that are both simple and updated. There is a large closet to store bags and personal belongings out of the way. It's a nice place to retire to after enjoying a full day of activities in San Francisco. 

From Jayme's place you can easily hike up to Twin Peaks which offers more fantastic views of the city. If you enjoy walking around you'll see lovely homes in their neighborhood to admire while exploring."
59344,450972856,2019-05-10,64974100,Dylan,Overall not a bad place to stay was slightly hard to find and guests for the next day arrived early before our checkout time. Fairly small but gets the job done. Safe neighborhood.
14474493,474025222,2019-06-22,228943889,Catherine,Esther’s place is very clean relaxing and well located. Esther is an incredible host with a great space!

29906297,458227163,2019-05-25,55877528,Kevin,Tammy and Cam is a very friendly host and easy-going. They made my stay feel really like a home. Home was absolutely clean and everything was prepared for me as expected. Location is great. Walking distance to the Muni and easily accessible to the downtown area. I highly recommend Tammy’s place if you’re looking for a stay in SF with relatively affordable price.
15920878,170126721,2017-07-14,38522254,Lance,Quiet  clean  as advertised . Had a great stay Steve was very responsive.

The room was very clean and so was the entire flat. The view is amazing and everything you need is close to Caleb's place.
If I ever come back to San Francisco I'll check if Caleb's apartment is available!"
10603148,141942271,2017-04-05,66318552,航,What else can I say John himself is the biggest asset of this Airbnb. It's a pleasure to talk to him and we instantly become friends. I'm looking forward to go eat at the finest steakhouse with him next time when I'm in San Francisco.
16086843,356604490,2018-12-08,25747515,Adam,The location is great and the price is great. It was not exactly spotless in terms of cleanliness and there is definitely a lot of street noise. I can deal with both of those and for a quick work trip it was perfect. I would NOT stay there with my wife as I'm sure she would not like some of the issues. For the price expectations can't be too high. Might consider paying a little more to stay elsewhere next time but in a pinch I would be fine to stay again.
17606766,435548934,2019-04-10,92313932,Alex,Great location if you like to be off the beaten path to close to the best parts of SF like OB and Golden Gate Park. The furniture beds bathrooms could use an upgrade.
9605720,82153733,2016-06-26,65459609,Emma,Adrian's place is fantastic - right in the heart of China Town and easily accessible for everything with amazing views.  The description and photos are spot on and we would definitely recommend Adrian's place to others.  Would love to come back!
1434314,142521582,2017-04-08,3012229,Heather,This house is as pictured but so much more! The views really do need to be seen to be believed. It's so comfortable and beautiful throughout every room. The location is great for walking to restaurants bars and grocery stores! Alex and Tammi are fabulous hosts and great to communicate with. Highly recommend for family friends or (as was my case) colleagues traveling together.

720811,54905283,2015-11-25,48001024,Hannes,We had a very pleasant stay at Ron & Cherie's Apartment! With a warm and easy welcome and a lot of tips to get to know the area. The location is at a great place near the golden gate park in a peaceful neighborhood. And even for our 14 month old girl we had a excellent place to stay including nice toys to play ;). Thanks a lot Ron & Cherie. Keep running ;)!

6080799,182080234,2017-08-13,428769,Dani,Sara's studio is lovely! It has a really fun beach getaway vibe. Sara clearly put a lot of love into th design and surf inspired decor. Th I place comes with a private entrance laundry kitchenette and great yard.  It's only a couple blocks from the beach and a short walk to great cafes and shops. Sara was really welcoming and helpful. I highly recommend this place!
7182761,428205686,2019-03-24,93502706,Valentina,"I stayed at Brendan's place for a week. First the location is perfect and the area as well. It is so close to the public transportation and to  go Ford bikes. The place is very nice and clean and very private with a private bathroom. So if you are concerned about the privacy do not hesitate about booking it at all. It was amazing.
I would definitely stay there again in the future. 
I had no chance even to meet Brandon in person but he is very easy reachable and responded fast for all of my questions.
:)"
20799337,230042656,2018-01-26,2858650,Catharina,Great setup with two rooms. There is no real kitchen so you're not going to cook (or eat) dinner here but there's a microwave mini-fridge coffee machine etc to get you set up for your day. Fantastic communication very clean and just what I needed as a base for a week of meetings.
16710475,323510814,2018-09-15,12328476,Deanna,Aliah and Matthew are generous hosts.  The room is spacious and clean.  And what a treat to have a hot tub to soak in after walking the city streets for hours--especially those hills!!  The view from the hot tub is spectacular!  Lots of funky restaurants/cafes nearby. Friendly neighbourhood.  Reminded us of Kitsilano (Kits) in Vancouver.
7067087,564387027,2019-11-15,147804067,Brandon,Great value clean friendly staff! I hope to stay here again for my next trip to San Francisco.
2927781,348659589,2018-11-14,39124935,Chris,Charles and Rene are wonderful hosts and have a very cool space. I was visiting SF for a conference and really enjoyed waking up in the morning on the super comfy mattress and then enjoying an awesome cup of coffee from their gourmet coffee maker. Don’t hesitate to book your stay here!
13618517,404582323,2019-01-24,159082947,Harry,Great experience would highly recommend to all!!!!

1480015,65533316,2016-03-15,3940746,Abby & Mark,"The apartment is beautifully renovated well-decorated and very clean. The bed is so comfy and the pullout couch was great to accommodate my mom as well. The kitchen has everything we needed to cook breakfast and store
Food for our stay. It was super quiet despite it being in a building with two other units. Ben is a great host and was available for any questions. He lives next door. The neighborhood couldn't be better - near Haight Ashbury and the very charming Cole Valley. "
21966629,446108860,2019-04-30,67201171,Jessica,Great location in quiet neighborhood. Has everything you would need!
22469468,335286749,2018-10-11,201780680,Zack & Michele,Jun is quite possibly the sweetest person on the planet. My husband and I stayed at her place for 2 nights for our anniversary. Our plane landed early so we arrived a little earlier than expected; they were still cleaning the room. Jun couldn't have been more understanding and welcoming. She invited us upstairs where she had us sit in the kitchen and she made us a light breakfast and made us feel entirely welcome. She also talked with us in detail about how to best get around the city. A few minutes later the room was ready. She sneaked down there and put a brand-new bottle of wine with two glasses on the bed a gift for our anniversary. The room was small but very nice and comfortable with a fridge and a fold-out table + 2 chairs. The bathroom/shower are nice as well and the bed very comfortable. The TV is loaded with shows to watch and the general house noise wasn't loud (to us). Because it was a work week we didn't see them much for the 2 days we were there but she was sure to hug us and thank us upon checking-out. This is an AWESOME get-away with spectacular views and hospitality. It is a little far from places like Fisherman's Warf/Pier 39 but there is plenty of city transportation options to get you to where you want to be... download and use the MUNI MOBILE app; it's amazing. Thank you to Jun and Cedric for a wonderful stay highly recommend!!
7343277,531929924,2019-09-18,56326548,Carlos E.,I totally recommended this place to travellers from any part of the world. It is San Francisco made in house.
23258326,252477217,2018-04-10,120522832,Andrew,Ronil and his girlfriend were excellent hosts. They were very responsive and even let us drop our bags off early. The 855 Brannan Apartment building is an awesome space in a great location ideal for walking to a San Francisco Giants game (took us about 15-20 min). Would highly recommend this for anyone looking to save some money on lodging in SF.
14043110,282954419,2018-06-28,46034663,Silvia,"Allt var bra med själva boendet. Hyggligt stort rum delat kök som hade allt och rena badrum som delas med andra gäster.
Bara läget kändes mindre bra då den inte direkt tillhör stadens bättre områden och detta informerades det inte riktigt om.
Känns som ett generellt AirBnB-problem man behöver kolla upp vilka kvarter man vill/inte vill bo i innan man bokar.
Nåväl det hände inget och det var nära till spårvagn in till staden med mycket intressanta karaktärer ombord."
7226841,528270959,2019-09-12,260243428,Susan,Great location! Very comfortable space super comfortable bed. The apartment is 3 floors up and there is no elevator but this was only a pain when dealing with our luggage otherwise it was fine. Nadia is a great host we would definitely stay here again.
27025,100776663,2016-09-10,50300424,Nadine,Luis Craig and their dog Rocky are awesome and always there for advice! Flat is even bigger than on photos. Great neighborhood. Would love to stay there again. 
4892016,466982576,2019-06-09,135628593,Mark,If you have other options I would not recommend staying here as the room was old in decor and smelled musty.  It is not a place that we should be paying this kind of money to stay at.  The location was great for what we needed so that worked out.  We did have an issue with parking since the motel was full I was parked in a spot at the back of the lot and someone pulled their car in blocking 4 cars from getting out including mine.  So if the motel is full you may not get your car out in the morning.
35238492,511735064,2019-08-17,26670697,Benoit,Very nice Stay at Maddy’s appartment in San Francisco nice view and surroundings !
568161,7549439,2013-09-24,6164865,Cedric,Beth and Don are great hosts! Their place is nice and quiet as well as conveniently located. I can definitely recommend this to anyone :-). 
12522,226633900,2018-01-11,8214946,Assaf,"Great place small room but very comfortable.
Excellent communication location is very nice with 5 minutes walk to the metro."
5007358,147270235,2017-04-25,15652554,Mitra,"This place is cheap and it is in a *central* location but: 1. The tenderloin is not the best neighborhood to be walking around in at night 2. The rooms (at least my room) face O'Farrell street which is a major street and super noisy at all hours of the night; 3. not super clean. I think if you are looking for something that is a step up from a motel this is the right place for you. But if you are looking for a nice place or a quiet place to sleep I wouldn't recommend. 
Communication with Tony was very easy."
16700935,214388901,2017-11-25,69103751,Donna,Jeff s place was nice in a great spot within walking distance of many amenities. Enjoyed our stay!
10137578,78427978,2016-06-06,11549558,Nihar,Christian and his family were very hospitable and we had a great experience!
4359078,352847742,2018-11-25,188558931,Jessica,Pastries and coffee for breakfast. Bed was comfy! Good location!
734839,125643151,2017-01-06,23100531,Robyn,Kenji was a perfect host! friendly & hospitable. All the reviews we read about him being Air BnB's best host are true. He gave us lots of local tips that made our stay better and his home was perfect for our family of four.
4387067,35357714,2015-06-17,1936665,Alice,Jeff and Mike were great--incredibly professional responsive and accommodating.  Despite my flight being delayed by six hours and my getting in at 4 in the morning they made sure that I was checked in and responded to all of my updates regarding the continued flight delays.  I really appreciated their hospitality on such short notice.  And when I arrived the room was immaculate just as beautiful as it looked on the website; and Jeff was a thoughtful host even leaving a white noise machine in the room to block out noise so that I could sleep better. The bathroom was just gorgeous as well. Overall a wonderful if short stay after a tiring flight. 
4909117,71857191,2016-04-29,39862279,Roger,The room was exactly was I was expected. Check in and out was very smooth and easy. The location is great for walking around any meeting in downtown or just for getting to know financial district or Union Square; very convenience location. 
12041223,159343724,2017-06-10,64709448,Taniya,Great room and bathroom! Private and clean. Cute patio just outside the room. Perfect for a weekend trip! 
20654216,275257969,2018-06-10,81860471,Chris,"John's place is a great place to stay while in SF.  The location is excellent just around the corner from Dolores Park and ony a couple blocks away from the best bakery in San Francisco Tartine Bakery.  
John was very quick to communicate sent excellent instructions for getting checked in and keeps a very clean place.  I would recommend John's place to anyone who is looking for a clean spacious and very affordable place to stay in the city."
1728497,365871393,2019-01-01,209003632,Nikolaj,Great home but infected with mice.
5884735,518557896,2019-08-26,13848723,Michael,Mouwafac's apartment was in a good location near public transportation so we could easily explore the city. Close to the apartement is also a beatiful park that Mouwafac told us to visit. We really enjoyed our stay in San Francisco.
7217193,402515353,2019-01-18,1662023,Andrew,Fantastically located space right in the heart of the Mission. Stephanie was responsive and provided many local tips. The kitchen was well equipped - although there’s no range/job. I’d stay again.
7343245,172753283,2017-07-21,40950608,David,A great location and a beautiful house with lots of space and very well equipped.
15785104,126531365,2017-01-12,5074720,Kimberly,Laurence's place was absolutely beautiful - you can tell that he's put a lot of love into it. Since we were there for business we didn't get to check out the neighborhood much but we were glad to have a nice quiet place to come back to each night. When we arrived Laurence gave us a very thorough tour of his home so we knew where to find everything and how to operate all of the high tech features. You can tell he's thought of every detail to make your stay as comfortable as possible. One huge plus about the place is that not only is it quiet but if you're looking for two private rooms this is perfect. The second room is outside and downstairs with it's own bathroom. It was wonderful for our needs and not a visit we'll soon forget.
13149975,127480623,2017-01-18,108914771,Erica,My brother who lives in San Francisco is now sad that he doesn't live in this apartment. Very clean and convenient. I only wish we had stayed longer. 
6430646,35004822,2015-06-14,27969473,David,My wife and I stayed at David's wonderful house for two nights in June. The room is true to the description and I can't imagine a better option for us. The private entrance was super convenient there was plenty of parking on his street. The location made it easy for us to walk down to Zazie for breakfast and enjoy some of the other coffee shops and resteraunts nearby. Such a great location: safe clean quiet and convenient . The room was super clean the bathroom and shower luxurious and the bed was very comfortable. David left us some snacks and flavored sparkling water which we really appreciated after our travels and late night walkabouts. David was very accommodating he made sure we were comfortable and we felt very welcomed. I would recommend him to any of my family or friends. We would also very much like to stay there again.
308885,49628409,2015-10-05,752054,Angie,I booked Arbe's place for an international coworker for about a week's stay. He had nothing but positive things to say about Arbe's place and her overall helpfulness. Everything went smoothly without issues. Will definitely be booking this place again in the future!
15010218,430469427,2019-03-30,17053177,Mauro,Rob’s place was very comfortable and a nice neighborhood. He was very attentive of anything I needed and the place has everything you need to feel at home. The house is walking distance to coffee shops laundry mats bars and anything you need. Also he has two big dogs that are very sweet they come and greet you every time and they’re very well behaved. Over all I had a very nice time here I would definitely recommend. Thank you Rob!
24890095,435206960,2019-04-09,18612193,Kyla,Quick response very clean and good value.
3312490,21283687,2014-10-14,19873467,Meghan,We didn't get to meet Maria but her friendly husband welcomed us and graciously showed us around the apartment despite the fact that we showed up a bit before check-in time. The apartment was spotless quiet and well appointed with clean linens and a welcome basket of snacks. We were happy to find a small coffee maker in the kitchen as well! The apartment is a bit removed from most of the city's hustle and bustle but we could easily get anywhere we needed to go using Uber and the nearby Muni bus/train stops. There are plenty of businesses within a couple blocks including many Asian restaurants some coffee shops/delis a grocery store and a Walgreens. It's the perfect quiet neighborhood to retreat to after a busy day in the city!
1069167,98067608,2016-08-29,19141648,Natasha,My 8 yr old son and I stayed here for 2 nights so we could see San Francisco before traveling on to Sequoia NP. Great place. Room was fun funky but in a comfortable grownup kind of way. Easy to get downtown on muni. Neighborhood was a little gritty but we had no problems. Best shower ever. Nice people great kitchen sweet dog...what more could we ask for?
8324569,103853110,2016-09-24,27150005,Tom,Carl's hospitality and engaging conversation helped make our three-night stay relaxing and enjoyable. He welcomed us ahead of time by emailing his own lengthy visitor's guide full of directions information about public transportation and other ways to get around and an exhaustive list of nearby cafes and restaurants with his personal recommendations. Our room was small but comfortable with a private bedroom (and robes waiting for us there) down the hall. The adjoining room has a bath en suite fyi. We ducked out the fire-escape window to sit on the back deck and in the back yard which includes a hot tub we were welcome to use but never had the chance to. Carl goes out of his way to make guests feel at home. Numerous varieties of coffee and tea as much as you want are available. Some nights he puts out wine that guests are welcome to enjoy. We appreciated the quiet location off Haight the organic grocery and wine shop across the street and the dedicated parking spot in the garage. We would definitely stay with Carl again. 
9051149,246981173,2018-03-26,2991946,Gian Michael,Elmer was great and his dog is super cute.  Good location and comfy bed. I enjoyed my stay!

11241173,415442530,2019-02-22,7672889,Arianne,Very clean space with good amenities. It was a very easy stay.
20803354,560750500,2019-11-07,53465879,Bruce,Perfect stay at a nice house in the middle of one of the most interesting neighbourhoods. The room was very comfy and fully equipped with snacks drinks toiletries and more! Great hospitality. I’d certainly stay here if I ever return to SF.
8336228,216794627,2017-12-05,34697178,Mitch,This is a very clean efficient space. It's a 15 minute walk to the Bart. It's a bit off the beaten path but close to the airport. The beds are comfortable. Matt and Anastasia are available for requests. Highly recommended.
1919372,151973326,2017-05-14,107131308,Jennifer,The location was EVERYTHING we wanted. The space itself is very well kept and perfect for two people. I would stay here again in a heartbeat !
15834994,305113782,2018-08-10,47789420,Evan,Everything about Nathan’s place is great! The views are amazing the street is quiet and it’s close to really good restaurants. I would highly recommend staying here

21252479,337293938,2018-10-15,214494328,Howard,Thank you Kirill for providing a clean hypoallergenic space that allowed me to recover from the allergic impact on me of the pet allergens on the planes. I especially appreciated the hardwood floors (and zero carpet).
22532009,543901285,2019-10-08,180419609,Loewe,Ein super gelegenes kleines Appartement mit zwei Schlafzimmern einem Wohnraum mit Küche und Terrasse. Ideal für Ausflüge in die Stadt.
1104362,12849380,2014-05-12,446713,Justin,"This studio space truly is located in the heart of Castro and served as a perfect landing spot for us while we had a long weekend in SF. You can bus or walk just about anywhere in the city. It's very clean cozy and comfortable. The door code entrance to the garden and the studio made going to and from very easy. 

Jan left us great touches like a few beers and iced coffee in the mini fridge which was a big bonus as we first arrived and unpacked not needing to head out right away for refreshments. I met one neighbor who shared the garden and he was very nice. Other than that it felt very private which we loved since we were celebrating our anniversary. 

We'd recommend this to anyone who wanted a conveniently located stay in SF. We have several friends who live in SF and each of them when they met us over our stay commented on what a great neighborhood/street we were on. "
12725886,193737142,2017-09-14,113226471,Chris,The private room here in Debbie's home was a very spacious and comfortable place to relax. Your own patio view deck a desk most importantly a very comfortable bed. Gave us good dinner recommendations. Near plenty of restaurants but also on a quiet street. Plus walking distance to the nature filled golden gate park! A must stay location if you are in the San Francisco area!!
13866653,320395260,2018-09-08,177324085,Laura,A wonderful place! The parking can be confusing with all of the little driveways but there is a lot of free space nearby. It is a gorgeous area and a fabulous stay.
23860519,531989844,2019-09-18,268806200,Keith,June’s place was very modern and clean!  We had everything we needed and more.  We we not able to park in front of the apartment during our time there and had a hard time finding street parking but June offered a solution that we very much appreciated.  The area was safe and quiet and the bed was comfy!  June will respond very quickly to any questions.  Great place!
15484215,254066830,2018-04-15,163188395,Jacqueline,Kayla’s place is perfect. All of the beds are comfortable. The space is spacious and clean. My entire group (6 people) loved the decor and the beautiful plants. You can tell the host is thoughtful based on all the touches in the home. Such as a huge selection of bathroom amenities and notes on how to operate appliances. The location is in such a wonderful safe area of the Castro. We walked and took ride-shares everywhere and left our car parked on the street all weekend with no problems. Kayla was quick to respond to all communication. We look forward to staying there again in the future.
3433930,126814308,2017-01-14,646450,Nimish & Nikhaar,"Paul & Tom are great hosts! 
I could not get much time to spend with them but they  graciously invited me for wine and chat session at their home. 
Their home was suited perfectly for me needs and Paul made sure that I felt comfortable and welcome as soon as my reservation was booked. 
The bathroom is huge and very clean and so is the room. Very tastefully done up! 
Their home is in a great neighborhood and the view from the room was one of the best I've seen in SF!
Highly recommended and I'd love to be back here. 
Thanks Paul & Tom for hosting me! "
3506164,231525493,2018-02-01,12339330,Neil,First class accommodation. The location was perfect for my work trip and central to my local friends. The apartment is spotless with a wonderful shower and very comfortable bed. Check in was easy the hosts easy to contact and quick to respond. A perfect place for my stay.
87640,15825823,2014-07-16,16026181,Jiju,Karin's house is like a my home. She is very kindful and great host. The house is very easy to access anywhere especially airport.  The room and bath is clean and have everything we needed. Noe valley is very silent and clean that has many pretty houses. I would stay Karin's house when we visit SFO again.
2316478,54749788,2015-11-23,32517623,Marty,The beach cottage was fantastic. It was everything we thought it would be and better. From the time we requested your place to the time we left all communications and transactions were done quickly and professionally. We will definitely be coming back. Thank you Angeline.
4654218,202065037,2017-10-09,18399490,Stephen,While I’m certain travelers are presented with many option when looking for a place to call it a day in San Fran they’d be remiss not to stay with Jack as his accommodations friendliness helpfulness and careful attention to his guests needs make him the quintessential host. My stay was without a single worry and fully freed me to relax and enjoy my time in and around the bay. See for yourself! 
150848,237114123,2018-02-21,52284441,Nicolle,"Nancy has thought of everything ! Her home is wonderful and she ensures you quickly feel comfortable in the space. The thoughtful touches mean you have almost all the information you need about the house neighbourhood and City as soon as you arrive. The breakfast Nancy made for us was delicious and chatting to Nancy was a treat too. This was our first ""shared"" air BnB we usually get a private space and It was amazing ! we felt comfortable and enjoyed the space. I would absolutely recommend Nancy's home to anyone :)"
7067681,218595746,2017-12-13,55720128,Chad,Sarah’s place was easy to find.  I checked in extremely late but the staff understood and were very friendly.  It provided everything you needed and wanted.
5154227,34054707,2015-06-04,28742766,Tela,The host made us feel welcome immediately.  There were brief introductions and then we were left to enjoy their home.  There was enough room for all of us.  House is located by the Zoo and a quick bus ride to Golden Gate Bridge.  The parking was ample.  There was only one issue with a few of the rooms not being as clean as expected.  There was a moldy smell on the sheets in 1 room and after a personal scrub and wash there was excessive dust/dog hair.  The mattress had a brown stain that was found during sheet change.  Also milk in fridge with 2013 expiration date...not sure why that was still there.  One of the extra comforters in the closet was torn.  So we were out of 1 bedroom because our guest didn't want to sleep in there after seeing this.  Area rugs could use a good wash or update as they were a bit dirty.  Were not total clean freaks but didn't like noticing these little quirks.  Minus these issues the stay was good and we couldn't beat the location/size.    
20654216,303618147,2018-08-07,27194707,Bastian,John is very kind and the communication was great. The location of the flat is perfect (Next to Dolores park). The room is beautifully furnished and especially the bed is extremely comfortable. I would recommend this flat to everyone who wants to experience some great days in SF.  
1206233,243949678,2018-03-17,34064296,Steven,Great location! Great communication! Easy check in and check out process. Even gave me an iphone charger to use when I forgot mine. Would recommend anybody that needs a place to sleep and freshen up for a good value in San Francisco.
24354551,315014577,2018-08-27,59056710,Nichole,Roam is INCREDIBLE. It's a concept unmatched in the Airbnb world. They take co-living/collaboration to a whole new level. The spaces are beautifully designed intentional creative and clean. The rooms were welcoming and bright. The kitchen was fully equipped and available for use. There are shared spaces and private spaces. Excellent Wifi. Great hosts. Comfortable amenities. I highly recommend staying at Roam SF and any of their other locations. It will be a destination for us in the future.

17424816,166868550,2017-07-04,9766162,Simon,We stayed at Carl's at the end of a two and a half week trip round California for three nights in San Francisco. Carl and Claire were really welcoming and helpful with recommendations about the area - which is great for restaurants and bars and has a nice neighbourhood feel. The room is a good size decorated beautifully and is light and airy. It is on the road but unless you're particularly sensitive to noise you should be fine we both slept really well all three nights. Would definitely recommend for a short stay in a fun part of town. Thanks again guys. Simon
713877,100724172,2016-09-10,8576533,Sheridan,We were a family of five including 3 teenage boys. Bearing in mind that space is at a premium in San Francisco whilst it was cosy it was perfect for our family. It truly is a charming space and a lovely bathroom. Enough room for the five of us to move around and have some quiet time at the end of a busy day. The beds were comfy the day bed overlooking the city is divine and the outside area also with views to the city was well used by us.  The Muni was only two blocks away and easy to get into the city. Cole Valley is a lovely neighbourhood that had everything we needed for our very first stop in the US from Australia. It was fun to walk down Haight Street which is only minutes away too.  Stacey was the perfect host very knowledgeable about all things local and very helpful.  
2020393,96422958,2016-08-22,25203978,Alexandra,This was a fantastic place. I felt like I was staying in a very cool museum. The space was huge and offered everything I was looking for. It's a couple of streets away from a busier part of town and was a little bit noisy at night but overall very pleasant. The beds weren't extremely comfortable; however that would be my only real complaint. Overall this is a wonderful option for San Francisco. 
28128935,472499654,2019-06-19,17368921,Valentina,we really enjoyed our stay at Paula's apartment. very spacious equipped with all comforts.

3333870,73287241,2016-05-08,20609833,Titia,Nancy's place is just perfect. She waited up for me (I was a late arrival) and was communicative but not intrusive. Cole Valley is a wonderful neighborhood. Quiet streets fragrant with flowers and shrubs. The apartment is walking distance from cafes restaurants and public transportation. The room is very comfortable and includes a roomy updated bathroom. I look forward to my next stay here.

1767543,156484062,2017-05-30,41767952,Margarita,Russ place was very clean. It could be a bit small for 5 people. The entry to the cottage is kind of difficult and uncomfortable if you have big suitcases. The beds and bathrooms were comfortable and clean. 
1177310,19955316,2014-09-21,9371323,Matthew,Highly recommended! The apartment was great loved the kitchen and backyard! The neighborhood is fantastic very family-friendly. The apartment is walking distance from dozens of restaurants and cafes. We would definitely stay there again!

1995487,23424597,2014-12-01,18016293,Lesley,Serendipity brought us to San Francisco Mission Mission Loft and last but not least our unforgettable host Michael. We endorse all of the positive comments that have been offered already about Mission Loft: great location beautiful space thoughtful attention to detail. We were looking for a more personal experience than a hotel would give and for us Michael's generosity of spirit and genuine interest in us as guests has made our stay a delight. Heartfelt thanks to Michael and a robust recommendation for the Loft.

1886260,38872994,2015-07-19,28518356,Antoine,Un séjour très agréable à San Francisco. Nous avons deux enfants et l'appartement était assez vaste pour tout le monde avec une salle de bains à remous. Il est assez facile également de se garer' aux alentours.
6015077,169740660,2017-07-13,58343992,Thomas,"Dieses Haus ist eine tolle Möglichkeit San Francisco zu erleben. Mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln ist man in ca 45 Minuten am Pier 39. Auch mit dem Auto kommt man schnell voran. Am Abend entkommt man dem Trubel der Stadt etwas und kann das Meer genießen. Un der Wohnung finden 6 Personen bequem Platz. Küche und Wohnzimmer sind perfekt ausgestattet. Wir würden duese Wihnung jederzeit wieder nutzen.

2026910,10790704,2014-03-07,69274,Kirk,"I can't say enough great things about this place and how much my parents enjoyed their stay. From what I saw it seemed nicer then my house! Great pops of color in certain places that seem like a hotel.

My parents went on and on about how much they loved it. They said things like: 

>>The kitchen must be brand new? 
>>You should get your floors redone as the floors at our place are so nice and shiny.
>> They loved the view (towards the haight and St. Francis Woods?)
>> They slept better then they usual do at mattress. Some sort of special sheets?

I could go on and on... YES they loved it. YES they didn't want to leave. YES your place is nicer and more comfortable than ours. "
5577516,267778609,2018-05-22,51175625,Suresh,"The place is quiet. Good and safe neighborhood. 
The beds are creaky.... and shake a lot. Bathroom accessories are inadequate. WiFi is poor. TV comes on and off...poor connectivity. No cable connection. Host not very approachable. Customer service is delayed and poor. Overall poor value for money."
224579,413614718,2019-02-17,27428444,Joanna,We had a lovely time staying in Armelle's home. It was clean well-furnished and very comfortable. The location was good and the price was even better. Armelle was an extremely kind and very responsive host—all instructions were clear and our check-in and check-out was a cinch. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to any visitor.
19721174,318531467,2018-09-03,1602172,Talia,"The location is unbeatable - walk bike public transport in every direction. The apartment is clean and cared for and the attention to all the little details that make you feel ""at home"" knows no limits. Virginia and Marshall were responsive helpful and kind. And yup the bathroom could very well be called a personal spa and should have its own review page."
3486460,40956827,2015-08-03,16279162,Bianca,The place was exactly as pictured - clean spacious and inviting. Emily and her boyfriend were great hosts and very hospitable. The neighbourhood is picturesque and within walking distance (for those who enjoy the exercise) to many iconic places around the city. Thank you for the lovely stay we enjoyed it! :)
5852066,238964460,2018-02-27,47224345,Jay,Very clean we'll appointed great part of town nice view lots of sunshine through the windows. You have to go to The Mill down the hill around the corner for great coffee and delicious sourdough. Easy walk to civic center and the heart of the Mission district. As it turns out on this trip we never crossed paths with Paul so I can only say how much we appreciated him entrusting us to stay at his place.
2686530,78638001,2016-06-08,23492913,Shih-Yu,"Jeana was an amazing and considerate host. She makes sure you are very comfortable and welcoming at her place. The location could not be better since there are some many eateries and shops near by. Also the main public transportation system is near by as well. The Dolores park is only 10 minutes walking from this place which makes it even better. The room is exactly as described but even better given of the location. I would highly recommend her place to anyone who is visiting San Francisco.
I would like to also mention that she was very gracious enough to accommodate my needs of a place to stay at the last very last minute since my previous host cancelled on me the night before I was leaving for San Francisco. Can not say enough nice things about her and her place.

28387261,565680555,2019-11-17,8597236,Justin,Nancy’s place was nice and cozy and in a perfect location. She was also very friendly and responsive to my questions. The room faces the street but you can hardly hear any noise outside. I would certainly stay here again.
6117147,526317778,2019-09-08,212227861,Sheila,A cozy and relaxing place to stay with a lovely private garden.  The little touches such as chocolates and dressing gowns made all the difference.

3309722,209204901,2017-11-04,27439282,Elizabeth,Very close to public transit grocery stores and cafes. Nice and quiet area. The apartment has great views of the city and all the necessities you could think of. If you're interested in quiet and relaxing this is the place to stay. No crazy parties or loud bars to keep you up at night. Cliff and Colleen are available by text whenever you need anything but don't hover or try to micromanage you. We had a great time staying there!
727866,454674243,2019-05-18,248719524,Shannon,This is a clean and comfortable space within only a few blocks of the ocean beach! I couldn't have asked for a more optimal location for my first trip to San Francisco.
35291911,471604781,2019-06-17,24706882,John,I had a great stay at Tami's apartment in the Mission with my family (spouse and young daughter).  The unit is in a great location -- it's on a quiet residential street and still only steps away from restaurants parks and all the exciting places that the neighborhood has to offer.  The apartment is larger than it looks thoughtfully appointed and in pristine condition.  Tami was an amazing host -- she was responsive and engaged and it was clear to us that she cared a lot for her guests and her space.  I would highly recommend staying here or at any of Tami's places.  Thanks for a great trip!
1931459,9230390,2013-12-15,8692262,Lowell,Blair was a terrific responsive host. Her condo was immaculate stylish bright and quiet.  Every inch of the place exuded warmth and comfort.  Blair provided the ultimate experience and should be the poster child for (Website hidden by Airbnb) I just hope that her place is available the next time I'm in San Francisco!
631635,416996534,2019-02-25,11427349,Anarosa,Beautiful apartment wonderfully located. We had fun walking up and down the hills to the Castro and the Mission getting great coffee and eating delicious food. The apartment has some great quirky touches which gives it a unique feel. Check-in was a breeze. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Betty!
499096,4592381,2013-05-14,1318617,Matthew,The flat is secluded and very quiet.  There are heaters to keep you warm.  The hot water works and fast.  A good amount of room for myself in a great location.  The steepness of the hill is not really a problem didn't even think about it after the first day. Ingrid was kind to me.
3112427,295990671,2018-07-24,41082577,Kristen,We enjoyed our stay here very much. Extremely clean and inviting space with a little bit of everything for us to use. It's also located close to public transportation so it's easy to get downtown without having to lyft or uber all the time. 
13605661,314437468,2018-08-26,58240034,Lauren,Arts place is all good! It is very private and a decent sized room (with the sofa etc). We only really used the room as a base we were out all day but it had everything we needed and nice touches such as biscuits and cutlery etc :). The only problem for us was that the parking was a bit of a nightmare! It was better on the weekend though and Art was very helpful advising us on this situation. 
6331695,65590155,2016-03-15,10462731,Ken,This is a great place to live in the heart of San Francisco. The house is absolutely gorgeous. The comfy beds are amazing.

14996188,216964732,2017-12-06,81020516,Hannah,"Suzanne’s place was perfect. The pictures don’t even do it justice. Everything was spotless and it felt as though we were the first ones to stay in their retreat. She has binders full of recommendations for the best food and activities in the area and was quick to respond to any questions we had.

We unfortunately had to leave early due to the fires in LA that were approaching our home and Suzanne and her husband were VERY understanding and helpful. No words can express how thankful we are for their generosity and we will definitely be back!"

11464408,80330106,2016-06-17,11815110,Jürgen,"Ulysses was a great host - fast and reliable responses great guidance to get into the studio very warm and welcoming. The location is exactly as described and very close to Bart (7min walking) and 280 which makes it easy to commute into the city or down into the Valley. 
Would definitely book again!"
14268636,479287241,2019-06-30,15309799,Daniel,Julian was an amazing host and I 100% would go back. He has a great place with great snacks in a great location. He is always on top of any doubt you may have and will help you to the best of his abilities. If you are lucky enough to find his place available book it immediately!
10787034,483522499,2019-07-07,257272384,Kamran,This is a wonderful location near the Glen Park BART. Everything was fantastic. Leslie is nice to talk to. The only complaint is that the noise level can be quite a lot. If noise is a thing for you I would recommend a quieter place. Otherwise great!
9532943,61297107,2016-02-02,21699462,Jorge,Great location! Walking distance from anything worth walking to. The room was nice and clean very cozy. Perfect looking forward to coming back. 
7026287,74198824,2016-05-14,67506933,Kendrick,Talk about setting the bar for high standards! Across the board every aspect of my stay was perfect and I truly can't think of any way that it could have been better. The manual and materials provided perfectly described the location and how to enter. The room was immaculate and on par with some of the best hotels I've stayed anywhere in the world. The attention to detail for every aspect of the place was amazing. My only regret was that my business kept me outside of the room and the neighborhood so I wasn't able to fully explore and appreciate everything.
392543,436737407,2019-04-13,2893774,James,The space is clean and comfortable great dining all around the area and an absolutely wonderful private garden really make this place a gem. Combine that with wonderful hosts and an even cuter puppy it’s hard to go wrong with this spot.
937842,7477512,2013-09-22,5780277,Merlin,what a great stay we had! it was 6 of us. me my partner and his family. Communication between Amadis and Martha was flawless. They where very prompt to answer and guide us with the question. Getting in to the house was easy and with out no problems.  House had 2 big bedrooms and one smaller bed room but still enough space for the couple.House was clean an cosy with the amazing wooden floors. the bathroom was clean and big. in the kitchen you have all the cooking faciliities if you wish to sat in and cook! Even though the house was close to the road the sound never bothered us. House was in a good distance from all the main attractions. We where driving a car and in few minutes we where in wishermans or in golden gate bridge! It could be maybe a bit travelling if you go with the public transport but I am sure it will be amazing way of exploring the Mission. Starbucks and other coffee shops are just few min walking from the house. Parking was easy we did not have any  problems of finding the space. Maybe worth to mention ( this is not complain as we enjoyed 100 %)  is in the 3rd bedroom there are 2 single beds :) witch you wont be able to push together as me and my partner where thinking to do! in spite of that we still slept cosily to each other arms :):) and it did not bothered us at all. it is brilliant if you have family travelling with the children. So i would recommend the house to everybody friends travelling together singles and family's!  Thank you Amadis and Marth
19922726,210494376,2017-11-09,94969537,Jason,The location is great and the host is fantastic.  The space is very modern touch lighting speaker system throughout Amazon Alexa is in the guest rooms.  Very comfortable very clean very hospitable.  Plan to stay here again if it’s available.
859336,36650842,2015-06-30,26686323,Colette,"All was perfect in Anka's house: first it is very well located in the Castro and many bus stations are around.
Secondly the flat is absolutely charming clean lightly and cumfortable and all the equipments can be easely used (in the kitchen for cooking the living room for having a rest the dining room...).
The room is very wellcoming too!
All is well organized to get the key to discover her house and Anka has made a ""homebook"" where she gives many advices  about restaurants bars or shops.
She is always easely reached by phone or by mail and she was helpful when wa had questions about the city.
we stayed here during 4 nights and we really felt at home.
Great experience!"
207980,149317470,2017-05-03,86986800,Andy,Nice cosy home about a half hour drive from the city and fishermans wharf which was fine as we had a car. Good value for money with all the basics you need for a comfortable stay.

208831,25464726,2015-01-17,12373259,Wani,Peter was very accommodating and his place is the perfect location to be in for San Francisco. Very near to fishermans wharf chinatown little Italy crooked street etc. we enjoyed walking everywhere and for places that are further we would either uber or lyft. As far as the place itself lots of space! Very clean and cozy. Highly recommend Peter and his place. Thanks for a great time! 
6074750,491083609,2019-07-19,13401160,Sandro,Really loved the area and the local vibe. The room was very functional and clean the bed was also extremely comfortable. Over the weekend the adjacent apartment (different owners) got noisy but the host took care of it the next morning which we appreciated.
16335125,319949733,2018-09-07,55116073,Kim,Fully equipped apartment and so easy to check in! It was a wonderful stay we had everything we needed and more!

30816842,438461240,2019-04-16,59020580,Shubham,It was a great experience staying with Pankaj and Sarah. I met the host Pankaj who lives in a room upstairs from mine. He is a very humble and nice person. Looking forward to stay again.

9435665,107472994,2016-10-10,37523437,Aim,House is in good neighborhood. Beautiful. Have all necessities.  Dog's hair everywhere though made me question the cleanliness a little. We did not get to talk to them at all i was ok with that but if u want to mingle get local tips etc not sure u will get it. 
8290464,210481855,2017-11-09,51086986,Michael,Very comfortable and quiet!  Perfect spot for staying in the city but just outside of all the hustle and bustle.  Great local shops and restaurants easy access to the city via Uber/Lyft.  On top of all of that Kim provides many personal touches that makes it feel like your home away from home.  Highly recommended and I would definitely stay there again.

496226,49601508,2015-10-05,38448467,Sami,Pam and Albie were really quick to respond to all of our questions and very helpful. The flat was as described clean comfortable nice to have a few household things around (milk tea shampoo etc!) They let us check out an few hours late which was much appreciated as we had a late flight. Flat is about 30 minute walk to downtown or there are buses. Near mission district which is great for bars and restaurants. The only thing was that the walls & ceilings are thin so you can hear every footstep and doors opening / closing which wasnt overly disturbing but quite loud. Would recommend the apartment to young couples. Thanks P & A!
14990478,125040500,2017-01-03,108608085,Peter,Amazing. Super cute place it felt like home. Eddie was really kind and went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable. It was the best AirBnB experience I've had in a long time!
18012893,176385420,2017-07-30,133793035,David,This place in the Outer Sunset is perfectly appointed for a solo traveler looking to explore a different part of the City. It is near several Muni bus and train stops and steps away from Golden Gate Park. Though situated along a relatively busy street the unit is quiet. I would stay here again if looking to be in the neighborhood.
21693492,267416627,2018-05-21,137686534,Vinay,Great place!
22396902,368969010,2019-01-08,107384003,Ekaterina,Good room lots of stairs so be prepared if you have heavy luggage! But otherwise great location and welcoming hosts.
27107519,506531700,2019-08-10,22492253,Philippe,"Patty and Rob are the perfect hosts and the cabana with its Jacuzzi just in front of Dolores’park is the best place to be in San Francisco. 
Perfect place very easy to walk around in different neighbourhoods.
Very charming apartment."

14268636,171098796,2017-07-16,47675593,Peter,"Vi boede to voksne og to store børn hos Julian i 6 dage under vores ophold i SF. Vi boede i ""Garden Room"" som er hans vel største værelse. Julian er en helt fantastisk vært. Helt vildt service minded og hjælpsom. Virkelig! Ved ankomsten fik vi papirer han havde skrevet med gode råd til hvordan man kommer rundt internet 4G osv osv. Da vi skulle rejse hjalp han os med at lægge videre rejseplaner. Faktisk har jeg sjældent oplevet så hjælpsom et menneske. Og det kom fra hjertet!

Det ligger i et fattigt men roligt område Syd for centrum. Man kan tage en Uber til centrum for 10-15 $. Somme tider tog Vi også metroen (BART) som ligger 15 min gang derfra. 

Selve værelset var meget fint med IKEA møbler og helt rent. Også sengetøjet var helt rent. Han lejer også et par andre værelser ud så det var lidt ligesom et hostel hvor man deltes om køkken og badeværelse. Dog havde vi vores eget toilet udenfor vores værelse. Det er mægtig hyggeligt og giver mulighed for at tale med de andre beboere få få gode råd osv. Men det gør naturligvis også at man deler køkkenet med de andre. Der var en smule nusset i køkkenet det var ikke pinlig rent men ikke noget man ikke kan leve med. Sådan lidt ligesom et kollegium. 
Noget særligt var at der var gratis adgang til et rum med en sand velsignelse af snacks slik vand cola osv. Det elskede børnene.

8221207,226837109,2018-01-12,1624499,Catherine,"This place was the perfect place to relax. It almost felt like I was staying at The Kabuki Hotel without all the additional foot traffic. 

Tietjen was responsive and helpful and would highly recommend her beautiful space."
2178509,10272381,2014-02-10,1550755,Daniel,Gregg has a gorgeous house that is beautifully decorated perfectly clean and very comfortable.  The guest room is near the entrance so I never felt like I was disturbing him when I would come home late at night.  This is really a wonderful place at a great value and I'd be happy to stay there again!
3727061,83244893,2016-07-02,18409430,Daniel,Tim's place was in a great location with great amenities. Booked last minute for my family of 6 and we all fit very well and had more than enough space. Tim was very accommodating of some of our requests as well and very clear on instructions. Overall an amazing stay!
8274904,348169145,2018-11-12,120021785,Stephanie,A great location! Perfect place to get to many spots in the city. Saundra is a great host and does a good job of giving local tips and suggestions. Two nice cats in the house too.
19236730,325464992,2018-09-19,10570710,Drew,Fantastic location. Great bed. Spacious room with hotel amenities.
36519291,561649960,2019-11-09,133581443,Kaitlin,Eza’s apartment is exactly how it looks in the pictures. Clean tastefully decorated and cozy. Close to downtown SF but far enough away for some peace and quiet. The only issue we had was the tv signal was weak and many of the channels had static and were fuzzy. We did not spend much time watching tv just at night before bed so not a big deal. Other than that we had a great stay.
1807493,49446160,2015-10-04,12686181,Nicolas,Nous avons été déçu de ce séjour à San Francisco. L'appartement est sympa mais le quartier n'inspire pas confiance. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Tom mais il a été très disponible pour faciliter notre séjour. L'appartement est petit pour 3 mais parfait pour 2 personnes

9258941,82152849,2016-06-26,65671533,Jeongmin,모스콘 센터에서 있는 학회 참석을 위해 숙소를 구하던 중 Ian의 숙소를 알게되었습니다. 4명이서 private한 방을 사용할 수 있어서 좋았어요. 특히 넓은 거실과 모든것이 잘 구비된 키친 그리고 세탁기 건조기 등 생활하는데 있어 불편함이 전혀 없었네요! 모스콘 센터가 있는 다운타운으로 가는 직행 버스가 바로 집 앞에 있어 교통편도 아주 좋았구요! 다만 버스가 자주 없다는 점과 관광객이 거의 없어 밤에는 약간 무서울 수 있다는 점 참고해주세요^^
12905538,344114405,2018-11-02,47584081,Maaret,Location was nice an quiet a little distant from center but with easy access with public transportation to city.   Place had excellent bedding  attention to safety and basics were provided  we enjoyed our stay including nice MArimekko touches would recommend to my friends in the future.
17794706,142320995,2017-04-07,70595788,Paul,The Herbert was a good stay and I would recommend it as a cheap alternative to hotels in San Francisco.
17159806,148438794,2017-04-30,125234739,Sakura,Terry was great ! Me and my girlfriends had such a great stay and the house was perfect ! Not too bad to uber around from that location ! 
256176,321124139,2018-09-09,56658831,Vee,Eva provided a warm welcome with specialized notes to our stay. Thank you so much for making a stay in SF feel so local and friendly.

4695477,102107517,2016-09-16,73082978,Meri,We really enjoyed staying at Maria´s cottage. It´s really cute clean and confortable . It´s located in the backyard of Maria´s beautiful house in a nice and well located neighbourhood. It brings a lot of privacy and María takes care to provide every accesory you may need (coffee fridge soap iron...). She seems to have a deep attention to details and she is very responsive to any need or question you may have.  I fully recommend this place! Thanks Maria!
212783,270895629,2018-05-30,47358238,Ramkumar,Josh was quick to respond understanding and helpful. The apartment itself is furnished well and fully equipped. Good location that’s near to many attractions.

5852066,60054496,2016-01-18,6637026,Aaron,We had a great stay at Paul's place.  The room is exactly as advertised.  Bed is super comfortable and having the bathroom en-suite is a big plus.  Beautiful home in a central location.  Paul is very nice and gave us lots of tips/info/recommendations on both the neighborhood and SF in general.  Great airbnb experience.
20287325,271590320,2018-06-01,75399241,Jon William,Cozy simple room in a heartwarm building The Red Victorian. Highly recomended if you like living together in a shared community kind of feeling. Open and warm people <3
14501673,345285806,2018-11-04,10176129,Heather,Wonderful hosts great apartment. Best thing about it is that Carlos and Graciela were very available if I needed anything and very helpful at check-in. The best Air bnb experience I've had so far!
12026856,495936082,2019-07-26,57772465,Michelle,Our room was clean spacious and comfy for our 2 night stay in San Francisco. We were aware that we would be sharing with up to 3 other sets of travellers but as expected this lead to a bit of waiting for the shared bathroom and some noise. However Maria was a very helpful and kind host always offering suggestions for dinner around the local area. The house is a little further away from the tourist hot spots than expected but Uber’s were readily available.
1759087,9218891,2013-12-14,8799571,Austin,"Gerardo was an excellent host was extremely flexible with check in time was east to get in touch with and extremely prompt with replies.  He was also extremely accommodating and made sure that I had everything I needed to make my stay enjoyable.

The apartment itself was fantastic.  It's a simple but elegant room in the downstairs of his apartment with a very comfortable bed small fridge and breakfast table and a comfortable couch with a flatscreen TV.  The bathroom was beautiful and the ability to control the exact temperature of the water was a nice touch.  The room also has access to a small patio and nice sized yard with views of downtown which I unfortunately did not have a chance to take advantage of.

The neighborhood is fantastic - I lived up the block several years ago.  It's quiet but there are a number of excellent restaurants one block up the hill.  The area is safe and is especially convenient for anyone that has business at the UCSF Mission Bay site.  I'll absolutely be staying here again next time I have the opportunity to return to the city!"
10883329,128434594,2017-01-24,52802319,Rachel,"This is a motel and an outdated motel at that. The exterior is nice the common space was nice but the rooms were not nice at all. I would not stay here again. If they want to be successful as a ""hotel for startups"" then they will need much nicer rooms. "
1898486,11391594,2014-04-01,2158340,SueAnn,My husband and I stayed in Ed and Sunny's cottage for three months from January - March 2014.  It was a marvelous experience. The cottage is located in a prime location in Noe Valley with easy access to the other areas via public transport. The area is very residential and safe with a variety of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The 2-floor cottage is private. It is tucked away very quiet and includes a lovely private garden with furniture. You are removed from any street noise or activity. It is modern clean and fully stocked beyond what you would expect. Ed and Sunny thought of every detail to ensure guests have a comfortable experience. Ed was incredible responsive to any questions and really cared about our comfort. Everything we needed to live there for three months was provided for and more. Overall we consider Ed a friend and fully recommend the cottage to anyone visiting San Francisco.
31377697,450227771,2019-05-08,39240429,Wesley,5 star stay all around! Friendly hosts private room and entrance amazing shower. I worked from home and was very comfortable. Noe Valley itself is a quiet place. The Airbnb is a quick 5-10 minute walk to great coffee and food. I'll surely be back to Dana's place :)

The one comment I’ll make is that you are likely to hear kids running upstairs. It stopped at night though so it was no big deal. Stay away if you like to sleep in haha.  "
18765944,349214603,2018-11-16,126418332,Corey,By far one of the best AirBnb places we have stayed and the most gracious hosts as well. The accommodations were lovely and clean and the location is more convenient than we thought it would be (and that's without a car!).  If you're looking a place to stay in SF that has a personal touch can't recommend this place enough.
1393654,457284625,2019-05-23,263140654,Giovanni,Kevin è una persona squisita attenta a tutto dotata di un’impeccabile capacità di interagire con gli ospiti e di una singolare chiarezza nella spiegazione di tutte le regole e le caratteristiche della casa. Vive lì con la sua famiglia: lui sua moglie una bimba molto curiosa e simpatica a cui piace interagire con gli ospiti e una cagnetta intelligente ed educata. Da musicista ho trovato piacevole il soggiorno anche perché nella casa ci sono alcuni strumenti che possono essere utilizzati dagli ospiti (due chitarre un pianoforte). Prezzo impeccabile per San Francisco. Insomma non poteva andarci meglio!

The balcony with its view on San Francisco is amazing as well as the location. Very calm and relaxed neighborhood. Would always go there again when I’m back in San Francisco!
11674758,103649073,2016-09-23,15218611,Latha,"Pete and Ivan's apartment was great.  I was passing through San Francisco on a cycling trip so enjoyed heading out from their place and riding to the ballpark then around the Marina district to do some sightseeing.  

The apartment itself was very well maintained and very clean.  The bed was comfortable and there was plenty of space to unwind and relax.  The bathroom was also very clean the shower was (Website hidden by Airbnb) complaints whatsoever.  

I only met both Pete and Ivan very briefly but they were very welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed for my stay.  I would definitely recommend their place and would stay here again on another San Francisco trip."

29187120,456537042,2019-05-21,10232347,Cezar,Mary is an amazing human being. The house is extremely well located right by 280 exit there is plenty of parking available. For those who like cooking the kitchen is really good. Because the room faces the highway it can get a little loud but it's fine if you keep the windows closed.

24967604,306593664,2018-08-12,103882210,Noel,Evelyn is a great host! She was very communicative and a pleasure to coordinate with :) 
16219958,445044360,2019-04-28,14141600,Todd,Great place to visit San Fran. Igor and his wife really made their home feel warm.  Thank you for the awesome stay!
10385321,83409846,2016-07-02,3864228,Caroline,We really enjoyed our stay at Robert's place. If you're looking for a large clean and comfortable spot to stay during your visit to SF this is it! While it's located a bit outside of city center the apartment is very convenient to the metro and bus stations and much more affordable then what you'll find downtown. Robert was a fantastic host and very helpful when we had questions. The apartment came fully equipped with a clean bathroom very comfortable bed TV and couch. 
4365969,521310316,2019-08-31,121510842,Jessi,"We had the pleasure of meeting Leslie and her family and friends. They were all such welcoming beautiful people. We had an extra day with nothing planned and we got so many suggestions of things the locals like to do we made it through the list and fell in love with San Francisco in a way we wouldn’t of if we hadn’t met Leslie.
Leslie’s place was a little slice of heaven in a lovely area of busy San Francisco. It had everything you could ever need it was a specious room with beautiful french doors which lead to a lovely garden. We were really lucky with the weather so most days were sunny which meant we could open up the doors and sit out.
We couldn’t of asked for anything more from Leslie she was the perfect Airbnb host who takes pride in making sure her guests are comfortable and have everything they need.
It was a super easy check in we arrived earlier than check in time but Leslie was so helpful and allowed us to leave our bags at her home so we could start exploring San Fran. 
No matter what we needed Leslie and Richard were always on hand and we couldn’t thank them enough for an amazing stay.
If we ever make it back to San Francisco we will definitely be staying in Leslie’s place again."
44032,33770423,2015-06-01,13460616,Cherie,Such a wonderful experience. Its actually my second time visiting SF but it felt like the first-- it's a really short stay the first time and there's not a person giving us wonderful tips of where to go&what to see like David&Tina. David suggested me checking out the farmers market on Saturday and it turned out to be a BLAST. The room itself is so cute comfy and perfectly located: minutes to the bart station it is at the center of Mission area. Personally I think it's the best neighborhood to get the the true SF experience. So much fun. I just wish I could stay longer...highly recommend!
23044309,536015023,2019-09-25,16913243,Alex,With a perfect location in the Castro Noom's studio is an ideal central spot to stay where you get a lot of bang for your buck. Noom was an excellent host - easily accommodating an earlier check in time when I needed one and quick to respond throughout my stay. Highly recommended!!
3168359,329828235,2018-09-29,107456363,Stephan,Jamies apartment was exactly as described and perfectly located near Golden Gate Park and the Cliff House area. Next Geary bus station just 1 Minute walk away so that you can get easily to downtown within 30-40 minutes. Jamie was a very good host and answered our questions always on very short notice. We can definitely recommend Jamie’s place to San Francisco visitors.
30428843,407296484,2019-02-01,135296309,Perla,Their place and hospitality was amazing! We had many enjoyable conversations and they were able to recommend places where we could go. I LOVED the location. It was in a very safe neighborhood and S (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) many shops and restaurants right outside the front door! If you can book with them you definitely should!
16219958,265898462,2018-05-18,41714156,Leah,Decent location and Igor was kind but I was not under the impression that we would be sharing one bathroom with 8+ people (there are 3 rooms in total that are rented out at the same time) This is not the place to stay unless you’re cool with waiting one hour to use the bathroom. Also the walls are very thin and the neighbors staying next to us were very loud and disrespectful- yelling on the phone before 7am and left their dirty clothes/underwear/toiletries all over the bathroom although they were sharing with other guests. Not the experience for you if you enjoy any kind of quiet/privacy.
16972383,505742459,2019-08-09,110384223,Evelyn,This is overall a great place considering the value. The staff at this lodging was very accommodating and helpful.
87640,420456762,2019-03-06,68494640,David,Lovely place. Enchanting garden. Very private. Just far enough off the beaten path to give a little space from the city.  About a 20 min walk to BART if don’t mind a stroll.

746079,79007630,2016-06-10,16771173,Svenja,Ian's guest room is just great for having a few wonderful days in San Francisco. It's spaciousclean and comfy. Ian and TJ are great hosts. Highly recommended!
9258941,80751657,2016-06-19,13902418,Jackie,"The apartment is very spacious and comfortable and has a modern style (kitchen and bathrooms are updated) but still manages to preserve some of the quaint and original aspects of the home (e.g. fireplace in one room chandelier lighting decorative moldings on the ceilings hardwood floors etc.).

The Mission is an eclectic and interesting neighborhood.  If you're looking for a not-so-touristy area this is a good option.  Mission Dolores Park is a beautiful place to hang out (note it's about a mile away from the apartment) and there are many food options in the immediate area.  The only slightly negative thing is that while there are several public transportation options in the vicinity we opted for cab/Uber/Lyft rides to get around and it could get pricey since Mission is not exactly city center (though not far at all).

As a host Ian was very hospitable and flexible throughout the booking process.  On our second day there was a large fire that impacted quite a few buildings just a block or two away from the apartment and Ian's partner Naomi kindly called us to inform us so that we wouldn't be surprised when we got back home and found the street blocked off by cop cars and firetrucks.  After we checked out we realized we'd left a camera in the apartment and Ian and Naomi were kind enough to facilitate the process of us getting it back.

Overall it was a great experience that allowed our group of 7 to stay together while we enjoyed the beautiful city of San Francisco.  Thank you Ian and Naomi!"
12154878,121053036,2016-12-13,101982194,Kristen,I would recommend this place for someone who will not be staying there during the day.  It is right on the street so something to be aware of  but parking is doable nearby and it is a good location.
11775546,553662070,2019-10-24,8678228,Jay,The location was a resort/hotel that was well kept.  It was clean and modern and centrally located within San Francisco.  Booking and checking in was as easy as booking a hotel.
21766603,457281929,2019-05-23,25436496,Chris,"I really loved Hilary’s space. It’s nice to not be in a busy and noisy neighborhood but still close by to so much. The ocean beautiful cliff side parks and hiking trails to the GG Br only 5-10min walk away. And GG Park. 38R bus gets you to market street in ~30min. Great food nearby on Balboa. A safe neighborhood. 

I loved Hilary’s attention to detail. Every amenity I could need she stocked. Everything was clean and sparkling. Bed was super comfortable. She was so hospitable even bringing down a food bowl water cooler and bed for my dog to use. 

I would definitely stay here again."

1421774,325785654,2018-09-20,5333364,Michele,The studio is very nice well furnished and equipped with everything you could need for a comfortable stay. Vanick and Lindsay are at your disposal in case of any question. They also provide you with tea coffee a welcome kit and soaps for the shower. The studio is located 15 minutes by car from Union Square. Absolutely recommended!
10998250,102287259,2016-09-17,35236663,Alana,"Teo is a fantastic host very helpful and goes far beyond what is expected of an Air BnB host. He left us wine had water and coffee on offer and treated us as if we were friends who were guests in his house. He gave us a lift downtown and let us use his garage for our car for the day - even after our stay had ended.
The room is actually much nicer than in the pictures on the website and the location is extremely convenient for visiting San Francisco.
I would highly recommend staying with Teo."
6080799,363008492,2018-12-27,536873,Kimon,Charming beautifully appointed cozy zen paradise. Sara is an impeccable hostess. Feet from the ocean this was one of my most favorite AirBnB experiences.
2046634,60777085,2016-01-27,20645939,Nathalie,"Kenix was brilliant from the start and flexible with check in which was great for us. Thank you for helping us to park and advising us on the SF parking rules! 
We loved the location - it is an easy 30/40 min bus ride to downtown (along Mission so you see all the murals) so maybe a but far for some but it means you are in an area with amazing Mexican food! Go to Pissed Off Pete's (what a great name for a bar) for a pint and local banter. 
The room and bathroom were super clean. We had a lot of noise from other guests the first night but that wasn't Kenix fault and I'm only mentioning it in case they read this (shame on you!) . Overall a great stay and I definitely recommend staying here. "
856123,233459165,2018-02-09,118514838,Matt,A perfect balance of privacy and the welcoming comradely of a stay with friends.
33578,59647338,2016-01-13,51335463,Kate,I had a wonderful stay with Kepa in Potrero Hill: her home is beautiful the garden is something magical and the room was warm comfortable spotless and very pretty. She went out of her way to make me feel welcome throughout my stay and I learnt masses from Kepa about her city and life in her city. It was a very valuable and memorable experience. 
21280829,246086595,2018-03-24,6764611,Geoff,Where to begin... we loved this beautiful home in the sky.  It was extremely warm soft and cozy - and an Instagram worthy dream as advertised.  From sitting above the city reading on the private balcony to having everything in the city at easy access Jane's home (and her eclectic and immaculately curated book collection) made our otherwise work-filled business trip magnitudes better than we could have imagined.  Thank you Jane!
13021568,164772424,2017-06-29,71666031,Reece,"If you want to receive 5 star treatment this is the place for you! Peihong couldn't do enough for us she was extremely helpful and caring! She offered us everything from providing breakfast free access to kitchen and laundry facilities endless bottles of water ensuring the room was spotless and even offering us a beer on the odd occasion! She also gave us a helpful map of San Francisco and travel directions and information! 

In short if you are looking for a place to stay in San Francisco definitely put Peihongs place at the top of your list! "
9489347,154930593,2017-05-26,3515940,Andrea,Absolutely loved everything about this place. Extremely accommodating host beautiful interior central location near so many great areas cafes restaurants and parks. Can't recommend it enough!
29906769,505775616,2019-08-09,110235476,Aidan,Very clean convenient location good amenities and very knowledgeable and passionate host. Would definitely return.
862201,34056112,2015-06-04,7424152,Taylor,Jojo was very welcoming and accommodating .  The apartment was really clean with modern finishes and the best shower.  The area is lovely although a little far from the city centre I personally prefer the area to being downtown and felt that Potrero Hill was the type of neighbourhood I would live in.  Also the views are spectacular!  I recommend dinner in the Dogpatch while you are there it's a cool area just a short walk from the apartment.  I would definitely recommend this listing and stay here again if I returned to San Fran.
22536998,287919028,2018-07-08,106204903,Phillip,Vicky’s house is beautiful stylish cozy and larger than the pictures make the house appear. I’d definitely stay here again!!
20286823,319536022,2018-09-06,135604927,Gail,"From the moment we arrived to leaving we felt welcome and at home. Michael greeted us with a smile and that set the tone to our stay. 
There was absolutely everything and much more than you could hope for to make our stay a special one. 
The home was absolutely beautiful with fabulous decor and the garden was bliss!"
929468,7197920,2013-09-10,3838942,Veronica,The apartment is absolutely stunning! Very clean and very accurate to what the photos show and to what the description states. The ONLY bad thing about our stay was that the neighbors above us were EXTREMELY loud. We tried getting to bed around 10pm as we had just come in from a 9 hour drive but that didn't happen. We probably didn't fall asleep until 1am when the neighbors upstairs decided to go to bed. Then we woke up at 5:30am to the man talking on his cell phone. We could literally hear everything that was going on. Teeth brushing (gagging) shower use toilet flushing and all steps that were taken. We are also semi-light sleepers. If you are fine with noise then I'd say go for it! This place is awesome and in an awesome location of the Castro District but for the lighter sleepers out there this probably isn't the best place if you're looking for peace and quiet. The mattresses were comfy and bedding was very soft everything was very clean neat and tidy and the bathroom is gorgeous!
4718531,441282116,2019-04-21,55276415,Jamie,Wonderful relaxing stay at Mike’s. Very relaxed vibe absolutely ideal if you are a solo traveller. Highly recommended and will return.

Jason has been very helpful coordinating the stay. The apartment is very clean and luxuriously furnished.  The apartment is four blocks away from the Bart and the other guest were very friendly. "
2356554,15142709,2014-07-03,15480886,Josh,"This was my first time booking a bed and breakfast and I was a bit sceptical about it  but Tatiana changed my mind entirely. 

She was an amazing host who did everything she could do to help my girlfriend and I out. 

This was my first trip with my girlfriend and Tatiana made us feel right at home. Provided us with everything we need and more. 

Tatiana's place is absolutely beautiful super clean and perfectly decorated. It's everything you would want a bed & breakfast to be. 

Thank you so much again Tatiana from the bottom of our hearts and we hope to see you again in the future. 

We would rate Tatiana and her humble abode a 12 out of 10."
83257,77969368,2016-06-04,47586125,Natalia,Kim & Ahmed were wonderful hosts! I stayed in their home for the first month when I moved out to SF until the apartment I was supposed to rent was available. They were very generous with use of the whole space - bathroom living room kitchen and even shared food when they had made extra. I could come and go as I pleased their home is in a safe area and it's a comfortable walk to many attractions (i.e. Golden Gate Park Golden Gate Bridge Presidio Palace of Fine Arts). I had a wonderful stay! 
225933,278740633,2018-06-18,116162338,Lucy,Marcia’s home was clean safe bright and perfectly located for our San Francisco adventure! Marcia was lovely to interact with and very knowledgeable of the area. I would absolutely recommend her place to a friend!!

99094,277200406,2018-06-15,51576892,Glen,Really good crawl round some awesome bars we likely wouldn't have found ourselves. Good drinks deals too that make it cheap when you're out! Host is lovely and takes care of the group well. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to explore Williamsburg and meet some cool people. Thanks!
8101297,262669804,2018-05-09,181843683,Jennifer,Highly recommend - location is perfect for the Marina and adjacent areas host is friendly room is big and comfy... My only disappointment was that the house dog liked my brother more than he did me

La habitación Está separada lo que da mucha intimidad.  Lo único mejorable es la entrada de luz natural pero no es tan crítico en un viaje que uno está conociendo todo el día la ciudad!
muchas gracias ponge un muy buen host"
15832358,212035933,2017-11-15,156530998,Thomas,This was my first experience with AirBNB and I could not have been happier. David and Jake always made time to make me feel welcome and included. Central location rainfall showerhead washer/dryer access & a roomy closet are just some of the highlights & Gabriel their Bulldog will melt your heart.
6169292,286230538,2018-07-05,62158676,Sebastian,We arrived early and they were very kind to let us check in and have access to our rooms at around 10am. Great service and very nice people
479072,536942373,2019-09-27,159034015,Esteban Dominic,The location is great as others have mentioned. The unit is underneath the home and one thing you are not warned about are the children who seemingly have a rugby match that starts at 5:45am and goes until they are led off to school at 8am. The bathroom and kitchen were not equipped with hand soap or any other soap. Viola was out of town for work and informed me to text her husband. I sent a text message regarding an issue and he responded the next day at check out time. I would look at alternative places in the future.
6957662,89583610,2016-07-29,2122500,Katrin,Gary's Apartment is a wonderful place to stay and explore San Francisco. We would love to come back.
6365190,211389341,2017-11-12,66126043,Juan,The place is ok.
32378158,465462119,2019-06-08,137880649,Dorothy,I know you are in San Francisco but if you stay here plan to not sleep.  It is very noisy 24/7 from construction going on traffic and the people that you are renting from. There is nothing to keep any light out of the room or give privacy except thin white curtains.  You either have daylight or the light from the street all of the time.  If it's cold there is no way to heat the room.  The room is on street level and there was a homeless person rummaging through the garbage in the middle of the night that was 5 feet from our window.  Would not recommend.  We checked out early and found a four star hotel through Priceline that was the same price.
22586319,477655187,2019-06-28,216090654,Olivia,The house was spotless and perfect for a quick stay. Jean always responded quickly and was very helpful.

2203283,75409248,2016-05-21,42417401,Kenneth,"Ming was not there during my stay but she was very responsive whenever I had any questions. The space is in a great safe area that has a ton of delicious food (Go two streets to Clement for great restaurants).

The apartment itself is very clean and works very well for one. Although I didn't say in the apartment that long (I was out exploring San Francisco) I enjoyed it very much.

It's in a prime location in my opinion — one street away from Geary a main road that takes you straight to downtown San Francisco (the No. 38 bus) and also a few blocks away from Golden Gate Park."
12725886,250325411,2018-04-04,173204314,Deborah,Debbie was such a great host and we especially enjoyed the deck off of the bedroom.
17305040,201137899,2017-10-07,60231662,Ryan,Great place for a traveling couple. Stuart gave us very detailed instructions for check in and check out and even provided a list of recommended restaurants and bars in the area. Great experience overall.

3114387,40891375,2015-08-03,29952164,Jim,"Everything was great!

Julie met us at the apartment which met our needs in every way.

The street car ran right in front of the building which was very convenient for us - we didn't have a car.  One way on the street car goes to the beach (breakfast!) the other to 9th and Irving and lots of restaurants then to downtown.

The street car was noisy but it didn't bother us at all.

The apartment is the second floor of a 2 story building.  The first floor is a business.  As a result the apartment was absolutely quiet with no concerns about bothering anyone.

Thanks Julie!  We'll strongly consider using again if we return!"
14671675,410860400,2019-02-10,30633164,Jiawen,Pete and Jon are such good hosts of room which I lived. Although it's my first trip in SF. I would definitely to live next time. It's really convenient to supermarketrestaurantbar even pet store.

23763871,280657697,2018-06-23,69997383,Montserrat,The bed was beyond comfortable and there was so many pillows which was great for me because I recently rolled my ankle and had to keep it elevated. The room is beautiful and the bathroom was so clean! Carl waited late when traffic pushed my arrival time and when confused about parking I sent a text and Jack responded quickly. The location was perfect for our plans nothing was more than 20 minutes away. I wish I was able to stay longer but definitely will try to stay at Jack’s place when I’m back in San Francisco! 
25213152,426035270,2019-03-19,248076157,Farzan,Their place is incredibly clean. It’s right across the Golden Gate Park which has a lot to explore! You will definitely be pleased with their place!

14488234,303594866,2018-08-07,107360144,Wellington,I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in San Francisco. It is a beautiful home and the location is great - not far from places such as Castro or the Mission. Additionally Jason and Jerret were incredibly accommodating from checkin to checkout. I was given towels robe and a cute pair of slippers. You also have access to Netflix and coffee if those minor details matter to you. Overall I was thoroughly pleased with my stay.

The flat is beautiful (pics don't do it justice) and in an excellent location for transports and nice places to eat \ shop (la corneta taqueria is super!)
Unfortunately we had only two days to visit SF but definitely would love to be Glen's guests next time.

734839,127243125,2017-01-16,96976808,Janine,This flat was in a perfect location to experience all that San Francisco has to offer. Kenji was the perfect host and offered  suggestion from restaurants to places to visit. Decor was super cute clean and was all about the San Francisco charm. :)
4052091,52038631,2015-10-26,28297718,James,"Beth and Tom are lovely people.
This was only a 2 night stay for us after a long trip from Vegas and up the coast road to San Francisco.
they both made us feel so welcome in their beautiful home. 
I can't recommend this a place enough if your planning a trip to this city the location is great so you can walk everywhere [ maybe taxi home as from the bay area a little up hill ! ] but that is normal in SF.
We will be back again one year and Beth and Tom will be our 1st choice.
Our room was the sunny room which was perfect the bathroom was next door to it .
Thank-you Beth and Tom great memories ....

Notre séjour s'est parfaitement déroulé et il n y a eu aucune mauvaise surprise (toute la maison est propre et la chambre était spacieuse pour un couple).

4105958,53010041,2015-11-03,35357,Susan,Wonderful place to stay lovely location very welcoming host. Paul went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and was available for any questions we had. The apartment is lovely and comfortable - love the garden deck!
501057,249133545,2018-04-01,6928543,Jakob,The house has an excellent location and is very charming with lots of personality. Absolutely loved staying here. Followed several of Penelope's personal tips and they were all spot on.
15179182,165725024,2017-07-02,21686995,Paula,Had a fabulous time! The decor was really nice the location was near a music venue we went to and when my friend ended up getting a migraine a not going out with us so we pulled out the Apples to Apples game and had fun for a while staying in while we played some good music. The beds were SOOO comfortable felt like we were in a Hilton! Will definitely come back!
3325741,228061751,2018-01-17,30799448,John,Robert and Juan Carlos have a beautiful place that’s close by to the Castro and the surrounding neighborhoods. They were also great at accommodating my check in schedule. Definitely recommend staying with them.
22396902,301785749,2018-08-04,63932049,Martina,"Everything was perfect! 
Brian and Stephen are kind and helpful. ""The Library"" is very cosy and bright. The cats are adorable and the location is great for public transport. 
Absolutely recommended!"
24043373,361105843,2018-12-22,117297522,Elizabeth,Yvonne's place is in a good location to explore the city.  We were visiting friends who lived about 15 mins away so it was very convenient.  Nice and quiet for sleeping.  The rooms were spacious.  It would be nice for the living area to have a better couch and a TV in the main area or a TV in each of the bedrooms would be nice.  There is no TV in the space.  The kitchenette was functional but would be nice to have a set of four coffee mugs plates glasses etc instead of paper and plastic.  Also - although there is free parking on the street it can be hard to find a spot and beware of the street cleaning on Friday morning - we got an unexpected ticket.  Otherwise we had a great stay!
29192965,522275991,2019-09-01,234197648,Claudio,Great location. Host always in touch. Comfortable place. Easy  to reach in public transportation.
8685716,80243149,2016-06-17,2180903,James,Feels like a hotel clean but plain.  Centrally located. Good value.
17016637,458211516,2019-05-25,128158603,Kanika,May's place was very convenient as it was in Daly City with great food options near by hidden beaches and close proximity to San Francisco city. The room was very clean with little kitchennet available with kettle fridge tap microwave. We found parking on nearby street easily even though we arrived on a street cleaning eve. Communication was quick with clear instructions. May even provided bottled water. Would definitely come to this place again.
3486460,413620300,2019-02-17,157701980,Holly,Beautiful home! Host communicated very quickly whenever there was a question or concern. Beautiful views as well.

10251,2797821,2012-11-04,2981798,Chris,"From the top Roman picked us up from the airport despite our plane landing two hours late... (only a small fee for a huge help!!). The flat itself is lovely with plenty of space a well-equipped open kitchen leading into dining area. Provided basics in fridge and cupboard- (things like mayo salt pepper sugar ketchup coffee filters to name a few- a big help) as starters. Furniture and floors lovely cosy and felt like a real home. 
Importantly for us we were travelling with a toddler and it was easy to toddler-proof and then he was able to run around without concern!! 

There is a pretty little garden out back which we could use and we were encouraged to use lemons from their tree. 

Mission area itself takes a little to get used to but the place is very near handy bus routes which take you right into town without difficulty..."
7389541,566247852,2019-11-18,24947515,Jack,This is a wonderful apartment under the main house in a quiet charming and unique SF neighborhood! Very comfy good  and well-provisioned kitchen great shower(such a plus!) great bed and lots of pillows and comforters.  Restaurants bars organic grocery bike rental and public transport (N Judah line which gets you anywhere) all in easy walking distance. Just a few blocks to the beach with glorious sunsets. Michelle is a great host thoughtful attentive and pleasant.
8904047,145540803,2017-04-18,10638168,Regina,Excellent place for us a retired couple visiting family in the neighborhood!

6430646,174636283,2017-07-26,122694417,Michael,Unser Aufenthalt bei David war einfach großartig! In dem wunderbar liebevoll eingerichteten Zimmer haben uns von David selbstgemachte leckere Schoko-Cookies erwartet. Wir hatten einen abgegrenzten Bereich des Hauses für uns allein und trotzdem standen uns Davids Türen immer offen um ein bisschen zu quatschen und zu erzählen. David hat uns viele viele Tipps gegeben und geholfen unseren Aufenthalt in San Francisco und unsere weitere Reise schön zu gestalten. Wir haben uns bei David auf jeden Fall wie zu hause gefühlt und würden jederzeit wieder bei ihm unterkommen wollen und können einen Aufenthalt bei ihm nur wärmstens empfehlen! 
1759087,105231794,2016-09-30,82051220,Anjan,Nice place to stay.. Great view of San Francisco.. Lovely garden..Gerardo was very clear with communication and instructions..Lots of nice restaurants around..
8053887,259317794,2018-05-01,55056015,Terryl,Louise’s apartment in Twin Peaks is the best! The neighborhood is a quiet retreat from the busyness of sightseeing in San Francisco. It’s a Mecca for walking with tiny surprises like garden steps leading from one hill to the next and quiet uncrowded Parks tucked into the hillsides. The apartment itself is old world charm with big rooms ilarge comfy furniture and artwork. You can relax in the beautiful garden with a glass of wine tuck up on the couch to watch telly or check your email or read a book in the recliner in the sunny frint room. Be sure to check the pantry for staples before you buy more than what you need! There is plenty of street parking (mind the alternate side rules) and the neighborhood is uber/lyft friendly for those times when you’re going to a neighborhood that is not so accommodating of cars. This is truly a home away from home while traveling and a value. It was a breeze getting in Louise was available to solve any problems (of which there weren’t any) and we will definitely stay here again.
1531273,23793207,2014-12-10,17975280,Tom,I had a very pleasant stay in this apartment and found the host Jeanne extremely welcoming. The accommodation is in a fantastic location on Haight with easy access to most parts of the city. I was a little unlucky to be staying at a time when some repair work was being completed upstairs but this didn't last for long and Jeanne was extremely quick to apologise and very generous in making up for this! I'd stay again! 
10418322,197510234,2017-09-25,47734776,Lisa,We stayed for 2 nights in San Fransisco. We were made to feel very welcome the room was lovely and the house was beautiful! The restaurant suggestions were very helpful! The location was great and we would certainly come back.
2738331,30604426,2015-04-25,27479195,Odile,Notre première expérience de logement avec AIR B&B s'est vraiment bien passée. Flip n'était pas là à notre arrivée mais sa femme nous a gentiment fait visiter les lieux et immédiatement nous nous sommes sentis chez nous. La situation dans SF est parfaite le quartier vivant et agréable à vivre. Le WiFi ok.  Le logement propre et bien agencé nous avons pu profiter du soleil dans le jardin les jours de beau temps. Nous pourrons recommander Flip à nos amis qui viendront à SF.

My experience at your home was absolutely perfect. 
I felt at home to come and go as I pleased which was a lot as I was always up early and home very late. 
You have put the most comfiest bed in that apartment.. It was incredibly. 
The apartment was spotless organised and close to everything.
I simply loved staying at your place. 
I will happily return again!"
37994895,523927677,2019-09-04,126273585,Le,Possibly the cheapest place you can get in SF. Good location as it is an easy walk to Union Square.

5117701,73891364,2016-05-11,62989545,Xionghao,Stephan's place is located in a perfect spot where you can easily enjoy tons of delicious Chinese food as well as walking around the downtown area. Inside the apartment it is very clean and spacious. There are two queen beds which are enough to accommodate up to 4 persons. Overall I love this living experience in SF. 
209514,45660180,2015-09-05,30638871,Laura,We had four great nights at Josh's place. The apartment was big and clean. The bed was very comfortable and our room had i big tv too. The location was very nice but the parking was quite difficult. We bought a 3-day bus pass on the first day so that we didn't have to find a parking space the other three nights. Communication was quick and Josh was very helpful in giving us all the information that we needed.
6560870,517830384,2019-08-25,133578476,Katie,An amazing place to stay close by to the city. Sage and Babs were very accommodating and quick to reply and we loved all the additional information provided about San Francisco and all the snacks and toiletries provided! Would definitely stay here again
297897,124796727,2017-01-02,24043165,Luke,We loved our stay at Tim's place over New Years. The location is excellent. A short walk to Ocean Beach and Golden Gate Park. It's also very close to the MUNI which we used several times to get around. The house was comfortable and the neighborhood safe.  We also loved the Museum passes We would definitely come back and visit again! Thanks Tim!
10886231,106185526,2016-10-04,76724779,Ran,it's so nice to stay in Roy's house. Roy and her husband are very kind. and Roy's birds are beautiful!
24680396,469452949,2019-06-14,54639911,Emma And Trevor,Staying at Andrews was extremely convenient and cozy. It’s in a great location quite (even though it’s a shared space) and very comfortable.  It is probably the cleanest place I’ve stayed in as well. He goes above and beyond with his space and I know I appreciated it during my stay!
6272816,126806826,2017-01-14,24177790,Fee,Praise is a fantastic host! We had a great time staying with her & her food recommendations are fantastic! 
15346876,152637105,2017-05-17,38030640,Lynn,"Kamal is a wonderful host! His home is spotless and he really goes out of his way to take care of his guests. The view from the living room and deck is simply amazing. The room is very comfortable and the attached bath very convenient. After walking around the city all day it was nice to come ""home"" and fall asleep on the Tempurpedic mattress. The location is amazing. We were able to walk to many of the sites San Francisco has to offer. I cannot speak highly enough about Kamal or his home. If I'm ever back in San Francisco I'll definitely stay with Kamal again. Thanks Kamal for making my first Airbnb experience so wonderful!"
30042211,408817530,2019-02-05,223292468,Finlay,Had a great time staying here excellent location and super helpful hosts. The rooms were sparkling clean and had everything we needed during our stay. We’d love to stay again!
6600081,86905344,2016-07-18,37278790,John Robert,Everything about Del's place was perfect!  The home itself is lovely modern and full of light.  The bedroom itself is great and has everything you could need.  Del provided every amenity that you would find in a hotel room including wifi an iron bedside chocolate and sparkling water - just to name a few!  The room is very bright and clean and the bed was very comfortable.  With the touch of a remote one can close or open the blinds to their preference.  The rest of the house was great as well.  The very modern bathroom is located just down the hall.  Del took the time to show me a thorough guidebook that she created for out of town guests showing them all the local restaurants sights and transportation options.  Overall Del and her family were very welcoming hosts and made me feel at home.  I would highly recommend this Airbnb!
7562249,79331515,2016-06-12,56546238,MaryBeth,Great stay at 709 Broderick with my husband and 18 mo old baby. We were provided a high chair and pack and play which really helped. Small kitchen with just enough supplies for us to make breakfast and lunch. Really comfortable bed. Cute garden cute neighborhood with great suggestions for food from Katharine. 
11359996,69273565,2016-04-10,58163589,Abigail,A group of 5 of us rented this house for a long weekend. The apartment was perfect! All of the beds and rooms were comfortable spacious and clean. The apartment is in a safe fun and convenient neighborhood. Lastly Rolando was extremely helpful and responsive. I definitely would recommend this apartment to any group!
21217809,265910372,2018-05-18,48647312,Edward,Great location for getting into the City. Nice clean house. Cortland Street was a great bonus for restaurants
1623609,25106073,2015-01-06,9777458,John,"This was the best Airbnb place we have stayed in so far.  The suite is very large clean and quite.  It is within comfortable walking distances from a bunch of nice eating places.  

Betty met us when we arrived as Ingrid was still at work.  Betty was a most welcoming and helpful host.  Jacquay Ingrid's partner took us for an unexpected  introductory ride through the Mission District which was both good and very useful.   

We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and will come back again."
21334,4314432,2013-04-27,5770899,Erin,Joe is so nice. His place is comfy stocked with food. Convenient to  everything. I had a great stay. Thanks Joe! 
15132855,177428762,2017-08-02,79510318,Therese,What a beautiful home!  It is in such an amazing location in the Marina.  You can walk to the Marina Harbor or to many iconic San Francisco landmarks i.e. Palace of Fine Arts Crissy Field the Golden Gate Bridge Chestnut Street etc. The grocery store and coffee is right around the corner.  The neighborhood is extremely safe and is very quiet.  Erin was incredibly warm and inviting.  The home was clean beautifully designed and very comfortable.  You have your own private entrance to the entire bottom floor of the home.  We enjoyed our stay in this Air bnb!
494111,357249162,2018-12-09,13714176,Penny,This place was exactly as advertised.  Not fancy but spacious and had everything we needed.  The location was perfect for us near the Presidio and the bed was especially comfortable.  We will stay there again in the future.
6331695,501530882,2019-08-03,39101898,Bo,"Danielle's extra apartment is a lovely place. It is ideal for 2-3 persons. We only had breakfast in the apartment since the kitchen is not for cooking but since there are so many options for eating out that's not a problem at all. 
The view from the apartment is spectacular and the the neighborhood is very nice and quiet. There's absolutely no noise from traffic. It's very easy to get from the apartment and to downtown San Francisco. It takes approx. 30-45 minutes with tram or bus depending on the route. With car from the apartment to the airport takes approx. 20 minutes and is very easy. 
there are lots of nice cafés within walking distance from the apartment and especially if you hop on a bus to the Castro area. Highly recommended."
287907,4076711,2013-04-08,5133154,Nakiesha,Wonderful place to stay! Adrian was very helpful and stayed in contact with me throughout the entire process. He was very prompt with getting back to me with any questions. The home is close to the BART and many shops and resturant. I would recommend their home and hospitality to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in San Francisco!!!

9075976,221758642,2017-12-27,68597292,José,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Read and Gretchen's lovely home near the beach!  Their communication was warm timely and accommodating!  Their home is tidy and and thoughtfully arranged for guests.  A wonderful experience!
1925206,210140489,2017-11-07,46258040,Kenny,You will enjoy staying here as I did. The location is convenient the room is very comfortable with just about everything you need and expect from a hotel. Best of all Joshua is a caring host regularly checking if I have everything I need and comfortable. When I arrived late due to flight delays he fixed me up with a hot dinner! Can't thank him enough!
23354077,500788361,2019-08-02,268341542,Neal,Beautiful decor very nice bathroom. Quiet street beautiful flowers and landscaping in front. Really just a nice quiet retreat after a long day of SF sightseeing. Nice comfy bed. The host family owns and lives on the property and are very nice. It's a bit uphill from shops and eateries but you can easily walk down and Uber up and being up in the hills with city views is very SF anyway. Overall we loved it.
21186680,517819673,2019-08-25,198253644,Marisa,"Fantastic location good natural light in the apartment comfortable for four people to stay for about a week. James and Kim were so nice and communicative. I booked this space for my in-laws visiting from France and the hosts were very accommodating for these conditions. 

One note: the steps are steep - very normal for San Francisco but might be challenging for people with mobility challenges. As my in-laws are older I was concerned about this but they are generally able-bodied and were totally fine."
918341,303183489,2018-08-06,118552057,Annabelle,We had an amazing time at Kepa’s getaway! Her beautiful house and garden were everything we expected and more. Kepa was a great host offering great communication and local tips would definitely stay here again if I am ever back on San Francisco!! 
348580,2917275,2012-11-19,1738468,David,"Bernal Heights is a really pleasant area to stay - far enough from the city to feel quiet and neighbourhoody close enough to be able to bike around easily. Mark's place is conveniently close to some great restaurants and lively bars a Safeways a Walgreens and the J stops nearby. 

Mark was very accommodating about my bicycle and we had good communication throughout. The lack of apartment-wide heating was a drawback at this time of year: the only source of heat is a gas fire in the living room which is probably not an issue during the summer but makes the kitchen a chilly place to dine. In general the apartment was a little uncleanly - not to any extent that made me want to complain to Mark but if you're sensitive to dust this might not be the place for you. There were a lof of mousetraps around which I don't mind but might upset some people. 

Overall I had a great stay."
1992217,35373688,2015-06-18,2514497,Marin,My husband and I had a great stay at Peter's wonderful home. The room is spacious and very comfortable - great bed and shower. We felt very welcome in the apartment which is very nice and has beautiful views. The neighborhood is quiet and accessible to several interesting places within walking distance. Breakfast was delicious and we so enjoyed meeting Peter. 
18809842,331826035,2018-10-03,2738179,Juliane,"The house and the individual rooms are nicely decorated and very clean. The apartment has a well equipped kitchen with everything (coffee cookies etc.) you need and a stylish living room with a huge TV screen and free Netflix account. Everything was fine and we felt very comfortable. We can definitely recommend Avas house.   

What you need to know: 
If you don’t rent both rooms on the top floor you need to share it with another guest. No risk no fun. Our flatmate was a young single us-guy. Nice and talkative."
1104912,106032319,2016-10-03,139710,Janet,"We enjoyed our stay at Chani's place and really liked it's proximity to Golden Gate Park and the beach!
Chani's communicated quickly upon booking and sent the instructions for entry over a week before arrival.
We didn't have any problems and we're comfortable during our weekend stay. 
Because it's a lower level unit you can hear a lot of footsteps  and voices from children above but that's just the nature of the set up."
12725886,488241366,2019-07-14,167434538,Ashley,The location was perfect and the room was clean and spacious. Debbie is super nice and had great suggestions on places to eat in the area! Plus her dog Yoda is adorable!
9051149,82456028,2016-06-27,42176306,Robert,Elmer really was the perfect host. The place is great and set up like a hotel so many amenities nice touches and Elmer makes you feel very welcome and offers use of all the facilities etc. The place itself is lovely great room all very clean. Location is good just on the edge of Castro public transport about 20 mins to fishermans wharf. Have moved on now and are genuinely missing the place elmer and London (cutest corgi in the world). Would highly recommend to all to stay here

5345792,553688464,2019-10-24,2369302,Fred,"Unbelievable appartment overlooking San Francisco. The area is phenomenal filled with amazing homes. Leo and Dan's place is magical. As soon as you get in you are immediately attracted to the beautiful view. The decoration is very stylish and modern great open kitchen with a huge marble counter beautifull bedroom room great comfy bed and great private bathroom.
Leo and Dan are in and out and make sure you have everything you need. They are super sweet and laid back. The extra bonus is the roof top where you can hang out and have coffee or a drink in front of the most amazing view you have ever seen."
3924524,135178714,2017-03-03,27924767,Chris,Very clean and comfortable place to stay. Small deli next door was convenient for getting coffee and breakfast in the morning. Whole foods within walking distance. Easy to take an uber anywhere in SF.
2538807,15533930,2014-07-11,15629810,Juha,"Me and my girlfriend had a great stay in this studio. We didn't run into our host during the stay and didn't need to contact him as everything was laid out well.

The area was quiet as promised and the subway was conveniently a short walk away. The street had plenty of parking space aswell. The studio itself was comfy and clean with plenty of space for the two of us. The kitchen had necessary equipment for basic cooking. Huge washing and drying machines also available which was nice.

Overall a great place to stay in SF!"
11939561,232693618,2018-02-05,51571888,Mark,This is a terrific place. I've been staying in airbnb apartments for nearly a decade and this apartment is easily in my top 5 - very good shower and bed. I'm looking forward to returning.
1148625,30945549,2015-04-29,30693192,G,Dennis has a great place and the location is excellent ! I felt very comfortable there.  Parking in S.F. is impossible so having a place to park your car is just another plus. The place is very nice clean bright and well kept. I had my own powder room. The shared bath kitchen dining and living room where all convenient and comfortable as well. I felt free to come and go. I enjoyed my stay and the whole experience was much nicer then staying at a hotel. Thanks Dennis !

148627,21025443,2014-10-10,12463790,Kathy,Great location. Big Bus stop just at the end of the block. Lovely courtyard nice on those warm days. Everything was as described and very handy with the garage.
8048653,540021376,2019-10-02,138392997,Lisa,Such a nice room with a supernice bathroom. Tv with Netflix/YouTube etc was perfect. A big kitchen with access to everything. This place was SUPER clean and smelled nice would recommend everyone to rent it. The only negative thing I can think of was the location didn’t feel like the “safest” part of San Francisco. But as long as you are aware of that and ok with it it’s no problem!
9119249,245819045,2018-03-23,31672018,Dylan,Jeff was quick to respond. It is a nice spot. I would go back again for sure.

2455325,287923231,2018-07-08,21155887,Hesham,"5-star stay. Mariam is an outstanding host. She gives clear instructions and she’s super responsive. 

Mariam’s place is immaculate and has great style. We specifically chose this airbnb for its location. There are a good number of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. It’s also just a short walk to the Presidio and a short drive to Golden Gate Park."
191632,338137114,2018-10-18,90110724,Mary,"We loved staying here so much! Maria was very easy to communicate with about leaving our bags there before check in and then checked on us after to make sure we were settled in. I loved the neighborhood and was so sad to leave!

We also found some great recommendations in the little guest book!"
15220043,244476853,2018-03-18,9857476,Matt,Amazing location and amazing hosts. Everything was thought out and cozy. I highly highly recommend this space.
8907289,185835987,2017-08-22,3256055,Kess,"Great location great host and great room! 
Right next to 24th street where there's amazing south/central american food and family run businesses and walking distance to the whole mission district.
The room was big and light bed was super comfy and the heritage San Francisco bathroom was charming.
Lindy was a great host and this was the most well organised Airbnb I've been too. The breakfast granola is delicious and a great way to start the day!"
7086626,194076206,2017-09-15,126672920,Drew,Exactly as advertised. The place was clean and easily accessible
1392204,334367192,2018-10-08,80939451,Bo,"We love Dee Dee’s awesome place and Dee’s friendly dog Sammy!
We spent 4 nights a family of four with two girls aged 12 and 14. Both parents and kids fell in love with the spectacular views and the quit calming neighbourhood - a nice refuge from SFs urban charm. 
Dee is the perfect host as she is balancing perfectly between giving space and privacy on one hand and giving tips sharing stories or discussing bigger issues on the other.
We would totally recommend this place and would definetily do it again!"
21310005,287163447,2018-07-07,108505133,Jason,This is a great room in the middle of the mission and castro action. The room is stylish clean and the little details have been considered. The private entrance makes you feel like a local and makes for a great experience in SF. Great bed with high quality sheets and towels.
15070065,277157691,2018-06-15,21557005,Arvind,"The retreat was extremely comfortable. Annria was accommodating on the check in times and gave me a detailed run down of the whole place. I had a great stay and would definitely recommend it.
"
22968438,314505057,2018-08-26,104396425,Matt,"A very clean and organised space! Had everything we needed and everything in the apartment was easily accessible to us. Only met Shaun once but was friendly and welcoming when we did meet him. 
The nearest metro was 10 minutes walk away however wasn’t particularly reliable."
16896129,362186685,2018-12-25,28531738,Asher,We had a great stay. Amy's place is central to all parts of the city and makes for a great home-base. Check-in and check-out was very easy. The flat had everything you might need to make feel like you are at home in San Francisco. We look forward to staying again in the future.
17534690,475787706,2019-06-24,593731,Mountaine,It's a good place.
24224031,456855208,2019-05-22,206963370,Ian,Awesome experience and place all around. Jonathan’s place was clean (even saw the place vacuumed and organized everyday myself) had the needed amenities and was in a great location (for activities and noise level was low). Jonathan himself was communicative and very accommodating. If you’re in need for a quick visit or just on a getaway trip Jonathan’s place is the place to be.
31695049,535610061,2019-09-24,189469970,Bruno,"as first experience with airbnb I could not dream better
emily's house is just perfect
The location near the park and connections with busses.
the room was immaculately clean
It was well equipped and had everything you need for a good stay
Emily is adorable and does everything to make your stay in the best conditions possible
Thank you for the drinks and snacks!
If you are traveling solo this room is the one for you!"
4105958,86983501,2016-07-18,10090044,Jinheng,So nice to live there. Paul will be a good guide for San Francisco tour.
3257886,180921253,2017-08-11,17321062,D,Absolutely a great experience.  Location was good for our plans.  Kathy and Matt were welcoming and very helpful.  Highly recommend.
12154878,147241129,2017-04-25,4844197,Coline,The apartment is well located. Although it's not well furnished there is anything you need.  
15432669,223133946,2017-12-31,137558087,Reed,Great location in the Sunset.
5548977,30458733,2015-04-22,4743148,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I LOVED Todd and Tayana's place! Good local grub easy access to two bus lines and provided bikes took the modern living space with beautiful back yard to the next level. The fantastic Legion of Honor Museum is across the street. Todd was super helpful with our questions. Our only critique was that light sleepers may be bothered by nearby day care in the early morning or the adjacent bar at night. However if you like pinball or ping pong having the bar around the corner more than makes up for it!
We hope to stay with Todd and Tatyana again on our next trip!"
17753503,314484197,2018-08-26,30730647,Emily,"Top notch!
Mario & Junior were incredibly kind and generous hosts! Their house is beautiful and our room was immaculate quiet private and very comfortable. It was an ideal place to stay for our weekend in SF. The neighborhood appeared to be safe and parking was easy. Mini fridge and microwave were an added plus as well! Thank you!"
516836,36704773,2015-06-30,34395565,Adrienne,Fran's house was lovely and so was she. We especially enjoyed watching the sunset over the city each night from the hot tub. Absolutely beautiful! Parking was a breeze. 
2770268,12954447,2014-05-15,14575742,Adam,Raman is a welcoming and helpful host. The location in Potrero Hill is quiet and with easy access to downtown SF. Don't miss the local Whole Foods supermarket!
20608059,328975103,2018-09-27,6527584,Marco,"This place is just beautiful. It is in twin peaks a lovely place to stay! The room is big enough for 2 people and the bathroom is nice and clean.
If you wanna stay somewhere cozy this is the right place :)
Carol was really nice and answered all of our questions."
28539243,347780363,2018-11-11,11935040,Suzette,The room was perfect. We had direct access to the backyard from our bedroom. We also had access to a pelton bike and great snacks such as la croix water coffee trail mix seaweed and other great snacks. Faina and her husband were very nice in welcoming us. she responded to all of my notes within ten minutes and showed us around the home and where we could find extra linens. It is a good distance from downtown as it was only a 15-20 minute drive in an uber. Also in a 10 min walk you can make it to a main street with restaurants and a whole foods. I would totally recommend this for anyone's stay in the bay.
84777,480455827,2019-07-02,210190895,Julio,Great Place and Location ;)
8117667,74556584,2016-05-15,32234937,James,Perfect location for exploring Golden Gate Park and the Botanical Gardens.  Close to all sorts of great restaurants and within striking distance of all SF has to offer.
11437331,337579373,2018-10-16,1102056,Carsten,This is a great place centrally located and very comfortable. Maria is a great host hear apartment simply beautiful. Would definitely stay again.
31313300,518459646,2019-08-26,89514336,Jan Felix,Lauren's apartment is very nice clean and beautifully located within a nice neighborhood. Also good to get around in the city. Would always come back.

I stayed with my partner and parents for two nights and the apartment was so clean and stylish and convenient.
Danielle made sure no detail was left unattended and the process was so organized and simple we never had any questions or complaints. 
Would highly recommend..."

8277718,270307310,2018-05-28,108156690,Eduardo & Catherine,Clean room/bath as shown in listing.  Parking is limited so you may have to park on a steep incline and walk a little. Room is nice and comfortable but the pillows are very thin. Room is next to the living room with the TV so it can get a  little noisy during the day. Melania was very pleasent. good value/location for SF.
467507,458186451,2019-05-25,9195790,Maggie,This apartment is a brilliant base in a cool suburb in San Francisco. Jennifer is a wonderful host who has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable.  The apartment is very well appointed with quality throughout - the kitchen equipment bed linen towels etc.and there is useful information about local eateries and how to easily get public transport into the centre of San Francisco.  We appreciated retreating to our apartment after busy days. There is a lovely deck at the back for guests' use and a jacuzzi too. A great place to stay.
6643496,205027341,2017-10-20,150913990,Lim,Great location really near to twin peaks!
8328410,115241231,2016-11-22,70788018,Mackenzie,Great location for checking out the city close to all amenities and great places to eat. Ruben and Teresa were easy to work with and very helpful 
1827177,470886784,2019-06-16,7672406,Arek,A really nice and stylish place in a fun neighborhood Ashish is an amazing host who was very friendly and helpful making my visit even more fun
2539953,512896197,2019-08-18,119269772,Chris,I expected the house to be smaller than it was in the pictures but we were pleasantly surprised --it was very spacious.   It easily accomodated our 9 person party.     It's a great house and fairly close to restaurants/bars.  The owners were easy to work with as well.  I would highly recommend  this property.
21594483,265610838,2018-05-17,67604397,David,A lovely place to stay. Close to transport links into the city centre. Easy parking. Two double beds with comfortable sofa bed to sleep up to six. Use of washer and drier in garage. The host responded promptly to all enquiries. Will recommend this place walking distance to beach. Perfectly clean and lots of little touches. Thank you.
4902855,63258003,2016-02-21,33524507,Katherine,Only great experiences staying here. This was my third time and the check-in/check-out was seamless. The room and hall bathrooms were immaculate welcoming and well-equipped with soaps hair dryers etc. All that you would need for a crash pad in San Francisco. Just noticed on this trip that this place is also really close to lots of great food and some cool bars. Easily walking distance to all of the above.
10469182,332204251,2018-10-04,6022348,Christian,Sehr gute Lage ruhig gute Ausstattung mit kleinem Esstisch Mikrowelle und sogar ein Gartensitzplatz. Der Coastal Trail ist nur ein paar Schritte entfernt - ideal für Jogging am Morgen.
7918,264547,2011-05-15,555847,Andreas,Aaron was a great host at a perfect location in Cole Valley. While the room and the building are a little run-down it's a great value and I'd be happy to stay again.
24129914,407024929,2019-01-31,37899687,Niki,great attention to detail super clean and homey. We had a wonderful stay and the location was perfect. the beautiful backyard was a true delight a little oasis in the middle of the city.
585225,107561621,2016-10-11,31709654,Helen,Apartment was very nice great location close to transport. Lovely touch with bottle of wine on arrival thank you so much Gabe.
8102262,65575513,2016-03-15,34237805,Zhuoqin,Located between airport and downtown this house is very appropriate for those who're interested in exploring SF. If you rent a car parking is also very convenient.  Hal is a great talker. Several conversation with him help me learn the real life of SF. In addition his suggestions for other trip to Monterey is  very helpful!
585225,24409327,2014-12-28,93372,Bozena,Great space in lovely quiet neighborhood! The wine chocolate and espresso machine were unexpected touches that made the space welcoming and homey. Thanks do much for a great experience- highly recommended
1107014,6469232,2013-08-13,1479512,Steven,Julia's house was perfect for our group of 5.  The house was beautiful and roomy and had amazing views of the city.  It was seamless to find it and check-in and the location can't be beat.  Julia was attentive and upfront (the third shower didn't work and the hot tub would not be available during our stay) very early on in the process.  We would highly recommend Julia's house!
5007358,286659657,2018-07-06,46406858,Colin,It was a nice stay.
5884735,147028560,2017-04-24,54532484,Sonya,Mouwafac is a gem! He is very kind and accommodated my late arrival. His place is beautiful and quiet. The shower is amazing and his place is very clean. I had no problems while staying at his place and hope to stay there again in the future! 
10787814,150159908,2017-05-07,123007480,Abbey,The host canceled this reservation 42 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2046634,41320381,2015-08-07,24335222,Kristoffer,The handover of the keys was uncomplicated our room as well as the bathroom was clean and our bed was comfortable. From the appartment to the city center it takes about one hour and there are multiple shopping possibilites available where you can buy things for daily need (especially very cheap to what we experienced everywhere else). All in all we had a nice stay in San Francisco. 
2169208,541700411,2019-10-05,13573055,Taylor,Pierre’s apartment is great. My girlfriend and I stayed here for a little over a month while we searched for an apartment. His place is in a very convenient location as it is near multiple bus lines that go downtown (About a 20-25 minute trip). Also it is a 5-10 minute walk to Trader Joe’s and Target. The apartment is clean and comes equipped with everything you’d need (wifi kitchen supplies TV iron etc.). There was more than enough room for two people. We felt really comfortable there and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood. Pierre was always very responsive and helpful. I would definitely recommend staying here!
14488234,191503283,2017-09-07,102556831,Peter,Immaculate. Cleanest I've stayed in. Definitely top-rated hosts.
9972077,92328956,2016-08-08,53784310,Alexes,Absolutely amazing!!  The place is so beautiful I was baffled. My experience couldn't have been better. The decor and layout of the building couldn't have been better. And parking was very easy never had to park any farther then a couple feet away. 
1301798,71147044,2016-04-24,3707719,Bassel,I stayed at Yong's place for a week. It was easy to get to and coordinate with Yong. The room was clean and spacious and some of the recommendations provided came in handy I'm still craving that ice cream sandwich place! The Internet was fast and all the facilities were good. I didn't meet Yong as he was out of town. The street was quiet and there are some cool place around and close to public transportation. Make sure you don't mind staying in Mission district. I enjoyed my stay.
99094,313112964,2018-08-25,38986722,Kirk,Great experience. Meet people from around the world. Great vibes all around. I would highly suggest booking a crawl with Sarah. Will book again next time I am in NY!
22705767,261676125,2018-05-06,2804672,Eléna,"Nous avons passé un super séjour chez Mark ! Qui est adorable et accueillant. 
Il est réactif et à été très arrangeant pour l’entrée et sortie des lieux. 
La chambre est spacieuse cosy propre. Elle donne sur la rue mais ça n’a pas été trop dérangeant. La salle de bain est très bien bonne pression de la douche et propre elle aussi.
L’appartement est très agréable et décoré avec goût. 
Le quartier est top pleins de bonnes adresses pas loin. 
Pas toujours facile de se garer mais on finit par y arriver. 
Nous recommandons vraiment ce logement et on reviendra sans hésiter ! 
Thanks again Mark !"
8554141,357826179,2018-12-11,166117447,Yun Jin,Nice location and clean. We could have towel everyday and hair dryer but you should bring them from the front desk. The worst thing was that water wasn’t hot enough to shower and the room wasn’t warm enough as the radiator didn’t work. But the good thing was that elevator works so we didn’t have to carry our luggage all the way up to our room:)
8904047,179871186,2017-08-08,1318015,Manoj,Amazing location - updating furnishings!  Definitely a good place for a couple or an individual to stay and enjoy all of the Mission!
23611,33596489,2015-05-30,31544122,Eros,"Não tenho palavras para agradecer a hospitalidade e o carinho que Gina teve durante minha hospedagem em sua casa! 

Foi uma experiência fantástica ser um hospede de Gina Com certeza quando voltar a SF ficarei em sua residência ."
99094,558361839,2019-11-03,131992980,Camille,Great evening out with people from all over the world!
6245649,146136961,2017-04-21,37169485,Norm,Thanks so much. This place was perfect for a quick business trip. 
21327347,434873186,2019-04-08,65308482,Julie,This place was the perfect spot for our small family of three. The photos are accurate very modernly furnished and clean albeit small. The host even left us snacks in the fridge and fresh fruit in case we got hungry. The best part is the host offered a toddler bed for my 4 year old so he didn't have to sleep in our bed. The place is in a quiet neighborhood so it was a good place to retire after a long day at the park. I would just be aware if staying here with young kids consider renting a car since they offer free street parking. Although this place is technically close to Golden Gate Park it's not the end of the park where most children's activities are. You need to drive at least 10 minutes to get to things like the Cal academy of sciences Japanese garden or De Young museum. We ended up doing a lot of ride sharing. You might also want to bring your own pillow theirs are extremely flat.
5480795,167747388,2017-07-07,66217885,Ed,Excellent value for SF great location
64165,156711280,2017-05-31,573102,Vladimir,"This place is just awesome and I would highly recommend it to anyone. In terms of cost to value this is probably the best place to stay in that area. I stayed there for business but enjoyed it a lot.

The location is terrific very quiet and peaceful but with Valentino's market just around the corner and Union St with a lot of restaurants shops and the lively crowd just a block away. What I especially liked is that it is not a typical touristic place. You will feel yourself like a local there. 

The room is also great nicely decorated and very clean. I didn't use various amenities a lot but you would find there everything you need for an extended stay. There was no single thing I missed. 

Regina is the great host very friendly and attentive. If you are looking for a place to stay in SF for a while don't miss this one. "
137546,114338383,2016-11-17,28278428,Willy,"Scott's place is amazing! We all know how expensive San Francisco could be... But for that price is extremely difficult to find another place bigger cleaner with huge spaces good location & awesome details.
We didn't have the chance to meet Scott personally but he was always answering our questions right away & in a very helpful way.
The house is lovely & Scott has very good taste!
Because all these we will say 51 Virginia Ave is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone visiting San Francisco.
Thanks again! Thanks always!"
1392204,340390677,2018-10-23,36191951,John & Rose,"Dee was a very accommodating and friendly Host. this location was perfect for our trip.

Fun history about the property also made for fun conversation

Highly recommend. .

8352275,131571541,2017-02-12,47121693,Cathi,The Cozy Room is just that and we totally enjoyed our stay. The spot is perfect for dining by the ocean at the Cliff House or the Beach Chalet!  We would definitely stay with this host again!
14691164,280659079,2018-06-23,180793591,Ty,Good location. Nice city view. Nice quiet place.

9197404,110556798,2016-10-27,7143138,Amelie,We enjoyed our stay with Shawna very much! She gave us great tips on what's nearby and provided everything we needed. It felt like our second home especially when there were cute kitties around the place to keep us company when Shawna wasn't at home! Location was perfect to explore the vibrant Mission street area plus it's close to the BART station too. Won't hesitate to stay here again if we return to SF in the future! :) 
23615779,288458970,2018-07-09,40318299,Nicole,Xin's place is an excellent value in San Francisco!  We needed to be close to SFSU for an early morning registration and it was perfect - just minutes away.  Quiet neighborhood parking space a real plus - overall great stay!
10369307,108618298,2016-10-16,57083228,Khrystyna,Place is nice comfortable and well equipped. We enjoyed our stay there! 
9435665,140774958,2017-03-31,111905248,Hanspeter,"Das Haus ist sehr schön und gepflegt. Man fühlt sich sofort zuhause. Leider haben wir Maria nicht persönlich getroffen da sie abwesend war. Bei voller Belegung mit 3 Parteien ist ein einziges Bad mit Toilette eindeutig eine Herausforderung. Obwohl der Endpreis mit 120$ pro Nacht nicht günstig ist können wir die Unterkunft sehr empfehlen.

Bei kühlem Wetter empfiehlt sich das erste Zimmer rechts im oberen Stock zu nehmen da im anderen Raum das Bett direkt unter dem undichten Fenster steht."
748222,153097642,2017-05-19,16690206,唐灵轩Ever,Thank you Yesica for the great tips for going around and being nice and helpful during our stay! The mattress is very comfortable. And the bathroom is also very clean. 
746079,67414839,2016-03-29,11815499,Tim And Lily,You ought to stay here. Previous reviewers are accurate in their positive reviews. The location is superb the apartment is quiet and Ian is a great host. We were greeted by a glass of water and conversation about great things to see in SF. Your own private access is a great addition. Stay here and you won't be disappointed! We had a wonderful time! 
27780282,403775497,2019-01-21,35341149,Dan,We travel to the Bay Area from time to time and over the years have become less interested in staying in some areas of the City. Ocean Beach is not one of those places. We love it there. Adrienne and Blaise’s place is charming and clean and within a short walk of anything you need including a great food market with locally sourced produce a few bars and great food. Highly recommend!

12 min du métro avec bus sur le trajet si nécessaire et 5 minutes des commerces 
Judy est une hôte agréable soucieuse de bien nous accueillir ce qui est rare aux États Unis où les hôtes font le job mais pourraient y mettre plus de cœur.
Judy sait aussi trouver la juste distance avec ses locataires."

20424404,459777593,2019-05-27,26912975,Sibille,Very nice flat in cool bernal height! Especially for a family with kids its a perfect place. We liked to have dinner in the exelent restaurant nearby and to go around we took uber what was very easy..
3812931,499563233,2019-07-31,76456770,Lenna,Very nice place in a great location. The neighbourhood is nice and it’s a quick walk to the mission or the baseball park if you want. The place is very clean nice and cozy and the porch is the perfect place to unwind and read.

561602,21822715,2014-10-25,9982659,Lou,"We had spent a wonderful week in San Francisco in Matthew's house.
Matthew was welcoming and discret at the same time. After collecting us from the train station he took us to his home.  He took the time to give us a detailed description of the city's layout and its neighborhoods. We got our own floor with a very nice view. The house is very clean. The location is perfect: very nice neighborhoods several bus and the BART (train) to go where you want inside the city. I really enjoyed to spend a bit of time with Matthew trying to understand baseball rules (go Giants! :)). On our last day Matthew took us to the airport which was much appreciated. We highly recommend Matthew as host."
616517,135342268,2017-03-04,676235,Scott,Steven is a very gracious host. Took the time to walk me through the house and answer any question. He was always available and responsive to texts. The home was very quiet although literally steps to restaurants and nightlife. 
1687330,25069744,2015-01-05,19703987,Tom,Jon and Christine's apartment was perfect for us.  Quiet plenty of room for the 4 of us and well stocked with blankets pillows etc...  Entry was simple great neighborhood right between the Presidio and Golden Gate Park and a house book that detailed everything one could possibly want to eat in the area.  Gotta love The City especially when you can escape when its time to go to sleep!!
23700802,353123845,2018-11-26,1627991,Harry,Irene's place in the Outer Sunset was perfect for our family's stay. It's a short walk to the park and 10-15min walk to restaurants/coffee shops and Ocean Beach. The space was clean well equipped and the balcony had beautiful ocean views (weather permitting). Communication was great. Would definitely stay here again.
26572144,311236806,2018-08-20,28064790,Lesley,The Red Victorian is amazing and a great way to experience San Francisco right in the center of the Haight Ashbury neighborhood.  I met travelers from all over the world while staying here for a weekend and enjoyed the hospitality of the residents of the house.  The place is creative and funky and also clean.  There was a fun (but loud) party on Saturday night and I had to wake up early but I magically found earplugs in one of the public areas of the house and slept like a baby.  The room (Flower Child) was perfect.    I will be back for sure next time I am in San Francisco.  
26303324,529353686,2019-09-14,286320092,Ikram,Not great place to stay. It's little far from the downtown or major tourist attractions. Also very difficult to get the parking if you need one.
23326161,468570135,2019-06-12,22579775,Terence,We stayed here for 2 nights while on vacation in San Francisco.  It was extremely clean.  The space was exactly as advertised the Wifi was fast and we enjoyed 2 nights of rest there.  Check in was super easy and we had no issues finding the place or checking in.  The location was very good within walking distance of several restaurants and points of interest.  We also found the nearby bus lines to be very easy to get to and close by.   Our hosts were super nice responded to our questions very quickly and made everything very easy.  We would definitely stay here again.
7902889,50891572,2015-10-15,26008249,Cameron,Michael was a very considerate host.  His loft was tidy and the fold out was surprisingly comfortable.  His place is very well located and I would highly recommend this accommodation for anyone with a busy itinerary. 
19039703,167174287,2017-07-05,82395131,Abby,Some coworkers and I stayed here for a two-day visit to San Francisco over the 4th of July weekend. It has a great location being close to the Golden Gate Park and Bridge! Parking is a pain so if you are wanting to be closer to the piers then I would recommend staying somewhere else because Ubers/Lyft can become a bit expensive depending how often you use it/how long your stay is. Overall the stay was great. I never met the host though so I cannot speak if Sandy was kind or not. Her father was great! 
848578,98927702,2016-09-02,47952210,Alexander,"Everything was as expected. The rooms are simple but the kitchen and the living room are lovely. You can easily park your car on the street and it's not far to San Francisco city.

The contact to Delores was good and she answered every question immediately."
6688004,329789943,2018-09-29,56058580,Patricia,Had a great stay at Linda's home recently. My room was cosy comfortable clean and well equipped. The bed was comfy and I always got a good nights sleep.  Nice breakfast everyday. Linda is a great host and I would recommend her home to anyone visiting San Francisco.
18126981,348667510,2018-11-14,111811683,Sergey,Budi's place is cozy clean and in convenient location.
23698833,282941286,2018-06-28,75653628,Lindsey,The space is just as described and for the most part great! It’s a nice space but It’s about 20 min outside of the city and not in the best neighborhood. It’s fine during the day but kinda sketchy at night. Also very hard to find at night because there isn’t a visible house number.

7331464,417928190,2019-02-28,138556,Derek,My colleague and I stayed at Susan’s house for four days.  She could not have been a more accommodating host. Her suite is exactly as described and the beds and bathroom are amazing.  Her house is situated a couple of blocks away from a Whole Foods and has easy access to the MUNI.  It’s a great place.
1421774,364542704,2018-12-30,6133295,Leyla,This apartment was clean comfortable and modern set in a charming neighborhood. Vanick was a wonderful host providing us with helpful local recommendations and a smooth check-in and check-out process. I've stayed in several airbnb's in San Francisco and this is the first one I would come back to!
33783113,471008323,2019-06-16,108658624,Christina,Eric was very accommodating and responded very quickly. His house was clean spacious and beautiful overall - definitely as advertised and more! 10/10 would book again.

Location is perfect near the Painted Ladies."
8500048,103883802,2016-09-24,19134362,Estefania,"Brandi's apartment is the perfect unit to visit San Francisco and enjoy the experience and feel of being a local. 

The apartment is very clean and has been designed for comfort and convenience to the fine details. During our recent visit we were two persons each with full suitcases packed for a 10 day trip. We were able to comfortably unpack everything and nothing was in the way. The kitchen is comfortable and perfect for preparing breakfast and snacks. The bed was very comfy and the living area spacious. The bathroom also had a very convenient set up. Apart from the layout the design is very hip and the color scheme is modern and pleasant.

Brandi and her family are very gracious and friendly. They are also great hosts stocking the apartment with snacks Nespresso pods toiletries and other goodies. What we found incredibly helpful were the eating and visiting recommendations. Mixing neighborhood finds and citywide attractions we were able to plan our whole visit around Brandi's recommendations. 

The location of the apartment was very convenient in the Inner Sunset. The apartment is a short walk from the Golden Gate Park where the DeYoung Museum Tea Garden Academy of Sciences and other landmarks and attractions are located. 9th Ave is also great for its variety of good eating spots on the way to the park. Uber rides were always available within a short wait time. 

All in all a great experience and apartment. Would definitely stay here again!

7247351,331464688,2018-10-02,29271455,Liz,Shauna’s place was in a good location. There were restaurants and coffee shops that were within walking distance. The BART was also very close. It’s also a very inexpensive Lyft ride away from the city. It provided a nice home base for our San Francisco sightseeing!
11437138,561522398,2019-11-09,19959934,Fabricio,Maria is a great host. Her house is beautiful and full of good vibes! VERY well located walking distance from Bart (took me 40min from the airport costing $950) the neighborhood is surrounded by nice cafes  cool restaurants pubs and supermarkets. You can also walk to Mission district. Sequoia the dog is so beautiful and friendly. Would definitely come back.
307837,129252623,2017-01-29,23293333,Baykan,I stayed at Ellen's place for 3 weeks and it was amazing! The house was just like in the photos with a beautiful garden and pretty close to cool restaurants and bars in Mission area. Perfect little place for everyone visiting SF!

4902365,226280556,2018-01-09,113035984,Taeyeol,요일별로 호스텔에서 자체적으로 운영하는 이벤트가 있어서 다른 외국인들과 교류할 수 있는 기회가 더 많은 것 같습니다. 위치도 코잇타워 바로 아래쪽이라 너무 좋구요 시설도 꽤 괜찮은 편입니다. 직원들도 너무 친절하구여. 굳이 단점을 뽑자면 침대 이층에서 잘때는 조금 불편해요 ㅋㅋㅋ
1364882,259787144,2018-05-02,43342910,Robert,"A great place to stay in a wonderful part of the city!  The apartment is very quiet and secure.  The area is very safe and there are many shops restaurants and convenience stores within a block or two of the apartment.  We had a car for 10 days and found that on street parking was not a problem.  The apartment is beautifully decorated and very comfortable furnishings TV WiFi etc. were first rate.  The mattress and bedding were the best we have had at any AirBnb (or hotel).  There were plenty of towels sheets etc.  The kitchen is well stocked with everything you could need.  The appliances were very nice.  The backyard was lovely and amazingly private.  The bottle of wine awaiting us upon arrival was much appreciated.  Checkin and checkout was a breeze and Corin responded immediately to our very few questions.

We were there for the entire month of April and everything was perfect.  We will definitely come back to this wonderful place."

Any future guests will be lucky!

11674758,127873794,2017-01-21,9740780,Molly,Staying with Pete definitely felt like home away from home! I came to San Francisco for work-related meetings and I wanted a place that was comfortable centrally located and affordable and Pete's place more than delivered on that. My room was spacious and comfortable; there was ample common space to chat with Pete and meet other guests; and Pete himself makes the whole thing feel like you're a visiting friend. On top of that the apartment is in a really cool and vibrant neighborhood. I was able to walk to some of the best restaurants and shopping in the city easily got to/from SFO and took affordable Ubers to places that were less accessible on public transportation. I also felt pretty safe staying here as a single gal. Definitely recommend for anyone wanting to feel like a local in San Francisco!
34065657,532424481,2019-09-19,238207740,Dominika,Very good localisation ! Nice bedrooms and bathrooms. The living room and it’s convertible sofa could be better though !

3946571,174677538,2017-07-26,108041716,Nuria,La situació de la casa es bona ben comunicada. El carrer és molt tranquil i no hi ha apenes sorrolls. La casa es preciosa i molt ben cuidada amb estil victorià. La habitació és amplia amb molt espai per deixar les coses (armari i calaixera) el llit és molt comode. Tot esta molt net i pulit. L'anfitriona la Lisa és una senyora entranyable es pot parlar d'un munt de coses i per tant la visita resulta molt interesant perquè pots veure si vols altres aspectes de SF. A la casa hi ha un gos Shilom que es carinyos i molt trànquil és adorable... Doncs des d'aqui agrair la seva hospitaliat per haverme obert la seva casa i si torno a SF intentare tornar a casa seva.

11998353,420491704,2019-03-06,45397243,Reina,Jimmy & Maury were excellent hosts. They were super communicative and very accommodating to my travel schedule which fell outside of their normal checkin/out hours which I was very thankful for. The room itself was also more spacious that I anticipated and perfect for two people traveling together. I recommend this spot to anyone looking for a beautiful place in a perfect location.

The house is lovely.  It is well maintained and sympathetically modernized in keeping with its historic context.  The bedroom is spacious and the bed is excellent.

The best thing is often kept to the last. Lisa is a wonderful host always helpful and very considerate.  Her breakfasts are really special and we enjoyed our chats Lisa.

The private suite is very comfortable and the flat is located in a very convenient part of San Francisco and public transportation. I rented a car so I was very happy to have a place to park every day. The bathroom has an awesome shower and the bedroom and living rooms have spectacular views of the city. The kitchen has filtered water and other nice amenities. I enjoyed visiting with John and Mr. Finch was so fun to play with. I plan to return the next time I'm staying in San Francisco!
15478431,439317744,2019-04-18,213594515,Matt,Fun and unique experience on this sailboat. Seagulls and sea lions are the neighbors and not as noisy as I would have thought right off Pier 39. Much more relaxing than your typical house/hotel.
6453774,309090072,2018-08-17,8632113,Peter,The Donatello is a very nice hotel communication was prompt and check-in was very easy. The rooms are very comfortable with all the amenities you'd need.

13749078,83745592,2016-07-04,66199755,Monica,We had such a good time here. Honestly the room was just as described and even better everything was brand new! There are children and dogs(all adorable) but if you're looking to take advantage of the day this is a really cool space. I would definitely recommend this room for groups of 4. Spacious clean and with your own bathroom. Everyone in the house is friendly and it's possible to come and go as you please.
905399,3597570,2013-02-20,4084272,Tanya,The location is terrific for enjoying everything this vibrant neighborhood has to offer; the flat is clean and comfortable; and Nancy epitomizes what an AirBnB host should be: Fun knowledgeable (she's a local merchant so she has the inside scoop on her hood) and welcoming. I felt very comfortable in her home like I was staying with an old friend.

760794,422672494,2019-03-11,23999314,Fiona,"Evelyn’s place was amazing. It is one of those places that makes you really appreciate Airbnb. It really gave us an opportunity to experience a wonderful slice of SF. Glen park is a very cute neighborhood with everything you could want within walking distance. The bart station was an easy walk. But most of all the view was amazing. 

Her place is stylish but also very homely and easy to relax in. 

We would definitely stay again."
27025,170646,2011-01-15,283528,Catherine,"Luis was a great host responding quickly to any request.  My friend had a bad knee and could barely walk by the end of our stay. He drove us to the hotel near the airport we had to get to for a workshop we were attending 
before our flight home.  We had a very comfortable stay in ""our home away from home"". Definitely would stay with Luis on any future visit to San Francisco."
130805,93670582,2016-08-13,51782112,Kevin,I stayed here for 8 weeks and absolutely loved the spot. Sue and Mike are wonderful hosts. Sue helped us to move in and was always available to answer any questions via text. The space itself is just how it is displayed in the pictures. The kitchen is fully stocked and worked really well for me to save money on food during my time. My favorite thing about this house was its' location. It is located just 10 houses down from Valencia Street which has lots of great restaurants bars coffee shops  and interesting retail/antique stores. Just a short walk in the other direction takes you to the beautiful Dolores Park which was maybe my favorite spot in the whole city. The 24th St. BART Station is close by and makes traveling into the city easy. Overall i really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend staying with Sue and Mike to anyone!

30469161,461014694,2019-05-30,89249080,Natalie,"Janelle's place was perfect for what we needed. We didn't want to drive in the city so parked at Janelle's and took public transport to the city center. 
The room is small but has everything you need when you're busy exploring a city. The bathroom especially was much nicer than anticipated. 
Janelle is a great host keeping in touch and making sure everything is ok. 
You can hear a lot of noise upstairs and I'm not sure if it is a washing machine or what it is but at times something sounds like it could fall through! ;) It wasn't a problem and late at night it was quiet enough to sleep."
21187925,266938555,2018-05-20,19840844,Zachary,Jorge's place was convenient with a nice view of the city.  Everything was clean and Jorge was very responsive.  As Jorge notes in his description the family lives up stairs so you hear the foot steps of their kids in the morning but otherwise the place is quit.
2189514,12788487,2014-05-11,291632,Victor,"Melise’s apartment truly is a home away from home… My wife and I were celebrating our birthdays and anniversary in San Francisco so we wanted everything to be perfect. Right from the start it surpassed all our expectations.  We had a very late arrival as our plane was delayed but Melise was so sweet she waited up for us despite the hour and helped us settle in.

This lovely apartment is perfect not even the smallest detail was overlooked.  There were treats in the kitchen waiting for us when we arrived which were greatly appreciated fresh flowers set on the table a current “Where to Go” guide to the city…we felt pampered and very welcome.  Needless to say everything was fresh and clean the bed is super comfortable truly a delight to stay in.

Melise is a delightful host she is such a lovely person going out of her way to make us feel comfortable and at home.  She gave us tips and recommendations for dining out and getting around the city and even surprised us with extra treats on our birthday!

We spent the most incredible 10 days in San Francisco mostly because we had such a lovely place to call “home” while we were there.  We are already planning a return trip to San Francisco with our son and will definitely look nowhere else to stay but here!

From the bottom of our hearts GRACIAS!  See you soon Melise!!!  Vic & Coral"
4052091,75289840,2016-05-20,3599722,Catalina,Beth and Tom were amazing hosts!!  So welcoming warm and hilarious!!  Beyond my expectations -  I was really lucky they welcomed me in as I had a cold and a long day interviewing so it was great to come back to a relaxing space.  Their home is super tidy but far from sterile modern classic and designed to relax.  Perfect place to call home while in SF!!  Highly highly recommend!!  Thanks guys for your hospitality and hopefully see you soon!! Cheers!
1206233,14819982,2014-06-27,12157571,Miren Itxaso,"Good situation to visit some places as Golden Gate Park o second hand shops in Haigh Street. But it´s far to Fisherma´s Warth or Golden Gate bridge. In my very personal opinion there is a problem with heating. It´s is managed from he hall the same for all the rooms and it´s very difficult to get an agreement with other people you don´t know about the temperature. Someone in the night get it on and form me was difficult to sleep because was very warm and noisy. 
An inconvenient is to share one toilet for five rooms. "
8859249,78390641,2016-06-06,7015033,Phillip,"Erika and Gary were really gracious and thoughtful with their awesome listing! The location is exactly as described with ample street parking (literally NO problems and none of that ""2 hour"" SF issue). I sincerely recommend this unit to anyone that likes a quite local location!"
11911651,466950874,2019-06-09,262306129,Ben,Great views great location - plenty of restaurants cafes and bars close or relatively close by.  Hosts are gracious accommodating thoughtful respectful and prompt.
25728058,299305826,2018-07-30,99887042,Ellie,Andrew went out of his way to help us with our arrival and check-in and communicated with us throughout our stay. However some amenities were not as listed (especially parking) and cleanliness was mediocre. 
11549175,112633321,2016-11-06,61570497,Blanca,Great location and good neighborhood. Host was willing to meet us upon a late arrival. The house sleeps a large group but it is an older home and there are only two small bathrooms. 
2944843,210141056,2017-11-07,21672822,Bert,Janaf was by far the best and warmest host we had in our b&b carrier. She did everything to make our stay wonderful. Highly recommended.
647360,38814207,2015-07-19,23839127,Charlie,"Our stay at Merced Manor was an extraordinary experience. The apartment is beyond expectations trust me. Eric made us feel just like home after a short introduction. Everything is modern and stylish. The kitchen itself is worthwhile to be here.  Equipped with everything to satisfy a ""chef"". And even more there was everything you need for a first breakfast in the fridge. We got some good hints on where to go and where to eat. The backyard is such a cosy and relaxing place. We do not only recommend this place but will definitely stay here on our next trip to SFO. Thanks Eric and Peter you made our stay a special one."
11464408,77956971,2016-06-04,19783690,Chelsea,Ulysses's place was conveniently located with plenty of street parking and easy access to the MUNI and BART. He was very nice to accommodate us with an early check in and very responsive to our needs. I really appreciated the visitor information guide that he has compiled and we definitely took his suggestion to make the 7 minute walk to El Farolito.  The mattress is old and has a dip in one side but overall great experience. 
13127954,503333614,2019-08-05,276106470,Ellie,Pankaj and Sarahs home was stunning we stayed in the Moroccan room which was newly renovated and gave off a luxurious and homely feel (with the softest sheets I’ve ever felt). The house is truely beautiful and has everything you need for a comfortable stay ( breakfast coffee and views for days). I would highly recommend this house for a memorable trip to the centre of San Francisco !
1767543,16600554,2014-07-30,11394896,Helmut,Russ was really accomodating when we asked him to change our reservation just a few days before our arrival. We were a group of 4 people and stayed in San Francisco for only 2 nights. Russ was very nice and we found the appartement easily. Also the door codes made it easy to get inside. The appartement was very clean and friendly. We can totally recommend to stay there if you don't need a kitchen.
786492,228426096,2018-01-19,7337141,Katherine,Great place. Clean and comfy.

273530,210469273,2017-11-09,115569988,Eddie,The potrero nest offers exceptional views of the city and quiet and peaceful place to get rest. Lovely place to stay when visiting San Francisco.
752607,28467565,2015-03-24,26325367,Zac,Everything was as expected. Lily was responsive and good host.

5196399,27721623,2015-03-10,19309020,Alex,Duncan and Zain are great very friendly and accommodating. The place was in a great location in the mission lots of delicious local food and a short walk to BART and busses into SOMA.

16219958,233054868,2018-02-07,123498733,Anzhalika,Great place! Clean comfy has full kitchen and everything you need there. Walking distance to Golden gate park ocean and Presidio park. Quiet neighborhood. The host is very welcoming  and responsive. I highly recommend.
424846,438077738,2019-04-15,41816879,Cindy,Martha and Jim were very accommodating when we needed to arrive late. We were able to contact them whenever we needed but also felt we had a very private suite...two floors! They were eager to help and give tips and places of interest. Their home was also located in a very convenient place for our needs and was clean and lovely. Recommended!
23173614,261626505,2018-05-06,114893989,Blair,BrillIant place really clean great check-in/ out experience.
8474183,102063853,2016-09-16,68447112,Cathy,Jonathan was welcoming even though we met him first on day 2. His directions for finding the apartment were accurate and detailed. We were happy with the apartment and location. Everything was as we expected clean quiet small and cosy.

7073115,210133143,2017-11-07,151306331,John,"Issac’s home is in a beautiful quiet neighborhood of Lake Merced/San Francisco. The private room is perfect for the single traveler or couple. Close by to San Francisco State Collage. A short walk to Muni and UBER comes right to your doorstep.
The room is extremely clean and so appreciated the thoughtful touches that Doug and Issac did(snack trayrefrigerator with chilled glasses and beverages and very good lighting."
59344,14113177,2014-06-12,12952060,Tommy,What an enjoyable experience we had here. The place was perfect in description and location. Immaculate throughout. John was very helpful and he and his wife were very welcoming. Max the cat was always welcome during the mornings for a visit. Such a good kitty!! Public transportation options were plentiful and we were able to get to most places of interest quickly.  Would highly recommend this place and would happily stay again the next time we visit the city. 
16242493,151655138,2017-05-13,6704674,Justin,Jessy was a great host.  Comfy bed clean (and spacious) place.  The room was indeed sunny. :) Thank you!
21558062,362176650,2018-12-25,62283663,Marina,Andrew is a very responsive and understanding host. His place had everything you would need for a good stay. He was very accommodating to a change in my schedule and earlier departure. Since I was staying over Christmas I appreciated the box of chocolates and a kind note for the holidays. Highly recommended.
4052091,532943724,2019-09-20,139502008,Leanne,"Beautiful home a few minutes walk to the Painted Ladies and a 10-15 minute Uber to fisherman’s Wharf. 
Beth and Tom are super friendly easy going and made us feel very comfortable in their home. Beth went above and beyond to provide tips both in San Francisco and to our next destination in Sonoma.
The bedroom is very comfortable with cable TV a large mirror which is great for getting ready and next door was our private bathroom with a good size walk in shower.
Plenty of windows for warm nights you will hear cars and people go by but that’s to be expected in a big city. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
5480795,55295688,2015-11-29,29685084,Justina,I stayed here with my brother and sisters for two nights. The room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the location of the place and had a great time. The staff was wonderful and pleasant to talk to. We would definitely stay here again.
13585679,185102071,2017-08-20,1749776,Lara,Perfect place to discover SF! Super cozy and well design! We will come back for sure
8763529,409105644,2019-02-06,4110228,Hrvoje,Good location and very affordable Zain and Duncan communicated everything effectively. Overall it was as expected I would have appreciated a bit cleaner environment and a bit more of heating but overall it was close to expectations. Finally I met nice crowd there.
21252479,226434851,2018-01-10,25337663,Kingsley,5 Star host.  Highly recommended. Perfect hospitality
33783996,486500282,2019-07-12,164817,Kaelin,Beautiful home in a good neighbourhood with easy access to all the Bay Area has to offer! Francesca is a great host!
63247,208772024,2017-11-03,55438435,Alexandra,The experience with Federico was absolutely amazing from the very beginning he was so kind and personable. He took the time to get to know you prior to the demonstration and was so enthusiastic about his work his life and so intrigued by his guests lives as well. He creates stunning one of a kind Jewlery that you truly would never find anywhere else. After the experience he brought us to a Fresco and treated us to an aperitif of drinks and delicious snacks. I am studying abroad in Florence so I was lucky enough to have a one of a kind/handmade ring made by Federico following the experience - he took his time and communicated with me via (Hidden by Airbnb) about the ring. The ring turned out absolutely stunning he truly went above and beyond my expectations. By far my favorite air bnb experience I’ve ever participated in! Grazie a Federico!!!
11939561,163983112,2017-06-25,51663084,Susie,Great location and quiet! Steps away from Bart and restaurants. Tiffany was a great host and offered some excellent suggestions for the area! I would book again in a heartbeat.
3309722,448087089,2019-05-04,154261762,Andrew,Great place! Loved the neighborhood and view!  Will stay again next time I’m in San Francisco!
3081324,14359442,2014-06-17,15450518,Lindy,Bernal marina home was a perfect home for the size family we had! Everyone had a bedroom with their own bathrooms.  Kid or adults could go to the basement to watch the tv without it being the center if attention. Kitchen and dining room were a fabulous size for those who wanted and needed to cook and for those who wanted to eat. Laundry facilities were on site and grocery stores or coffee shops were very near! Highly recommended! 
11437138,536466776,2019-09-26,77561618,Bojan,The place is sparkling clean located 5 min on foot from public transportation stops and the Market streer. The host Maria is great. She provided me with a lot of information beforehand about the city where to eat and much more (definitely recommend reading through it since it will probably answer 99% of the qiestions you might have). Would stay here again
3112427,46130168,2015-09-08,36381952,Tommy,Beautiful studio apartment in Outer Sunset. Very peaceful and quiet neighborhood but just a short walk to the water shops cafes and public transportation. A great find and a lovely stay. Wish we had used the cute backyard more but we were on the go most of our visit. Would definitely stay again.
748256,31631185,2015-05-08,14759142,Anne Sophie,"Very good times with them. Nice room nera a metro and bus stop. They are very nice. 
Thank you both! "
31668263,428222225,2019-03-24,17757954,David,Lovely apartment in a great location. Smooth check-in and out. Excellent communications from the host. Would highly recommend for either business or pleasure!
18737830,422697521,2019-03-11,236713094,Brett,Great place to stay. Host is very helpful and the spot is in a great spot to explore the Mission.
905399,51600083,2015-10-21,23263766,Marc,Nancy was a perfect host. Very nice and helpful she gave us good advices and help us to park our car for free (which is not that easy in S.F.). We would come back for sure if we had the opportunity
16255081,151227299,2017-05-11,37611129,Tim,Very spartan but if all you need is a bed and a shower (and WiFi of course) this place is great. Easy to get to check-in and check-out. When traveling on a budget alone again I'll likely come back.
2538807,82663878,2016-06-28,21130583,Lindsay,Phil's place had everything we needed. Location is great - less than 5 mins to the Muni station with direct lines to downtown. Would stay there again.
2770561,96019802,2016-08-21,58887118,Kelsey,I really enjoyed the location and the front yard.  Sitting on the deck chairs and taking in the sun.   I really missed the Bay area and it felt very comfortable to be there.    Raman and Z seemed very friendly but we weren't able to connect for too long due to everyone's busy schedule but seemed very personable people.  
769734,46349463,2015-09-09,294964,David,Also my second time at Annie's place was awesome and I can still recommend it.
1578597,17626528,2014-08-15,759065,Armin,"Jon-Pierre's place is excellent. Although it's only a studio it feels super roomy it has a lot of natural light and it's very nicely and considerately decorated. The room was spotless. Bed was very comfortable. Wifi was strong. There is a sliver of an outside patio with a table and chairs that looks into the ocean and that was a nice treat after being in an airplane all morning. There is a small deli/grocery store on the other side of the street a few doors up that is very handy for snacks or a sandwich. There is also a Whole Foods three blocks down and by ""down"" I mean DOWN really steep hill. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. 

Bonus landmark: The poor man's Lombard Street — Vermont St — is 3 blocks away! (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
19364007,276752807,2018-06-14,55355770,Jiahui,A great location and cute room for short staying in San Francisco. Geoffrey and Rich replied quickly and the communication was great. They were very considerate to accommodate me. Definitely a recommendation for staying in SF!
1466344,168956654,2017-07-10,104197310,Ishan,Really enjoyed my stay here location was perfect and Sylvia was very helpful with any questions I had. 
5299461,434854373,2019-04-08,212227035,Nico,Zain wasn't only a great host but became a great friend.
15412358,552537552,2019-10-21,102558627,Jesse,"Nicely located and comfortable place. My wife young child and dog stayed here for a few weeks when we first moved to SF. It worked very well for our purposes. 

Quiet block a short walk away from the heart of Noe Valley - good access to stores and restaurants. On a convenient bus line. 

Bernat the host was very responsive when the internet went down (no fault of his - problem was with Comcast). 

The neighbors upstairs were friendly though the floors were thin so you could hear their dogs running around. It didn’t bother us at all but if you’re super sensitive to sound it would be worth considering. 

Kitchen could have used a few more knives and other stuff but was otherwise clean and appliances were modern and in great shape. 

Overall good experience and would recommend it."
21790140,552920977,2019-10-22,2267159,Virginia,Neighborhood has convenient breakfast spots public transit. Place was clean and easy to get into. Bed was comfortable.
17622881,238394933,2018-02-25,117686433,Annabelle,Such a nice place! Kyle was really friendly and helpful and responded to any questions I had really quickly! As someone from overseas the place really made us feel comftorble. Highly reccomend!!
9186305,61375867,2016-02-03,544239,Stephanie,My stay at Clifton and Tom's was absolutely perfect! They were consummate hosts–super kind even accommodating a late night check-in on a Saturday night! I cannot say enough about the space it is immaculate spotless artfully and thoughtfully decorated with an amazing view that I enjoyed each morning with a cup (or several) of gourmet coffee fresh fruit and yogurt. They were super warm and we enjoyed several lively conversations but they were also mindful of my privacy leaving me to gossip on the phone with a friend at the end of a long day. Ideal location next door to the park super close walking distance to Whole Foods endless great restaurants and cafes shopping people watching Golden Gate Park (and the beautiful Conservatory of Flowers) the infamous Haight Ashbury and public transportation. I would without a doubt book this space on my next adventure in SFO! Ten stars!!!
6092596,66759627,2016-03-24,2465522,Cesario,Great little place very clean and convenient. Perfect location and all in good order. We just missed a full kitchen and a little more space.
6365190,145306451,2017-04-17,46108697,Eduardo,Great value Chan was very hospitable.
15132100,127062156,2017-01-15,31246511,Lauren,Great location and accommodating for early check-in! 
837045,156244829,2017-05-29,10111020,Rona,We had a great stay here. It's a very comfortable home and is close to coffee shops and restaurants and public transportation. I highly recommend staying here. 
9010937,345245892,2018-11-04,44892788,Jessica,Fiona’s home is absolutely gorgeous - beautiful decor spacious comfortable and clean! The location is great right in the heart of the Mission close to countless restaurants/bars. Fiona was very communicative and hospitable. I would definitely recommend and would happily stay again!
17222602,280213274,2018-06-22,51796363,Marie-Ange,L'appartement de Tony est situé dans l'immeuble AVA sur la 9ème Rue. Ava est  très sécurisé (clé magnétique pour entrer et prendre les ascenseurs) proche de la station de métro (Bart) et de 'The Market' (adresse : 1355 sur Market Street) un endroit très branché pour faire ses courses et manger. L'appartement se divise en 3 parties (en surfaces presque égales) : un lieu commun (cuisine/salon avec télé) et 2 chambres avec chacune son coin privé pour les wc/salle d'eau. Au rez-de-chaussée de l'immeuble on trouve un grand lobby très cosy pour discuter auprès d'un café/thé acheté au Paramo Café (situé lui aussi au rdc d'Ava). Au deuxième étage une salle de sport vous attend avec plein de machine de musculation.
11418638,146159480,2017-04-21,11828188,Vivek,Rina and Michaels place was perfect for my quick work trip to SF. The location (Bernal Heights) is nice and quiet while still being pretty close to some great places to check out. Rina was also especially helpful when I let her know I'd forgotten some items at home. She quickly brought some replacements which made trip much better and less stressful. I totally recommend this home for anyone visiting the Bay Area!
958,332582581,2018-10-05,79626329,Jon,"The location of this space is fantastic. Go left out the door and you are literally next to Duboce Park and the Muni N Judah train which takes you downtown in 15 minutes or to Sunset/Ocean Beach in half an hour. Go right and you've got Haight and a plethora of places to eat and drink. Castro is 10 mins walk away. As a returning guest to SF the space couldn't have been better located. The flat itself is spacious and modern and bright with doors out on to a patio/garden that caught the sun all day. All amenities provided - including a lovely deep bath coffee in fridge books guides tea etc. 

The only very slight negative I would mention is that you are underneath the family home so you do hear a lot of noise during the day. So if like us you like to have a power nap in the late afternoon before going back out in the evening be prepared for footfall and what sounded like piano lessons! But this is probably not a concern for most - just us lazy bones who needed a lie-down around 4/5pm! Don't let it put you off. A fabulous place to stay and I would go back in a heartbeat."
4387067,446542147,2019-05-01,20520853,Emeline,"Very nice airbnb to discover San francisco. The room was very amazing very well decorated and huge bathroom:)
Perfect neighboroud to have a drink or grab some lovely food !!  
We really enjoyed our stay there."
9063798,283874933,2018-06-30,103915084,Abby,Great location for wanting to be in the city but not in heavy tourist zones. Easy transport to local attractions. Very clean and nicely decorated. I highly recommend this place I would definitely stay here again!
216064,263235747,2018-05-11,156965937,Kevin,I had an exceptional experience on my History of the French Revolution and Napoleon tour with Benjamin. The tour goes by the settings for some of the most dramatic parts of the French Revolution and Benjamin does an excellent job of bringing those characters and events to life. From showing cannon blasts in the side of a church to taking you a cafe to get drinks where Voltaire Robespierre and Thomas Jefferson once frequented you’ll feel like you’re there. 
29992190,422730959,2019-03-11,90677264,Jeroen,Great place for real people. Hardest thing: finding out what goes in which recycle container (very confusing for a European sorry Dave). Lovely rooms really felt like home. Just what I was looking for since I came to SanFran for an intense training. Plus: you don't have to bring your own furry pictures. Wel equipped kitchen gret neighbourhood two great supermarkets just 2' walk (Wallgreens & Gus's). Great connection to downtown etc through metro N just around the corner. Want to buy my own room there - can we talk about that? Love JB.
191632,234940026,2018-02-14,146529446,Juracy,Muito recomendado. Lugar bacana com vários detalhes para aumentar o conforto.
17534666,251892923,2018-04-08,391707,Nora,La maison est dans un quartier un peu excentré mais sympathique et très proche d'un arrêt de tram très pratique. La colocation est très bien organisée et l'accueil est agréable et clair. La chambre est spacieuse et bien équipée. Le jardin est grand on peut y prendre le soleil en compagnie des poules! En prime les différent.e.s colocataires sont très intéressant.e.s et donnent de super conseils pour les visites restos etc.
21836601,264810946,2018-05-14,3305945,Owain,"This is a great place to stay in San Francisco. We stayed here for a week on the last leg of our honeymoon. It bscame our little home away from home. 

It’s a very comfortable and stylish place to relax after a full day in the city. It’s easy to get to downtown just a few stops on the tram or bus. Or you can walk to a couple of very vibrant and trendy districts... right on your doorstep! The Neighbourhood is very tidy and safe. 

Debbie was very efficient in communicating with us and there was no issue at all with entering or exiting the property."
10528294,71485686,2016-04-25,2811884,Jill,We were made to feel so welcome in the mission. Adrienne and Paulo were exceptionally good hosts. They were friendly helpful and made us feel right at home. The room was just as described with sunny bay windows and even a view. it was great to have access tomthe sitting room next door tomour room when we needed it. They gave us good access to coffee and treats in the kitchen as well. Very interesting people to talk to and also knew when to give us our space. Wifi was very good. 
13022499,92955613,2016-08-10,45917559,Yun Ju,My friend and I had the best experience at Peihong's place. She is really professional at hosting guests. The house is exceptionally clean and offers plenty of amenities including food and drinks. She is kind enough to always ask you if you need anything and if you are having a good time. The location is awesome because the bus stop is only about 5 minute walk and the bus usually goes to everywhere in SF.  On the last day we almost missed the flight because we had trouble with uber at last moment but Peihong was generous enough to provide us ride to the airport. Therefore we safely made to our flight. We would love to visit here again next time. Strongly recommend!
22638675,505066949,2019-08-08,261003500,Charlotte,The house is set on a hill top beautiful view immaculately clean newly renovated.  Lots of light enhanced space!  Quiet and convenient.  A  pleasure to stay thank you!

15215678,442569184,2019-04-23,191285761,Cole,Nice place to stay at while visiting San Francisco. Had amazing amenities.
1525137,27462807,2015-03-05,26500414,Ann,Dion made us feel most welcome which included a box of delicious treats from the bakery down the street . The apartment was exactly as described and the neighborhood perfect for getting around town. I would book Dion's place without hesitation--it was a fantastic first experience using Airbnb.
18754189,523889168,2019-09-04,55012064,Mario,Our stay was ok. In the apartment there is everything you need.By car you can reach the centre in 25minutes.Tks !
273530,193757877,2017-09-14,1990221,Andrew,"Top of the hill with amazing views from the patio.  Loved waking up in the morning with the city view out our window.   Very quiet neighborhood.   Perfect layout for us 2 couples.  No problems finding street parking.   Easy/cheap access to the city via Über/Lyft.  The Plow for breakfast was a highlight of our many meals in SF.  Cathryn was a great host.   Our next trip to SF we will definitely be back to ""The Nest""."
1925714,513607237,2019-08-19,7828030,Sarah,Gorgeous place in a highly convenient location. A one-of-a-kind spot that was a private oasis in San Francisco. It was perfect for my stay.
2488520,108300283,2016-10-15,39241694,Jess,"It was great staying in Gabe's loft everything was so straight forward. He had sent me the code for the doors previously so I was in very quickly when I rocked up.

The loft is a great size and perfect for that bit more space when you're travelling.

Gabe had sent a list of bars restaurants and market all within a block which was handy. 

I would stay here again. "
5536512,352113909,2018-11-24,12668969,Philip,We had a fantastic stay with Ken and Mark. They know the city inside out and gave us amazing tips and advice. They are generous and warm hosts. Its a great home in a great location and would totally recommend it!
7275084,293145497,2018-07-19,26556506,Flora,We had a really great time at Meredith and Jeff's place. Everything was perfect! Their house is nice and cosy with everything you need and it's super clean. It is also very well located close to Castro Street Mission Haight Ashbury (all accessible within walking distance) and you can travel to other parts of the city very easily with public transportation. Meredith and Jeff are really lovely and welcoming they gave us many tips and recommendations about the city and breakfast every morning was just amazing! Also they didn't mind us arriving quite late in the evening. We highly recommend and we'll be back for sure if we ever visit SF again!
30175141,548480615,2019-10-17,279301247,Ashley,Stylish relaxing beautiful garden patio- all included and amazing!
20286716,197762997,2017-09-26,147410134,Chris,This is a great house to rent. Very quiet neighborhood nice to relax when you get back from being out all day seeing sites or traveling. I enjoyed staying here and will stay here again.
585225,5412676,2013-06-29,317095,Emily,Great space! We enjoyed staying here and were very comfortable. Be careful if you need to be somewhere at a certain time in the AM b/c traffic in San Francisco can be quite terrible. Be careful where you park. Street parking is easy to find but be sure to read all the signs on your street to make sure you don't get a ticket in the AM during street cleaning times. We found an awesome place to eat breakfast a short walk away and enjoyed being in 'real San Francisco' instead of just the touristy part. Access to the washer/dryer was very helpful. Gabe consistently communicates and answers questions quickly. All in all - a perfect place to stay! Also - if driving when you do drive down to the water use (Website hidden by Airbnb)   We were able to park each day for either $15 or $8 for the whole day depending on what time we entered the lot.

19478755,244457146,2018-03-18,176140389,Guadalupe,"Kathy’s home was absolutely perfect. My friend and I were looking for a location near public transportation while still safe for walking around at night. We got both of those plus so much more at Kathy’s! 
Her home is located near the L line which takes you basically anywhere downtown. She is also near the 28 which takes you to the Gold Gate Bridge. On top of that Kathy offered breakfast every morning (highly recommend it!). I loved her Thai tea so much I got a bag to take back home. 
Neighbor is extremely safe to walk in. As two young girls we can fully attest to that. There’s also a Safeway nearby. 
Lastly I can’t think of any other place with Kathy’s hospitality! She is the sweetest host and very helpful! 

You can’t go wrong here (:"
1984709,315027655,2018-08-27,35178634,Lauren,I stayed an entire month at this studio. It is so beautifully decorated and makes you feel right at home. Robby and Nona manage everything perfectly giving you a warm welcome small attentive details and even weekly cleanings. The studio has everything you might need and more. It is so much better than any hotel. It was a bit cold in the mornings since you don’t want to have the heater on all night so it is best to bring a warm jumper. The neighbourhood was a bit quiet but if you don’t mind that this studio is perfect and superluxurious if you want to explore the city as a tourist. 
748222,12236170,2014-04-27,11936514,Frank,We stayed for four days at Yesica's and Michael's apartment. It was a warm welcome and we felt at home immediately. The description was perfect as well as the very friendly hosts. Especially we enjoyed all the tipps for restaurants biking etc. In case visiting S. F. I would always recommend this apartment and I like to say thank you to both of you  Yesica and Michael. You are the reason we had a unforgettable time in S.F. In case we stay at your town again we would always ask to stay at yours again!!
10578137,205282792,2017-10-21,7987899,Faten,Danna is an incredible host. She was waiting for us when we arrived from the airport and she carefully showed us around the house where little treats were waiting for us (chocolate and water in the rooms breakfast items in the kitchen etc.) When we were cold she replied within a few minutes explaining how to turn the heat on. She checked on us several times during our short trip by Airbnb messaging to see if we needed anything and her son Daniel was available if we needed anything. Her house is as welcoming as its owner: a fully equipped kitchen an outside deck for breakfast or drinks a confortable living room area beautiful bedrooms upstairs. We were 5 adults (no couples) so one of us had to sleep in the tiny bedroom downstairs which has a single bed but is actually quite comfy while another slept in a converted couch (not as comfy as a bad but decent). There's only one bathroom/toilet so it requires some organisation. Finally the house is located in a nice and quiet area near a Whole Foods supermarket and quite close from the center of Mission. We had a great stay and would definitely recommend Danna's house.
4577224,462095742,2019-06-01,227341509,Mo,Location très propre. Le lit est très confortable et grand. Salle de bain très propre. Je la trouve idéalement située à 10mn de la plage et du parc. Au bout de la rue il y a une ligne de métro qui passe. Et pas très loin il y a des petites boutiques des restaurants. Je suis très satisfaite et je recommande. De plus là quartier est calme donc c’est parfait
394575,10368003,2014-02-16,3557752,Harry,Excellent experience.  I have family in Bernal Heights.  This is a terrific neighborhood.  One bus to Market St/Union Sq if you take the # 9.  # 24 takes you to the Castro.  I have gotten to like walking the Cortland St neighborhood.  Also this is an exceptionally clean studio apt.
1944564,514773277,2019-08-21,244556891,Jerin,The area combined with the cozy feeling you get from the apartment make you feel at home. I’ve never slept so well when being away at someone else’s bed. This was one of my top experiences.
3870174,544693662,2019-10-10,242539338,Gerd,"Die Unterkunft liegt nähe Alamo Sqare in einer sehr ruhigen kleinen Seitenstrasse. Es ist an alles gedacht von Kaffemaschine über Wasserkocher bis Kühlschrank. Eine Mikrowelle wäre vielleicht noch ganz schön.
Gleich um die Ecke ist eine Strasse mit vielen Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Restaurants.
Trotz der ruhigen Lage ist alles super schnell zu erreichen mit verschiedenen Buslinien die in unmittelbarer Nähe sind.
Ich kann die Unterkunft uneingeschränkt empfehlen."
33420931,446086849,2019-04-30,61238557,Kjetil,Im disappointed that there was separate bathroom. The window was going to the hallway and not outside creating such bad air quality. This room shouldn’t really qualify for a bedroom. The bed was too big for the room so there were no extra space for moving around. The towels were new but not washed so there were so much lint on the towels. That was uncomfortable. I also didn’t like that there were now cleaning every day in the room. Overall an average stay. The only good thing was Netflix on the tv and the location.
10321776,106967125,2016-10-09,13930985,Ian,Had a great time at this nice quiet location near the beach. Arpita was an excellent host answering questions promptly but allowing plenty of space and privacy. The apartment is as described and shown in the pictures - clean comfortable and spacious.
9471416,329390150,2018-09-28,68594478,Johneen,Great location and very clean house. The bed was very comfortable and l loved all the art. Maria was very responsive to all our requests. great location too!
856123,112047115,2016-11-03,67362100,Silvia,"Mark is more than a Superhost! I felt at home from the get-go. The house and the room were pristine when I got there. Mark is a great cook and will provide plenty of options for breakfast lunch dinner and even snacks (I loved the brownies!).

He has many friends and he would always made sure I was part of his social gatherings. I made many friends this way! He was supportive throughout my stay working hard to make everything to the tee. He helped improve my English and was always there whenever I needed advice. 

The Mission is a really multiethnic district of San Francisco almost small-townish. You will get lost in the myriad restaurants dollar shops Chinese bakeries fruit markets. Mark had advice on different places to try out and about the best areas.

Moving to a new city can be a daunting experience. Mark helped enormously in the transition so I could not recommend his place more!
Thanks Mark xoxoxo

21280829,522161910,2019-09-01,159939706,Ramki,Jane’s place is a stylish classy upscale apartment with great views and nice touches in San Francisco.

16088064,139891323,2017-03-26,63738971,Sarah,What a great location near major city attractions transportation and a Trader Joe's right around the block. We loved the kitchen it was stocked for cooking and the remaining living space was spacious and comfortable. The hosts were very communicative and hospitable. It was a pleasant stay in San Fran! 
6348742,255802534,2018-04-21,111361392,Lilly,Vielen Dank für den tollen Aufenthalt. Es war einfach perfekt. Eine tolle Wohnung in schöner Umgebung ( viele nette Geschäfte und Restaurants in nächster Umgebung Dolores Park in Laufräder) . Das Bett war sehr gemütlich. Wir sind mit unseren zwei Kleinkindern gereist.Die Wohnung war für uns genau richtig. Wir können die Wohnung auf jeden Fall bestens weiter empfehlen.

8763529,257900062,2018-04-27,3026563,Erik,Super nice guys. Genuinely interested in there guests. The place has a good vibe.
10437411,131278145,2017-02-11,53364291,Karla,A great comfortable space. While just a block from the famous Haight Ashbury the neighborhood was quiet at night. There was a lot to do nearby. Golden Gate Park was fantastic.  We were so prepared with the information Chip had given us before we arrived we never had to ask for anything else though I know he would have been happy to help.  Overall great experience.

Toni is warm and welcoming and the comfort of her guests are her priority! 
We look forward to coming back!"
19039703,270920883,2018-05-30,55269233,Brian,Sandy is an awesome host! She made it easy to communicate with and is very nice.The apt is in a great location! Comfy beds! Her place def does the trick when you need a place to lay your head down. 5⭐️!
21766847,505776301,2019-08-09,153909340,Ruth,John is a fantastic host... kind and thoughtful touches like drinks and snacks in the room plus plenty of towels combined with everywhere being spotlessly clean made this an outstanding place to stay.
3780418,408810971,2019-02-05,28814156,Katelyn,Raveevarn's little studio is the perfect affordable home base for 1-2 people in San Francisco and we really enjoyed our stay. She is very sweet and made sure to stop by and say hi on her way through (the entryway to the studio is through her garage). She even stocked our fridge with beverages fresh fruit and yogurt to have on hand for breakfast. The apartment is spotless and decked out with very modern decor. The neighborhood is definitely up-and-coming but we felt very safe and had no problem getting wherever we needed to be.
6688004,62757035,2016-02-16,56828481,Gus,Linda was very accommodating even saving us a parking spot on her street. The bedroom and bathroom is quite private with an adjacent room with our own mini-fridge. We also had access to the kitchen and to a lovely outside patio which we used. Linda was very friendly and helpful making suggestions of places to eat and sights to see. This was our first Airbnb experience and it could not have been much better.
8048653,264792709,2018-05-14,93386966,Elisabeth,This place was quite lovely to stay in - my friend and I stayed in the master suite for 4 nights. It is clean the hosts are hospitable will speak with you and make you feel right at home and are always available and respond quickly. There's a washer/dryer the linens were clean there is soap/shampoo and a hair dryer. They even have a mattress to put on top of the futon which was a nice touch! The unit is in the lower part of the house - with a separate kitchen and two bedrooms. The hosts live in the upper part of the house. If you arrive before check in or need a place to store your luggage after check in they will gladly do that for you. The one issue many reviews touched on is that the walls between the two bedrooms are thin - you can hear a lot of what's going on between the two rooms.  This is true - however we had absolutely no problem with this at all except occasionally hearing some footsteps. However if you are staying with friends and want to blast music into the late hours and have long loud conversations then this place isn't for you as you will disturb the other guests. We had two separate sets of guests stay during our stay and did not hear them once. Also I should mention that this is not super centrally located so you will have to uber or drive to most places. I loved it because you feel a lot more like a local. Overall - nice house neat room/unit cute neighborhood hospitable hosts. Recommend for a great stay in SF!
41423,24774802,2015-01-02,4144014,Mary-Caitlyn,"Our stay at the guest cottage was great! The hosts were helpful when contacted but otherwise gave us total privacy which was just what we wanted. I recommend doing some poking around the cottage when you arrive-- I missed the trash can liners until the last day so we were using a paper bag. Oops! I loved that there were plenty of kitchen utensils so we could save some money by cooking in. There's one window without a curtain which felt a little weird but there didn't seem to be any direct sight lines to the sleeping area so that was ok. The ""bedroom"" window has a GORGEOUS VIEW :-) the place overall is tidy and well-kept even if some of the furniture has some wear and tear on it.
Although there are usually parking spots on the street it's only for 4 hours at a time 9-5. I had been to this neighborhood before so I knew where I could leave my car for longer stretches of time. Guests newer to the neighborhood might need to do more exploring to find these spots so plan ahead.
Super convenient location for taking BART. Big hill to walk up if you are coming back on foot. I think there's a bus you can take to avoid it but it's such a short walk it seems silly to wait for the bus unless it's really difficult for you.
Great experience overall -- this guest cottage is a perfect home base for exploring the city with some nights or mornings in."
19954872,230034135,2018-01-26,25910066,Lata,Ching Ho’s place was a wonderful home for the price - clean warm & with wonderful restaurants & cafes nearby bus lines both west to Legion of Honor & east to Union Square & walking distance to Golden Gate Park. We never had to wait for the bathrooms the shower was hot with strong pressure. Check in & out was super easy the only couple of things was only 1 key between 2 guests meant we had to stay together all the time & on arrival the guest fridge smelt strongly & guest kitchen often had used dishes unwashed rice cooker or spilt cooking liquid. Had seen another guest posted about this so thought it was being resolved. Anyhow this meant my boyfriend & I ate out every meal which became expensive. We put cereal & soy milk in the main fridge the last couple of days & we did keep fruit nuts & disposable cutlery in our room and took advantage of the awesome boiler & water cooler to make herbal teas. Recommend Cinderella Bakery on Balboa St Blue Danube Cafe on Clement St & Walgreens down Clement or Safeway on 7th for groceries. Enjoy!
12999869,82621531,2016-06-28,5555482,Lance,I loved everything about Sarah's place. The views and neighborhood are great. It's super easy to get downtown. It was a great value and I loved staying there.

We would stay there again any time."
19407065,532926738,2019-09-20,251595994,Sophie,This place is very special your own little slice of San Francisco safe and beautiful neighborhood and Todd and his wife put lots of lovely little extras in the room including wine which was very much needed after a long drive from LA.  We stayed two nights and had the best sleep there. Its location is perfect for any site seeing which Todd also gave us some helpful tips on. Thankyou for a wonderful stay Todd! From Sophie and Mia
18639196,355375522,2018-12-03,2784774,Joey,Great little place to crash at night - clean comfortable though not spacious very conscientious hosts decent access to Muni (the L is 3 blocks away).
7788844,96048714,2016-08-21,75767251,Eleonora,Gil's place is really great! We stayed there for 3 nights and we really enjoyed our time in the apartment! It is exactly as shown in the pictures really modern and clean. Since we arrived late in the night Gil was very kind and allowed us to park in front of his garage! The apt is around 30min distance from the center by Muni and 15min by Uber it was really easy to visit SF! 
17271591,514720997,2019-08-21,29226913,Marcy,Great location bedroom is nice pull out couch matress is thin and uncomfortable but that is pretty standard. Very good value.
1989997,138017441,2017-03-18,114796203,Elle,Michelle and Jeffrey's home is really eclectic and funky  - real hippie vibes. They are so friendly and welcoming you truly become a family member during your stay and they really enjoy showing you around their hometown and bringing you to all the best local spots. Jeff will also ply you with copious amounts of his homemade meads ginger ales and crazy amounts of fresh honey.  It is really close (definitely walking distance) to the Golden Gate Park and hippie hill in a very safe and beautiful neighbourhood. The bed is really comfortable too. Really enjoyed my stay with them.
18928482,281442176,2018-06-24,21850681,Malin,Great host with endless hospitality and lots of local tips. Nice and clean and a great area away from tourists and crowds.
18757990,229295986,2018-01-22,45537197,Jody,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for the weekend and it awesome!  It's such a great location - not only is it pretty centrally located to things but the sights around here are beautiful (and easy to walk to)!

It was definitely enough room for two people and had great amenities.  We had a great time and would definitely recommend this place to others.  We had no problem at all!"
17551632,554141893,2019-10-25,266819,Christopher,Our stay here was wonderful. The place is exactly as the pictures describe.  It’s not very spacious and if you’re taller than 6’ you’d feel quite cramped. We could tell that lots of love was put into the place especially the bathroom. It was pleasant with extra toothbrushes and toiletries. Option of rain shower or hand held. I’d be careful as the curtains don’t really block the water at the ends. We ended up having to use some excess towels to dry the floor. The check in process was very quick our host kept in great touch to ensure that we had no problems. Right outside the room there is a box of travel size goodies like soap chargers lotion or items that previous tenants may have left or just extra stuff we didn’t know we needed. Upon entering the room there was a board that greeted us with our names it made our arrival very comforting. Full size bed fit both of us and when it got warm there was a tower fan that was more than enough for the room. The best part is that our flight arrived in the morning so we asked if we could leave our luggage outside the room before we checked in. Not only did that accommodate that they got the room ready a couple hours early! So grateful for that as we headed to the room right after we grabbed some lunch. (They also included an instruction manual to operate the tv and offered different places to eat nearby!) If you are sensitive to noise from upstairs consider that this unit is below a family’s household and sound is pretty loud. It didn’t bother us much but just a precaution to others. Ultimately I’d recommend this place to anyone.
9225,24991663,2015-01-04,222014,Christen,This place is full of art and personality. It's a very inspired home that made me feel like I knew the hosts even though I didn't get to meet them. Great location easy to park very comfy bedroom with a tv and the check-in and out couldn't have been easier. Gae is an excellent communicator and I felt really lucky that she opened her home for us to stay in.

2096756,331092734,2018-10-01,3077868,Jake,Kim's home worked very well for the three of us.  It was clean very well equipped nice bathroom and lots of natural light throughout -- and comfy beds.  I will stay there again.
8030646,61682235,2016-02-07,20214811,Lauren,Amazing experience bedroom is very spacious Graham was there to meet me when I arrived and I was able to hang out in the common area while he prepared the bedroom. There is a private bathroom and is very nice. Had a wonderful stay! 
3759246,272659626,2018-06-03,16143277,Adrienne,David's place was easy to find and in a nice location.  Communication with him was friendly and made everything easy.  The little apartment had everything we needed and was  nicely decorated.  We would definitely stay there again.
8290464,177735950,2017-08-03,77789499,Jaime,Kim's place is well-represented by the photos.  It's large and comfortable with nice touches and amenities.  Very comfortable bed readily available hot water and an adorable back patio. Great art hanging everywhere!  Front hallway is a bit tight but it's San Francisco. :) Wonderful value in a great neighborhood!
18231,12712925,2014-05-09,5536805,Peter,This place was great! Good living space great kitchen and bath and a spectacular garden that is yours to enjoy. The hosts were perfect. We had a great experience and would definitely stay there again. 
1767569,59924083,2016-01-17,4430906,Sara,Lydia's apartment is gorgeous fully stocked in a neighborhood that's very trendy and walkable and she's very welcoming. We arrived to a sweet note bag of good coffee and Ghirardelli chocolate which was really nice. She also arranged a PackNPlay for our baby.  It was so nice to be able to do laundry and comfortably hang out after the baby went to bed without worrying about waking the baby. The layout of the apartment separates the kitchen and bedroom allowing sleepers and early risers both to enjoy the apartment. We would definitely stay here again!

57479,554935,2011-09-21,1125393,Michael,I work at a church in San Francisco and we often have guests visit from out-of-town.  We used this beautiful apartment to house some special guests and it was great!  We will definitely consider having guests stay there again in the future.  
2926901,49045835,2015-09-30,29816557,Barbara,"Nice hotel excellent location. We loved staying here for our weekend in San Francisco.
Dana was very helpful and responded quickly."
6006768,523045891,2019-09-02,270642859,Toni,Mimi and Mosh were amazing hosts. They met us when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed. They provided us with great recommendations of things to do in the area. Their suite was clean and comfortable and stocked up with snacks and drinks (There was even a bottle of wine waiting for us!). Great location and walking distance to everything would definitely stay here again if we are ever back in San Francisco.
1125079,138977780,2017-03-22,10075926,Qian,"I will give 3 stars to this place.

First of all this place is great in a lot of ways. And here are some things I enjoyed:
-Cheap.
-Housekeeper does a good job at cleaning. 
-The decoration style is really different. If you want to try out something different than your own place give it a shot.
-Neighborhood is gorgeous. View is wonderful. Location is also convenient. Walkable distance to train station (10mins). And also on the main street there are restaurants shops and bars.
-I drove to the place. There was no issue for me to leave my car there for some extra hours. I appreciate it.

Well then why I didn't give 5 stars?? I didn't feel comfortable staying there.

-SO MANY RULES. After I checked in 2 people were telling me all the rules. There are also two sheets of paper on my desk in my room. The host really wanted me to read it. Most of the written rules were capitalized.... 
-You have to speak really really really quietly. 
-You need to wipe the bathroom sink after you use it........ 
-The host let me in through garage. I left my shoes there. And after I was explained all the rules I had to move my shoes to the front door outside. 
-The walls are really not soundproof. Also there are gaps between doors and the door frames. I was lucky that I was the only guest during those days...
-I understand the hosts are trying to save energy. But at night the place is mostly complete dark. And the way that they ask you to turn off lights just made me uncomfortable specially considering I was unfamiliar with the layout.
-The night before I checked out the host asked me to text the housekeeper in the morning and I had to use the garage to go out because the host didn't want suitcases on the stairs inside the house. (maybe because the host doesn't want suitcases to ruin the floor or make noise.)
-One more thing I want to mention is that I found a long hair in my bed. It is possible that they washed the sheet and the hair just got stuck there. But I think I should mention it here. And they didn't offer a new set of sheets.

I understand it is totally okay that there are rules. But my personal experience is that all these things made my stay not very enjoyable. "

I highly recommend it."
2160504,90845079,2016-08-02,41636882,Kevin,Will and his brother Carlos were fantastic hosts; very welcoming and communicative. The space is open airy and ideally located. I would recommend staying here when visiting the Bay Area.

24355042,308581760,2018-08-16,68026398,Janie-Lee,Roam is a unique and beautiful experience. The refurbishment of this old house built early 1900’s is absolutely stunning. You couldn’t get better value for your money; the rooms are beautiful & the location is perfect for exploring SF. We loved the concept of Roam & the entire vibe they host community dinners & other weekly events which would be a great opportunity to mingle. Staff are very very helpful & friendly. Great local tips & coffee :) Will be searching for other branches worldwide! 
5007358,161091187,2017-06-16,91304933,Andreas,Tony was a great host always available and with shirt response times. The apartment was clean and centrally located. We had a great time. :)
1641060,48863691,2015-09-29,32515020,Bernadette,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in San Francisco. Sharon was a great host and was really helpful to us. She even took photos of us on the morning of my nephew's wedding! The location is perfect. Close to West Portal with a real village feel and a great selection of restaurants . We especially liked the Peruvian restaurant Fresca. The Muni is located nearby with easy access to down town.  If you're planning a trip to SF we definitely recommend this airbnb

8739,135186580,2017-03-03,85742490,Paul,This is a great location in the heart of the mission and all of its nightlife.  The room is nicely appointed and comfortable and overlooks a garden.  Being in the back helps keep all of the outside noise of the mission neighborhood at bay but this is a flat so expect some noise from neighbors.
21396964,277595871,2018-06-16,150723193,Arbesa,"We had a good time in San Francisco! It is a really beautiful apartment with good connections to downtown.

2046634,12239130,2014-04-27,11244175,Jim,Kenix is very accomodating and a great host. Due to some travel glitches we arrived very late at night she graciously stayed up and made sure we were settled in and comfortable.
7949624,173720671,2017-07-23,25664580,Johnny,Rania welcomed us into her lovely home overlooking the city with a great smile. The room was very comfortable and well appointed. The shared bath was very clean and full of light. She also had a convenient parking spot right outside the front door. This place was a great find and wouldn't have had it any other way for my first visit to San Francisco.
8904047,343162712,2018-10-30,378447,Michael,Amazingly quiet yet well located near all the things in the Mission! Amy's place is fantastic -- roomy and comfortable -- and she was a great host. Check-in/check-out were a breeze. I would gladly stay there again.

164207,238470719,2018-02-25,174991754,David,Phil is an amazing host. West Portal is a gem for visiting San Francisco. Phil's place is nice clean spacious. Phil is an amazing host and very nice person he really loves hosting. This experience embodies what an Airbnb experience should be.
5500218,431329838,2019-03-31,246498222,Genesis,Aubrey's place is great in a cute neighborhood & with lots of amenities provided. We felt at home and loved the quaint backyard too with a really adorable cat though if thats not your thing will ignore you back. We appreciated the stay here and Aubrey's hospitality.
18391536,241342032,2018-03-08,8442590,Phil,"The home is located on a well traveled thoroughfare with multiple public transportation right at our door and across the street.  A simple downhill walk to Forest Hill Station will bring you either to the downtown areas of The City or in the opposite direction to the SF Zoo or Ocean Beach and the Cliff House.  We parked the car and only used it once to travel down to Menlo Park (an easy drive S/B on 280).  Otherwise all our travel was by the Metro bus or street cars.
Heather fixes a wonderful breakfast to order.  Both are well educated and conversant on many topics.
We have recommended this home to our other family members and friends."
14453697,344511420,2018-11-03,202622725,Hengameh,Nice house for large groups two separate living areas and everyone had their own private space. A bit far from downtown but manageable.
229240,18485820,2014-08-27,18245205,Stefan,I had a very nice stay at this hostel. The staff was very helpful and everything was clean and comfortable. The special thing about this hostel is its very small size and this makes it easy to get in touch with the other guests. In the evenings everyone was sitting in the living room to drink a beer talk play games play music... I liked that very much. Totally different experience compared to larger hostels like HI etc. I liked it and will definitly stay there again if i come back to San Francisco.
12025717,96113498,2016-08-21,20950767,Christie,Vlad and Ira are quick in their response and very helpful. A great host and would stay there again if I ever come to San Fran again. Place is nice and clean very homely feel.

183859,39936716,2015-07-27,3769067,Gwen,The flat was spacious well-appointed and conveniently located. We were away from the main (touristy) parts of downtown but very close to BART and MUNI lines for easy access to everything. This is in a beautiful residential area. Stephen was an accessible and gracious host with tips on getting around as well as things to see and do (in Glen Park as well as throughout the city). I wish our stay had been longer. Comfortable and lovely beds great kitchen with good coffee a living room/library with cool breezes...I hope to return soon.
713877,75455039,2016-05-21,49140922,Vojtech,Everything as promised and the reality is actually better than the pictures. Beautiful cute interior wind protected porch with great view. Perfect location - close to Twin peaks Corona Heights Golden Gate Park N train to downtown.

1907229,11430131,2014-04-02,9639159,Mark,We loved staying in your house Neeta. The pictures do not do it justice. It is a wonderfully appointed space. The backyard is a sanctuary all to itself. We were able to find a parking place right in front and used Uber to get around. Thanks again.
1511076,299855939,2018-07-31,128159867,Shelly,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Jefferson & Gary’s lovely home; they were both warm and gracious hosts. I appreciated all of the thoughtful touches - the lush garden great music heavenly incense and delicious local food recommendations (Ritual Coffee ❤️ and Little Chihuahua burritos were both amazing). The neighborhood is lively and charming. I hope to stay with them again soon! 
7222704,421551553,2019-03-09,209467564,Hege Kristin,We really enjoyed our stay here! This place is super nice clean and internet works grat.

13943674,154934056,2017-05-26,2226839,Christopher,Daryusche is a thoughtful host. He takes care of the small details. The place is small but clean and well located. Good value.
9225,49112930,2015-10-01,24215874,Lance,Staying at Gae's was an interesting and unique experience.  With the contemporary art pieces in the rooms we felt like sleeping in an art gallery~. Gae is not only an enthusiast of art she is also very knowledgeable about the city.  If it wasn't for her we would've never known the Clarion Mural Alley and had fun strolling through it.  Gae respected our privacy very much and she is a very nice host.  Hope the next guests will enjoy the unique experience staying at this artful apt.
4175303,66484678,2016-03-22,36520539,Mary,Stuart 和 Amanda 是一对倡导健康生活的伴侣热爱运动和舞蹈开放包容｡在旧金山这样的一个位置很好的公寓是非常难得的步行可以到旧金山芭蕾舞厅､交响乐团､联合国大厦､各种购物中心虽然房间里没有衣橱但是相比能从他们身上感受到的对生活的热爱真的不算什么｡

6643496,177671540,2017-08-03,59606905,Tim,Wir waren nun zum dritten Mal bei Don und es war wie immer fantastisch. Wir haben selten einen so aufgeschlossenen und liebenswürdigen Menschen kennengelernt. Das Apartment hat alles was man braucht und wenn doch etwas fehlt hilft Don ohne Zögern. Wenn San Francisco dann bei Don! Wir hoffen möglichst bald wieder zu kommen :)

25547908,410176459,2019-02-09,234339943,Annabelle,"Place was okay but very busy.
 One night we had a lot of ants on the table in our bedroom. Jenny responded quickly and brought ant spray. Nevertheless it was a little shock. 
I don’t recommend leaving any kind of snacks in the room. 
 
Location may be great during summer season as it is close to the beach and park. 
For us it was too far away from tourist attractions. We always had to take an Uber and still needed 30 till 40 min to go downtown or to the fisherman’s wharf."
13884730,335267579,2018-10-11,148956599,Terri,Excellent location! If you’re traveling from the airport call and get a shuttle set up through WorldMark. It’s much cheaper than using a Taxi or Uber.
31209988,560143230,2019-11-05,133980375,Megan,Love this place. super clean bed is super comfortable great location beautiful interior. Would definitely stay again already have plans to stay again!

10603148,138412493,2017-03-19,58985611,Christina,John was a great host. We arrived late (11pm) and he made us dinner which was delicious. He was extremely knowledgable and welcoming. He made us feel very comfortable in his home. The home was lovely and his stories regarding the home were very interesting. The view from the roof is spectacular. I would highly recommend his place to others.  The pictures and other reviews are very accurate. 
27529992,550966137,2019-10-19,41315940,Dániel,I cant find words to describe. The house is immaculate amazing details. You can see the detailed taste all around the house and their care. The hospitality from the owner was above any expectation. We bought some Warriors Lakers tickets and we had some issues with the collection. He sorted everything out for us with oatience. You got unlimited water refillers top notch coffee machine with hundreds of capaules high end dryer and washing machine new tv a little garden which is just amazing. Compare to the dumpy San Francisco just couple miles from the centre you will find peace and comfort combined with such a hospitality. 11/10 Thank you!!
16255081,297375112,2018-07-27,120312345,Dan,The building initially seemed a little run down and updated. Once I saw my room I was so pleasantly surprised. The room was so clean inviting and smells great. The young man at the desk was fast and kind and the responses to my questions were all so prompt helpful and professional. This rustic feel and simple room is perfect for the city and I’m going to target returning here when I’m back in SFO. Thank you!!!
905399,71219117,2016-04-24,68322567,Poom,We only briefly ran into Nancy during our 1-night stay but she was very hospitable and accommodating to our needs. Nice/clean room homely vibe and located in a bustling location. Would definitely come back again.
884770,7320208,2013-09-15,5040304,Andrea,"Sandra was an excellent host - she loves San Francisco and is incredibly generous with her passion for life and for  her city. My first experience in SF was extra wonderful thanks to her. She is knowledgeable of attractions shopping restaurants nightlife and healthy/sustainable local grocers.

The location was perfect for transit (steps from the trolly) and for walking to both major attractions and local neighbourhoods (can't avoid the hills!). The area also felt very safe - I  walked alone in the area in the evening without worry.

I am also very grateful for her quick response to my request as I booked my trip very last minute. 

Last but not least the bed was very comfortable!"

16529602,273937746,2018-06-07,111657101,Nicole,"Location was nice & quiet. Not far from the ocean. This is perfect for
two people. Pillow for each guest. Maps to look through. My only complaint is there is only one towel per guest which is fine but if there would have been a spill Idk what we would have done! There was also no hot water on the last day but we were in a hurry and so we just lived with it. Also the map on the wall kept falling over & over again. Little stuff no big deal. Everything other than that was perfect. Clean comfy bed and nice bathroom. "
1069167,114877781,2016-11-20,81291739,Peter,Hey guys all the other reviews pretty much covered it all. So here's my short description. Jenifer and Bob's place is clearly one of the more popular airbnb hosted places to stay.  They are both artists  their place reflects that.  If you're in San Francisco for the artistic aspect of the city then you'll enjoy their place.  It's full of hidden gems and creativity.  They are both very friendly people and will give you suggestions of what they believe would be fun on your trip depending on what you like. Ill definitely be coming back the next time I'm in the city.  
22563498,255200484,2018-04-19,9653748,Jill,Jenny has a beautiful home impeccably restored. She is gracious and generous with beverages and delicious snacks as well as Lush soaps! The location is convenient on the number 1 bus.  Her dogs are very well behaved and delightful to play with. We would definitely stay with her again.

2802480,23325349,2014-11-29,1214282,Jessica,The apartment was in a wonderful neighborhood close to restaurants and shops. We enjoyed walking to the Palace of Fine Arts and the Golden Gate Bridge.

342420,29158218,2015-04-05,2073691,Barry,My family and I had a fantastic staying at Elizabeth and Anthony's Victorian home in the Castro.  It was perfect for us in so many ways!  The location was great for both walking to the restauraunts cafe's stores and Delores Park. We also walked to the Castro and Mission neighborhoods for even more culture and food.  We especially liked Bi-Rite for groceries and ice cream!  The home has 4 large well-lit bedrooms and 2 nicely done bathrooms.  Our family liked the backyard to chill out in the sun and for the BBQ.  The kitchen had everything we needed for cooking and the dining room was big enough for at least 8 people. We did not get to meet the hosts but they made sure our move in and stay was easy and comfortable by texting often to make sure everything was going well.
12026856,176802624,2017-07-31,65742783,Rachael,Maria's house is beautiful and very clean. It was a perfect place for us to stay during our quick visit to San Francisco. We had a car and following Maria's instructions had no issues with parking. We did share a bathroom with other guests but the house is clean and spacious so this was not a problem at all. Thanks Maria!
9926871,86199354,2016-07-15,82573683,A,"James was a great host! Clear communication - we found the house without an issue - it's a close 20 dollar uber x ride from airport. loved the breakfast provisions - thanks for the thoughtfulness. Room with patio is the best comfy blankets although could be a bit bright in the morning so bring eyes shades :) there's not too much around the Visitacion area but we uber pooled to the city and it was cheap. House is tidy the views spectacular. It's quiet so great for some rest away from the hustle. Internet worked perfectly. Lovely cosy vibe. We are glad we didn't stay at a hotel. Recommend! 
"
30512322,456519035,2019-05-21,242094151,Rudy,Eugene was communicative allowed us to drop off our luggage before check in and even provided us with umbrellas! Which we really appreciated since we didn’t know how unpredictable the weather can be. Great room very good local breakfast spots in walking distance.

958507,5827866,2013-07-18,6762150,Cynthia,John was an excellent host and made a great effort to meet with us. He accommodated our early arrival. We especially loved the patio cleanliness of the place and plentiful kitchen utensils and supplies. We were very close to all of the Market Street Muni lines. I picked this rental based on all of the great reviews and I am very glad I did. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it.
32717828,432706866,2019-04-04,791242,Beau,Great place. Clean and Modern. Great communication with host.
21281846,240457408,2018-03-04,40232859,Micah,"Place is okay for a quick stay at a decent price. Nice view in bedroom bed comfortable (though pillows left my neck sore) and some water/basic tea and breakfast food provided. Check in was easy and parking plentiful. 

A bit odd that a security camera is installed in the living room (with a hat hanging on the cord for some reason). Also there is heating but you need to message the host if you want it turned on. Shower has a outdoor floor mat on the floor (also odd) which blocks some of the drainage and causes dirt/grime buildup.

As other reviewers mentioned paper thin walls noisy family upstairs during the day and one shared bathroom for potentially many people are probably the main downsides."
1506702,172752198,2017-07-21,74496007,Krista,Spacious home in an absolutely perfect location.  Ellen was was very responsive and communicative.
9051149,211394677,2017-11-12,3031085,Sebastian,We stayed at Elmer's place for a couple of nights. His apartment is on the second floor of a two-story building. It was easy to find check-in was seamless public transportation just around the corner and a 24 hour grocery store (Safeway) within a ten-minute walk. His dog London is a darling. The home is not big and kitchen bathroom and living area are shared. We chatted with Elmer a couple of times and had some great conversations. We could stay there again.
4069838,229062490,2018-01-21,39330489,Bob,Ashley's place was as described. She was very easy to communicate with and the place was great for our purposes. We stayed in January and my wife and I are in our 50's. We love Airbnb and San Francisco Hotels are very expensive with multiple extras (like parking). So when offered a good deal like Ashley's place we are always a bit apprehensive. Sometimes Airbnb skews towards the young who consider a garage acceptable. We are not those folks. First the neighborhood in neither upscale or seedy. It's in between. The only time we felt at all apprehensive was returning at night after dark as the street is not super well lit and the entryway light doesn't work. Otherwise we walked around without worry. The garage is small but my full sized sedan fit. And the parking space is a precious SF commodity so good deal. Now the place is listed as entire apt. This is true - but - it is first floor garage level and inside the space there is a staircase that leads up to the owners living quarters. There is no door. Ashley was very friendly and gracious so we didn't really mind. But some might prefer even more privacy. One strange and related moment happened at about 2 in the morning or so. My wife had requested cream earlier in the day. It was a late night for us so we were up late. I'm sure Ashley was simply going to sneak down the stairs and graciously drop our cream in the fridge. But my wife was up and found the encounter a bit startling. But no harm no foul. Now this is probably the most well equipped place we have rented. I mean Ashley thought of every touch in every room. So many towels hygienic supplies coffee wine etc. Really nicely done. We lacked for nothing. The beds are extremely comfortable. We both slept very well. She has plenty of local tips and is delighted to share. There is a working computer the wifi worked pretty well and the couch was comfortable. It is a ground floor space so in the winter it was a tad cold. There were space heaters that did a decent job but worth noting. The back yard area if very quaint and worth exploring. Tons of dishes books magazines games just a very well thought out space. We'd definitely stay again.
4902444,274652162,2018-06-09,44388183,Avantika,Superbly well located hostel close to the Embarcadero and Union Square! And right around the corner from San Francisco's Little Italy where you can find delicious food!! A perfect place for solo travellers and for groups! It was a fun and enjoyable stay and most of the staff is super friendly! Highly recommend!!

1206261,20672338,2014-10-03,21362690,Raj,Ashir was cordial to welcome and quick with communication. Clean room and quiet neighborhood. Hard to find parking on road have to make rounds.

23583822,320390832,2018-09-08,159433343,Héline,Ressemble un peu a une auberge de jeunesse avec des chambres privées. Les équipements et lits sont parfaits et d’un bon goût. Nous n’avons pas rencontré les hôtes mais nous avons été accueilli par un petit mot chaleureux. Nous avons fortement appréciés notre séjour.
15267186,535594659,2019-09-24,287276876,Guadalupe,The room was clean and smelled like laundry. The beds were soft and comfy.   It was a little warm during our stay but the windows let in a nice breeze. Only problem with that is the construction outside but after walking all day sleep came easy. Location was great! Walking distance to Chinatown little Italy union square restaurants and 25 minute walk to the piers.  We had a great stay - fantastic host.
18757990,317887784,2018-09-02,60828002,Jessica,Aaron and his wife were great hosts. The appartment had everything we needed and more. The location is perfect. We had a great stay :)
9995426,419785696,2019-03-04,49105430,Aisha,I had a fantastic stay. Expect an incredibly soft bed a cozy eclectic airy bed and living room overlooking (the reason why I booked) the garden patio. Even in the rain I enjoyed the patio given the thick palm trees that provided the perfect canopy. Perfect for my weekend getaway of rest and relaxation. Also super convenient location being near Glen Park BART station.
4533652,45925342,2015-09-07,30403499,Elizabeth And Knute,We absolutely loved our stay at Cc's space. Very welcoming host and perfect location with free parking. The views were incredible from the private deck. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to SF.
17016637,204371490,2017-10-17,17131324,Angela,We wanted a comfortable place to rest for the last leg of our west coast road trip and May's place did the trick! Although it's listed as a private room it felt like we had our own home with the ensuite bathroom and a kitchenette with a mini fridge. Everything was well-stocked with thoughtful additions like coffee cereal and bananas if you want to whip up something really quick before heading out in the morning. I'd highly recommend staying here if you value a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere with very friendly and helpful hosts!
748222,25262359,2015-01-11,17943964,Lizzie,Both of our hosts made us feel at ease when we arrived Yessica outlined lots of activities on map and showed us to our room. The room was exactly as advertised which was great. There was plenty of cooking equipment which made preparing the odd meal at home a breeze. 
34180218,476698210,2019-06-26,16903191,Victor,Amazing stay. Thanks!
8105974,175018362,2017-07-27,7098717,Alex,Simone's place was perfect for our stay the perfect corner in the Mission!  A lovely apartment that felt very spacious for 2 people.  The 2 floors and 2 bathrooms made it a great layout for me and my colleague so we could have a bit of our own privacy.  The place felt very homely and relaxing to be in. Would stay here again!
5413930,323514716,2018-09-15,638322,Allan,I loved our stay in Doris's place. The place was clean full of light lots of space lots of thoughtful touches and has everything you need for a great trip. Each bedroom had a great bed and space. Breakfast was provided - a loaf of bread turkey sausage butter milk coffee eggs. However do make sure to check out nearby places. Tartine is a world class bakery and their breads are awesome. We also had a coffee run one evening in the nearby Foodhall and they had awesome mochi muffins. There were lots of interesting books in the apartment and it was a pity i was too tired from exploring the city the whole day to read although I could have stayed in the apartment all day to just read and enjoy the place! Liz was very prompt in responses and fixing anything that needed taking care of. Someone we met in the city told us something weird that scared us and I checked with Liz about it and Liz was very prompt with her response on getting it sorted out for us. Transportation was nearby but we ended up taking Ubers everywhere since I was traveling with my mom and wanted her fresh when we reached our destination. Ubers were never more than a five minute wait. The washing machine and the dryer were very handy. Highly recommended!
900393,21460629,2014-10-18,14863044,Pierre,"Our stay at Protero Hill was great very well located near downtown San Francisco. The appartement is very well equiped and accomodate 4 peoples easily. 
I would recommend anyone to spend a few days at this appartement to visit San Francisco  
Thank you Irene"
1506702,61890847,2016-02-09,51032420,Harry,Ellen's space was great.  Large and airy rooms tastefully decorated. Great location in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood.  Working with Ellen was a pleasure and she was accommodating for both checking-in and checking-out. 
945748,323087663,2018-09-14,21285705,Mario,Was in San Francisco for two days to work and wanted a place that was in a solid location and had great amenities and Toni's place had just that. I wasn't at the place long as I was gone most of the day but Toni was there to welcome me when I arrived and provided great recommendations on places nearby (including the amazing croissant place across the street). It's near the Presidio and you can realistically walk to many great spots but it's also not a far cab ride from anywhere in the city. The apartment itself is stylish and cozy and the bed comfortable. Place was clean and would recommend to anyone who'll be in San Francisco.
6688004,499033515,2019-07-30,247348519,Ann,Wonderful place to stay in S.F. .
4902855,76073516,2016-05-24,64737508,Lisa,Nice an clean room centrally located easy and uncomplicated Check-in and Check-out. Shared Bathroom area generally clean. We had a really nice stay and would highly recommend Tony's.
8152867,107973422,2016-10-13,22498351,Elizabeth,Carol was extremely welcoming from the start. She communicated promptly and made sure all my questions were answered. The room itself is fantastic! The temperature was great noise level was almost zero there is room to work on a laptop if need be there's a substantial TV in the room great mirror for getting ready in the room itself and a mini fridge for leftovers or bottled water. I really enjoyed my stay!
17592480,445687475,2019-04-29,73138952,Maximilian,"Best place for nice vacation in San Fran. 

The location is closed to downtown and safe. You can achieving downtown treasure island or something else for around 8 dollar with an Uber. 

The place is awesome especially the porch with nice a nice view. Comfortable like home! 

Albert and Tiffany were great hosts. Both were very friendly and interested to gettin know me. 

Highly recommend! Thank you guys."
2081536,154923259,2017-05-26,48945289,Ricky,"Very cool place with very cool people. 

The house has a long history and it's very clean and neatly kept. The room was comfortable. Though you may hear traffic going through I slept just fine. 

Elliot was a great host. He was remarkably friendly and kind very generous and had much to offer. His roommates were equally nice and helpful. One of them was a great baker. 

I really enjoyed my stay at Elliot's and the opportunity to get to know and chat with him and his roommates. Would definitely recommend his place to other Airbnb guests and travelers."
1183521,111792687,2016-11-01,74768154,Dennis,Andrea is a realy nice host and she does everything that we have a wonderful stay. Every question was answered as soon as possible and she has wonderful tips for the neighborhood. (Specifically for Halloween in our case.)
5196399,168619146,2017-07-09,2803574,Sophie,I spent a very nice week at Zain and Duncan's! It is perfect if you travel alone and want to meet other travellers. :)
3081324,109763136,2016-10-23,13148421,Tien,"Wow what a lovely big home. A group of us stayed here for 4 nights in October 2016. It's close to the BART and restaurants. We especially loved the artwork around the home and the outdoor space. 

The house is close to the highway but coming from London it didn't bother us.

Carrie is a very good host she responds instantly and was always at hand to help. 

"
6600081,58480483,2016-01-02,17483969,Olutola,"Del was a very fantastic host.

The house was extremely clean and spotless. I had the opportunity to meet her and have conversation with her and  she's an all round accommodating and nice person.

I would definitely be coming back here. "
4526608,356261389,2018-12-07,229339806,Aramis,Perfect place for those who want a real sf experience. The backyard is like an added bonus ;) no complaints. They are by far the best hosts I’ve encountered .! 100/10 would totally stay here again if I have the chance.
54518,343506155,2018-10-31,6171484,Lori,Outstanding location very comfortable unit. Super fun exploring North Beach restaurants. Easy to get to the ferry building and we were only two blocks from work!
4093967,325814628,2018-09-20,175026873,Peter,Skate and Jeannie were very gracious hosts. We came down for medical visits at Mission Bay and the location proved to be very convenient. We especially enjoyed their beautiful garden with a panoramic view of San Francisco. Their home is in a lovely and quiet neighborhood and we hope to visit them again!
12382688,126166318,2017-01-09,1753098,Liz,Excellent! The flat was very clean and set up beautifully. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
3394127,100025177,2016-09-07,6329128,Sarah,Andrew's place was perfect for our first stay in San Francisco. We were out on the town most of the day but really enjoyed spending the evenings winding down by watching TV and taking in the amazing Bay Bridge light show in the window. Yaya the cat was a joy to be around. Andrew was responsive and flexible. Would stay here again! 
229240,1178937,2012-04-25,2042293,Matthew,I had a great stay here.  Clean facilities wonderful staff friendly guests.  What more could you ask for?  Also very close to lots of delicious Chinese food.  I would definitely book with them again.
7884875,319227200,2018-09-05,95290187,Ben,Jason's home was perfect for our stay in San Francisco! The views from the balcony were outstanding and the location above the Castro and close to MUNI was very convenient. The home itself was very comfortable and stylish. Jason was super helpful throughout the process from booking to check out. He was very responsive to messages gave great local advice and even had local wine and veggie crudities when we arrived. I definitely recommend this place for your visit to SF!
12657863,422255470,2019-03-10,227361422,Leonardo,I stayed in Daniel's accommodation for a 08 day stay. place is clean and comfortable. public transport is accessible to a few meters from accommodation with direct line to the center and other regions.
4888308,67969242,2016-04-01,9933895,Josie,A perfect Airbnb! Maya and Brian's guest home is warm sweetly furnished bright tidy comfortable quiet and has a great kitchen for cooking. It's a pleasant walk to Dolores Park and great shops markets and restaurants. The bedroom window looks out on a pretty lush garden. It was a nice treat to find lovely fresh spices in the kitchen!
3029597,204759154,2017-10-19,7315969,Alina,Great host was very nice and accommodating. The room is clean and comfortable. Superb location!
6505426,196609468,2017-09-23,18226962,Aldo,"We stayed in 4 people at Jeff and Huib's place. Rooms are nice and comfortable. Jeff and Huib's provided many usefull information about San Francisco in their file and the various travel guides they keep in the rooms. Jeff and Huib lives downstairs so it's really easy to ask them for help and the rooms are independent in the house which makes you feel at home. 
The place is well located close to Dolores park Castro and many nice restaurants. We also never had trouble parking near their house.
Great place to stay in San Francisco !"
1525137,34791266,2015-06-12,308751,Edward,Dions place is very true to its description. The place is very well kept and there were welcome gifts (wine and pastries) for us at check-in. The place is super easy to access and the checkin process was seamless. The location is ideal since california street has a bunch of transit points. The only thing that came up was temporary late morning construction which was a bit loud. Fortunately we were up and about when the construction started.
2825966,25561953,2015-01-19,25345728,Alden,"""The studio was at a great location of San Francisco. Two blocks away from the N line and from the great brunch place Zazie. It was comfy and quiet for having a jetlagged night sleep. The only negative I found is that the apartment is not very sunny since it faces to the north. But that is okay if you are just sleeping there."""
654279,218748179,2017-12-14,15420254,Bridgette,Tim & Chris were great hosts!  Their place is very clean and very comfortable!  The room is big quiet and comfortable. It was convenient for me to get to where I needed to go in the city easily.  I had a great time.  Thank you!
8048653,47117975,2015-09-15,40849388,Livia,"We had a great time at Emanuel's he and his roommate Erik were wonderful hosts and would give us great tips about what to do in San Francisco!
The place is absolutely marvelous and brand new our bed was installed just the day we arrived and was super comfy! We had our own bathroom and everything was superclean and tidy. We would come back at any time! If you have the chance to stay with them do it!"
5007358,339692928,2018-10-21,52561702,Cathy,This is a great place!   There are a number of rooms each with its own code on the door.  I could hear other people around sometimes but nobody was loud or unpleasant.  Room 20 is fantastic -- a window that looks out on O'Farrell St. and a perfect tiny bathroom all to yourself.  The bathroom would probably not be manageable for a very large person but I'm petite so it was fine for me.  The bed was super comfy and the room was spotless.  The room is up two flights of stairs with no elevator so it would not be a good fit for someone who can't handle that.  The Tenderloin is rather gritty but the worst of it is a few blocks away -- I thought the area right by Tony's place was just fine.  I highly recommend Tony's place if you want to stay in this area!
17696905,247520146,2018-03-28,43427426,Razvan,The Red Victorian is an amazing place! Very vibrant and special in a really great area. The room (Golden Gate Park) was really nice the bed was HUGE and the decor was just incredible. The whole vibe in the house was nice and the people there were very open and sociable. A lot of great spots nearby and lovely neighbourhood. I highly recommend it!
14386727,479916251,2019-07-01,246024642,Thomas,Great place to stay between the airport and the bulk of the city. Right by T-line metro for easy transportation without a car.
1633173,104799135,2016-09-28,91138639,Doron,Air mattress was an uncomfortable surprise for us. Location is a bit far and takes a lot of time either with a car or public transportation. Price is good comparing with others
32770430,456148557,2019-05-20,21616976,Stephanie,Loved the 2 nights we spent at Nejdeh's! Would highly recommend!
4631873,143203322,2017-04-10,47555618,Simón,Great host and location. Nice and clean. 
732779,499608287,2019-07-31,2428828,Kirk,We hosted a rotating set of family at Lindsay and Brain's place after the birth of our first child. The house was an ideal place for out of town guests to gather as there was ample space and a great location.
6423158,87794824,2016-07-21,3495683,Lydia,Alice is one of the best hosts we've had in the past several years.  She is extremely organized and provided us with a wealth of information.  Her apartment is lovely and is located in a upscale neighborhood.  Alice and her husband are very thoughtful and went out of their way to assist us.  If you plan on visiting San Francisco you would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not stay at Alice's apartment.
29828791,502606939,2019-08-04,11522078,Michael,Dom was very responsive and the place was incredibly clean and stylish. Locations not too bad. Like that the place has a gym rooftop patio and simply parking options.
5572169,59860150,2016-01-16,42573050,Jesse,Alison has a lovely room super comfortable with a fantastic view and loads of privacy. Check in was super seamless came with a quick tour of the house and living quarters. I'd highly recommend this room and the bed (wow)! Also near a great gym and restaurants. Will be coming back for sure :) thank you!

1738415,103901414,2016-09-24,20496852,Marissa,We really enjoyed our stay at Donnas place in Hayes Valley. Such a great area easily accessible to all the sites and some good restaurants within walking distance. We had our kids with us who are both under five it felt safe in the neighbourhood which was important to us. Donna also called us a cab on our departure which was a lovely gesture. 
1665516,368982039,2019-01-08,218615605,Jonas,Very nice hosts and clean apartment in quiet area!

He was also very helpful and recommended many things to do.  The house is spectacular and clean.  ""Location Location Location!""  It sits just 1.5 blocks from Haight-Ashbury.  Coffee To The People on the corner of Masonic and Haight is  wonderful place to start before a big day of exploring.  Oh yeah...don't leave your phone in a Lyft or Uber (I did).  It may take all day (and night) to retrieve it!  Have Fun!  You're in San Francisco!!!!"
5696895,59185472,2016-01-07,47745154,Gentaro,Claudia was very friendly and thoughtful. Room and bathroom was very clean and room has great views. I was early checked in and check out but it's was flexible and very easy. Location is perfect in the inner sunset very safe and quiet neighborhood near by Golden gate park UCSF and MUNI N line stop. If you're looking for stay in the SF I recommend here!
456568,342925984,2018-10-29,48474668,Carole & Hervé,"Agréable séjour dans une belle chambre vaste et propre d'une maison au passé
historique riche. Idéalement situé dans un quartier calme tout proche de rues très vivantes. José et Jeffrey sont des hôtes disponibles agréables et très serviables qui ne sont pas avares de bons conseils. Nous avons pu enfin vivre une vraie expérience AirBnb et donc partager avec nos hôtes.
Nous les recommandons."
20541727,201139622,2017-10-07,13412621,Mónica,"I've stayed for two months in Pete's place. It was a great experience. I'll miss my comfortable bed and the awesome view from my room. Pete is a very nice and kind hoster. He is always looking out for all things for improving our stay. The communication with him is very easy. 
The location for me was perfect! Every day I walked around 10 minutes to Castro Station and there I used to take Muni bus to downtown. When I used to come back at home I had many options it depended on the time or my location. I used to take a bus (33 or 35) or if I had the energy I came back walking. Pete´s place is 5 minutes walking one of the most famous Street in San Francisco ""Castro"". In Castro Street you can find a lot of good restaurants and grocery places.
In the future If I have the opportunity to come back to SF for short time for sure I'd like to stay again in Pete´s place.
Thanks Pete for everything :)
______________________________________________________________
Estuve hospedada por dos meses en casa de Pete. Realmente fue una gran experiencia. Extrañare mi comoda cama y la espectacular vista que tenia desde mi habitación. Pete es muy amable y siempre esta pendiente de que todas las cosas se encuentren en orden para una mejor estadia y convivencia. La comunicación con él es muy fácil. La ubicación es perfecta cada día caminaba alrededor de 10 minutos hasta la estación de Muni Castro y allí tomaba el transporte hasta el centro. Al regreso a casa tenía muchas opciones de trasporte normalmente tomaba un bus (33 o 35) o si tenía fuerzas caminaba. La casa de Pete esta a 5 minutos caminando de la famosa calle Castro allí puedes encontrar muchos restaurantes y supermercados.
Si tengo la oportunidad de regresar a SF sin pensarlo pedíria a Pete hospedarme nuevamente.
Gracias por todo Pete!"

He greeted us when we arrived and helped us get settled; he had maps of the city water and a snack drawer ready for us. The room was super clean and he had everything from mini shower amenities to a hair dryer if we forgot anything.   We learned about August Home which is an amazing key-less entry system that was so helpful when we came home.

Glenn is super friendly. We will definitely recommend to friends and see if there's availability next time we're in the city! Thanks Glenn! "
6662128,80746356,2016-06-19,66987755,Nicole,Gary was super nice and helpful. He was very accommodating even when we had to push back our arrival time and also when we accidentally locked our keys in the building. He also gave great recommendations of places to eat nearby. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean however it is shared so the first night of our stay one of the other tenants left it a little messy but that's not Gary's fault at all. Just a heads up the surrounding area is very noisy. There are two strip clubs nearby so at night you can hear music blasting people yelling etc. very clearly through the walls. In the mornings (I'm talking 6 am) there are clubs that open up so the noise starts right back up again. The area itself seemed safe enough though at night I would not have felt comfortable walking around if I had not been with my husband.The location was great for us though. This place is in walking distance to China Town Little Italy Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 33 which were all of the places we planned on visiting. I loved that we didn't have to worry about paying for parking everywhere we went. There is a parking lot right across the street that charged $15 a day which really isn't bad considering most hotels charge more. Overall had a great stay and really enjoyed talking to Gary.
4902565,107974605,2016-10-13,59400166,Sherrie,"We just wanted a place to sleep for One Night in San Francisco at a good rate.
This fit the bill.  Extremely small space but cozy & quiet.  No ambiance so
do not expect too much.  Old but very clean and the bed was totally comfortable.
Access to the rooms are steep stairs so make sure you can handle it if you are
an older adult.  The shared shower outside the room was not a problem.
Overall experience was fine.  Communication with management was superb.
I would recommend this for short stays or for someone who just wants a place
to sleep only. "
21327857,301203048,2018-08-03,14855503,Jorge,Azul's place it's located in a great neighborhood with unique and local places to eat and visit that we enjoy a lot. The communication with the host was very friendly and helpful. We stay in San Francisco to attend the city marathon and this was a perfect choice. 
2483759,173744776,2017-07-23,31627561,Ricky,Awesome place. Convenient to get to anywhere. Highly walkable and parking is fairly easy.
19331975,456479149,2019-05-21,153776426,Marilyne,This place is amazing. It is like home far away from home. It is so clean. The host is so friendly. We had our own mini-kitchen. We used the washingmachine. At the end of the Street there is a busstop who can take you to the center of the city. We would love to go back to this amazing Air bnb!!! This is the best Air bnb you’ll ever stay in.

7715542,58309311,2016-01-02,42950018,Stephen,Great location.  Informative and accommodating host.  Perfect place to drop your bags while you're out exploring the city.  
1932019,136423825,2017-03-10,78151845,Joanna,I had a wonderful stay at the garden house. It was close to public transport and wonderful restaurants cafes and bakeries were within walking distance. Would definitely stay again. 
752607,72702688,2016-05-04,7096411,Kate,"Lily was very easy to communicate with and went out of her way to ensure that I even had a blender in the house for my morning smoothie!

The house itself is very spacious and comfortable to be in.
"
6957662,468561109,2019-06-12,90992149,Irochka,"We were enjoying high ceilings stylish garden and overall atmosphere of the place and neighborhood. 
Gary is responsive and caring host and we are so grateful he extended his hospitality when our flight got canceled.
We were unlucky with the heat wave in San Francisco and I wish there was more fresh  air in the studio when we returned home in evenings.
Overall it is a great way to experience San Francisco!"
10930490,80161361,2016-06-16,64705339,Karina,Upon our arrival we already felt comfortable in the place. The snacks and all the little things that were provided helped make our stay even better! We really appreciated the clipper cards already provided since we had never been to SF and would've been completely lost otherwise. Overall the place was super comfortable and our stay was great!
5904304,124345308,2017-01-01,38189202,Una,Great location for exploring on foot. Sebastian was very reachable. 
5151423,465971204,2019-06-08,2199578,Liz,My father stayed at Lily's and he really enjoyed it. Bed was comfortable there was plenty of space and apparently the local suggestions were better than what I provided him with.   It's definitely on the list of places to recommend to friends and family visiting. Thank you Lily!
2486953,25415089,2015-01-15,3209280,Brian,"Vincent was great from start to finish.  He was prompt with his responses regarding booking and provided an excellent overview/tour of the space upon arrival.  I felt very welcome and appreciated his texts checking in to make sure everything was working out and the great snacks he left for me.  Vincent was a wonderful host.

The apartment is beautiful exactly as in the photos and immaculate.  The bed and linens were wonderful the bathroom facilities and amenities were superb and the place was very quiet.

Another favorite part of my stay was the neighborhood.  The 24th Street business district is a very short walk with a Whole Foods wonderful coffee and other shops and a great gym.  There is also easy public transportation nearby which I used to attend my meetings in the financial district.  The Castro business district is also a very short walk.

I'm in SF frequently and have always stayed in hotels.  This was by far my best visit to the city because of the home and the neighborhood.  I really felt like a local."
24379811,563100547,2019-11-11,35236817,Nicola,Karen’s place is great! Also she is a very welcoming and responsive host. Would definitely recommend!

6911587,298766809,2018-07-29,22567107,Salvatore,excellent hospitality!! House is really close to the bart station! And near many restaurants. I really enjoyed my holiday

おうちもすごく素敵でｸﾘｰﾝで快適でした｡
またぜひ滞在したいです｡"
17191322,149167659,2017-05-02,4962701,Nicole,Host did a great job with the space. It's perfect for a short stay in SF and the bed was very comfy. So many things within walking distance as well. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that it was extremely hot in the studio. SF was experiencing very warm weather during our stay and the studio is on the 4th floor with no A/C. 
23044309,405226653,2019-01-26,238821484,Charles,Good location. Extremely limited parking. Good room that most people would be very happy with
1023586,453400306,2019-05-15,71860654,Nick,Great bargain in the heart of San Fran. Kameh is very helpful with tips about getting around and the space was very clean. Would stay here again if I come back to the Bay Area!
10789339,246955137,2018-03-26,11020751,Korcan,amazing view!
68239,997840,2012-03-13,1857959,Neil,Philipp was very responsive organized and easy to work with. Place is a nice top-floor apartment spacious and well kept. Over the hill south of Dolores and not the most beautiful building or cutest block but easy access to restaurants on Valencia and reasonable to find street parking (by SF standards). Great stay overall.
18999934,165092698,2017-06-30,62198135,Jamie,Very nice stay. Easy check in and the private parking was the best! Behind a gate and felt very safe. The room and common areas were very nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable and we had fun playing pool. Great value in SF :).
4880695,39289930,2015-07-22,18474786,Felicitas,Peter was a great host and always very helpful. For instance when I asked him for a hair dryer he immediately went to buy one which was very nice. There was enough room for our two families (6 kids and 4 adults) although some of the beds would have been a bit small for adults. The kitchen and the bathroom were functioning well. The flat is a good base for visiting San Francisco and is good value for money although you should be aware that it is not brand new any more. But Peter makes up for all potential shortcomings by being very attentive and a great host. 
1759087,216629020,2017-12-04,3921542,James,Gerardo’s listing is two blocks down from some nice spots on Potrero Hill. Came for a business trip. It was a nice place to rest my head. 
7886634,270597738,2018-05-29,3701393,Daniel,Becca is very professional and communicative. The apartment is in a great location and exactly as described.  Loved the keypad access to the unit.  Comfortable bed nice decor.
12930338,266822840,2018-05-20,15608807,Sandeep,We are so glad we chose Anna's place for our stay in San fransisco. The highlights for us were the lovely backyard garden proximity to public transport and markets (not necessarily in that order). Both the large stores (safeway) and the bus stop are just a few steps away. The area is also extremely safe making it east to explore this beautiful city. The room itself is cozy and is ideal for a couple. It's filled with books so if you like reading you are in for a treat. The room has all the amenities you would need. I only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the lovely little backyard. Our son had a lot of fun.
4104344,199737073,2017-10-02,33501479,Sophie,"Very good location to discover SF. Safe area. The room is exactly as the description says. Very clean. Can be a little noisy. 
We really enjoyed our stay. We recommend it."
7344289,46088466,2015-09-07,43219151,Lu,My family really enjoyed this place. Not only was it comfortable as described online but was conveniently located..less than 15 min walk to Golden Gate Park and within walking distance to lots of dinning choices.  Will definitely stay here again.
14671675,550903207,2019-10-19,45460629,Ari,Pete and Ivan's place is in a great location--BART amazing restaurants and murals are all nearby. It's also a short walk to parks Market Street etc.
3727061,138422888,2017-03-19,39973835,Matt,Tim was an excellent host and spent time telling us about the area and offering tips for our visit.
99094,427528349,2019-03-24,15865900,Thomas,I had a lot of fun and good beers.
16407735,178510003,2017-08-05,102115045,Reinier,Servio's place was absolutely perfect for my stay in SF. Very close to restaurants grocery stores and other convenience stores. It's also extremely close to the MUNI which was very useful in navigating through the city. (TIP: Spend the 3 extra bucks and invest in a Clipper card. Take the MUNI into the city and just lyft/uber to your location from there. You'll save time because of the traffic as well as money!) Servio was such an accommodating host as well. Every request and question was fulfilled and answered thoroughly. He even allowed us to store our luggage at his place after check out because we had a later flight that night. Awesome host! Awesome place! Will stay again whenever I'm in the city!
3261876,26212359,2015-02-07,12181759,Giuseppe,Josh is a very friendly and caring host and I really enjoyed staying at his place. The apartment is located in a quiet street just off a main street with restaurants and cafes. The room is bright and spacious and the bed is very comfortable. 
1671260,457692913,2019-05-24,189978156,Rui,Sasha and Matt are super friendly and helped me with a late check in issue. Love to stay there. Will definitely go back again.

8524982,184466120,2017-08-19,34800073,Sally,My husband and I very much enjoyed Shane's room. It was very private roomy and comfortable. And very clean. Shane was very prompt with communication and welcoming on arrival. We really appreciated being able to store our luggage on arrival and checkout this just made our arrangements so simple. Thanks Shane! The location was AMAZING! Those views!!!! We really felt we were amongst it all at Shane & Shaudi's. Walking distance to the piers fantastic coffee and food and transport close by. I would highly recommend Shane's place if staying in SF.
29018006,409104821,2019-02-06,136162892,Maximilian,Lovely apartment great private room and bathroom with everything you could ask for. Smooth check in even if I didn’t get to meet Sara in person. Comfy bed and quite backyard facing room. The building has an awesome rooftop and gym. For me it was also walking distance to the city center - I say “for me” because I like to walk for a bit ;) Thanks Sara!
77175,227019870,2018-01-13,17050083,Fairouz,First of all I would like to thank Alaa for being the best host we could have wished for! Alaa is truly a wonderful person. He is open friendly funny and very passionate about cooking. The ambiance was very special talking about different cultures and how we live together in this world. Last but not least the food is amazing. Thank you again Alaa for this experience. It made our day. We’ll see you again soon to cook together! 
971116,452188799,2019-05-12,93370965,Joseph,Michael and David are fantastic hosts. They are very contactable right from the start and really go the extra mile to make your stay comfortable. Their home is very inch as spacious and beautiful as the photos look as well and the bed is super comfy :)   Not to mention their 2 adorable dogs who are very well behaved. Location is very central as well with a lot of great restaurants/cafe and transportation options within walking distance. Had a truly wonderful stay in San Francisco in this home :D
3720392,116802459,2016-12-03,20331470,Emma,Such a beautiful place! This is my third stay in the Orange Suite. I just keep coming back for more! Thanks for having me Kelly. 
25463,28779179,2015-03-30,17304283,Julian,Patrick needed to alter our accommodations before our arrival but moved us to the private Urban Retreat studio for no extra charge. The apartment was fabulous very clean and well-apppointed. There was a bit of a delay retrieving the keys from his cousin but that was a minor issue. The Lower Haight is a fantastic neighborhood and Patrick's home was close to some great restaurants shops and public transit. Check-out was a breeze. Overall a very enjoyable experience.
207980,17035624,2014-08-06,11015829,Philippe,"We had a wonderful stay in Bruce's house. It was very nice and comfortable well equiped and benefits a very good situation as a ""base camp"" to visit SF. Nextdoor bus stop and supermarket are most useful."
10494263,294155933,2018-07-21,14371544,Paul,We had a wonderful time in San Francisco in no small part because of this beautiful bright apartment in a great part of the city. The host was friendly and easy to communicate with and the pets were lovely. We would be delighted to stay here again. 
14938407,182013461,2017-08-13,53739001,Drix,Very good host very organized everything is labeled. Thank you very much Victor. My was very happy.

15860884,120930441,2016-12-12,23150118,James,Excellent accommodations exactly as described.  This is a small room with plenty of room for the bed and small table but little else.  Perfect for a single traveller or couple looking for cleanliness and comfort not spaciousness.  Great location close to Limon (the ceviche and roasted chicken can't be beat) and Beretta (world-class pizza and more) as well as numerous bars and the BART. Jeffrey is a fantastic host very friendly and excellent communicator.  Thank you.
631635,22535253,2014-11-09,22295609,Francois,Really nice place we spent 4 days in SF and we were not often in Betty's appartement but it's a beautiful flat where you have enough space to be confortable and the best is for the panoramic view from the living room it is so awesome!
24043927,404880966,2019-01-25,37699473,Howard,The host canceled this reservation 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6348742,60062133,2016-01-18,644490,Kyle,"Lloyd was a phenomenal host. He helped us wrangle our luggage stroller car seat etc. from the cab had a bed set up for my daughter to sleep in and showed us all the features of the apartment even though we showed up late. He made us feel incredibly welcome.

The apartment itself was perfect for our short stay. It had a large living room with a desk and a pull-out sofa bed a kitchen and a large bedroom. We fit four comfortably: my son in a portable crib in the bedroom with my wife and I and my daughter on the extra mattress on the floor of the living room. The location is perfect as well steps from Noe Valley restaurants. We hiked up to Kite Hill to check out the views and down to the Mission for the culture (a bit of a walk but worth it). 

Overall a great stay. I'd stay here again."
1919372,13408756,2014-05-27,1189924,Julie,What a find!! This apartment is spotless spacious and immaculate. Located in NOPA we were within easy walking distance to a slew of great restaurants and shops. Everything about this place was easy comfort. We will be back!
212783,341378698,2018-10-26,65376431,Holly,Spacious private room with comfy beds. Shared bathroom was clean and easy to access. Quiet building and easy check in and out process. The location is ideal for a stay in the Haight or to roam the rest of the city. I wish I could have stayed longer than a night and definitely will stay again. Josh was professional and accessible.
10455995,108972866,2016-10-18,77633193,Ashley,Great place to stay.

4773944,521273768,2019-08-31,60284153,Jess,Staying at Maryam’s place was great. I wish there had been a dresser for us to unpack into but other than that it was totally lovely!
10058134,262118305,2018-05-07,28417564,Christophe,Gloria was a great host and my parents visiting from abroad had a fantastic experience thanks in part to Gloria's hospitality.
6662231,142945576,2017-04-09,1819246,Sheila,We will definitely come back and stay here again. It is located in a perfect location for North Beach and at a very good price for the area.

23326161,434889388,2019-04-08,66856221,Jakub,Very comfy room in spacious mansion. Room is clean nice and equipped in everything you may need. Both hosts are very friendly and are making sure you enjoy the stay. We definitely had great time in SF and big part of it was our comfortable base at Levon & Ashley. Highly recommended.
394575,34846416,2015-06-13,8807126,Ally & Hattie,Mike and Nic have a lovely apartment the photos are very accurate. The neighbourhood is quiet safe and well-connected. There are lots of shops bars and cafes a short walk away and a really convenient bus down to Mission just up the road. Mike and Nic were away during our visit so we didn't get a chance to meet them but they were very helpful via email. We had a minor breakage and they immediately organised for someone to come by and repair it. Very good hosts with a wonderful property.
3811916,22767650,2014-11-14,6104545,Wendi,Before I reserved Amanda's place I e-mailed her with several questions and she graciously answered all of our questions very quickly! Amanda greeted us upon our arrival and she was very nice & welcoming! The location was great and within walking distance to the Castro the Mission and Noe Valley minus a few hills of course! The ceilings are low but we didn't notice to much because the space is very bright open and cozy! It was very well stocked and had everything you might need. Amanda worked with us to make sure we had parking for our rental car as the road out front has a 2 hour limit without a permit. We would definitely recommend Amanda's place!
17833058,147813835,2017-04-28,11027406,Matt,Great small one bedroom. No tv but who needs one in this great area. Grant St is one of the coolest boutique style streets in San Francisco and it's right in the middle of one of the best neighborhoods North Beach in San Francisco. 
6922612,109625196,2016-10-22,3971899,Scott,Great place and great size especially for SF.  The view was a huge bonus will definitely stay there again on future trips.

6329731,143195024,2017-04-10,42132752,Jorge,Ding es una persona super amigable y dispuesta ayudar siempre que uno lo necesite. El dormitorio cuenta con una cama acogedora y confortable también tiene un buen juego de cuarto al igual que un armario.

4841027,548430726,2019-10-17,67908989,Vanessa,"Jason was a great host. He was welcoming and gave good advice. He even did some washing for us. 

His place is well located and street parking was no problem at all.
The space was good and as other reviews have noted the bed was incredibly comfortable. We slept so well! 

Unfortunately the house and bedroom in particular did have a strong smell of stale cigarette smoke but otherwise the place was perfect."
437385,356584094,2018-12-08,4894918,Margo,This is my second stay with Melanie. The first was four years ago. While not close to where I needed to be during the day it is in a perfect location near the water and a beautiful place to rest after a full day. I returned to Melanie's because of her kindness beautiful and interesting space parking and location. It was an easy Uber/Lyft ride to downtown.  I will return again the next time I'm visiting SF.  I highly recommend her as a host.
2770268,18472753,2014-08-27,15755256,Sibylle,"Es war mein erstes mal dass ich eine Unterkunft über Airbnb gebucht habe. Etwas unsicher war ich schon und die Bewertungen habe ich genau gelesen.  Ein super gemütliches Häuschen in einer hervorragenden Lage. Von hier aus haben wir (mein Sohn 12 Jahre und ich) vier Tage die Stadt erkundet.
Raman ist ein sehr guter Gastgeber zurückhaltend und völlig unkompliziert. Es war alles vorhanden und langweilig wäre es uns auch nicht geworden wenn wir einen Tag im Haus hätten bleiben müssen. Bücher sind genügend da.
Die Gegend ist sehr ruhig die Nachbarn aufgeschlossen und sehr hilfsbereit. 
Wenn ich wieder einmal in San Francisco bin dann gern wieder hier in Raman´s Haus."
8187584,101642626,2016-09-14,29250519,Pamela,The room was spacious and comfortable. There was a musty smell in the room. Also the walking upstairs was very loud in the room. So if you want to sleep in that makes it difficult. Having a separate entrance did provide extra privacy which was nice. Ed is a very nice man.

13169268,522168308,2019-09-01,27653577,Caterina,Bartlett is located at an excellent spot to explore the city - also very convenient to reach from the airport. The room was actually better than what it looked like in the pictures and it was very clean! Perfect for a short stay would suggest to anyone who doesn’t want to splurge on super expensive SF hotels.

8763407,52140099,2015-10-26,16502012,Brandon,I had no idea what I was in for going into this my short weekend trip developed into a fun adventure meeting all sorts of interesting and kind people. Zaine and Duncan were excellent hosts. I will consider coming back in the future.
27777839,550481981,2019-10-18,154593847,Eric,This was an all around wonderful and highly recommended experience!! Batshir was very thoughtful and responsive. The home is beautiful  and location very convenient. You won't be disappointed! Thank you!
12930338,417028061,2019-02-25,8157121,Dvera,Traveling with a pet isn't always easy but I really appreciated Anna and her family's welcoming of my small dog and I. They made their backyard  accessible for us which is a big deal when traveling in a city. I had privacy to work on my writing but Anna and all were very friendly and attentive.
21123508,250074456,2018-04-03,99641762,Ted,The room was very spacious and clean. The apartment in general is nice and stylish. The hosts were always very quick to respond when I messaged.
470686,70291143,2016-04-17,4422066,Mehan,Had a great stay at Hao's apartment--it was super clean and everything was exactly as pictured. The block that the apartment is on is fairly quiet though it's just a short walk from all of the Mission's bars and restaurants as well as the BART station. Hao was super friendly and welcoming and his flexibility regarding check in/check out times was greatly appreciated. I would definitely stay with Hao again--highly recommended!
20905918,532971022,2019-09-20,1627337,Adam,Chester and Summer were great hosts. The listing is a very comfortable private room in their home. Perfect location for exploring the Mission.
6796392,87203766,2016-07-19,27021084,Andrew,What an amazing place to stay in San Francisco!  The space is flawlessly decorated and the views of the city are amazing.  You're on the top of the hill on Castro Street so it's an easy place to explore this vibrant neighborhood.   The instructions were clear and concise and there were wonderful furnishings.   We really felt like we lived in a beautiful home for our one week!  Thanks Janet!!  I'll definitely stay here again on my next trip to the West Coast.   Stay here if you can.  You'll love it.  
8568826,104051973,2016-09-25,6832335,Amanda,I had a great experience staying with Mari and Gil. The home looks just like the pictures (it really is that sunny!) the bedroom was very comfortable and Mari and Gil were welcoming and friendly but very respectful of personal time and space. Bernal Heights while a little bit out of the way is a beautiful neighborhood with a lovely charm and some of the best views of the city; I loved going for a run around the park and was amazed at the 360 degree view of SF every day that I came home. Mari also teaches fantastic sushi and ramen classes - I highly recommend signing up if you are interested in a unique fun and delicious way to spend an afternoon. Overall I had a great experience here and am already wishing I could go back!
1333047,485932325,2019-07-11,114324126,Jennifer,This was a perfect home base for us during our 4 night stay. Everything we needed and great communication with Graham. We especially loved the attention from the house cat! The room and bed were so comfortable! This room was in a great location to get away from hustle an bustle of busier areas. Plus this neighborhood was full of cool restaurants and coffee shops. Loved every minute of our stay! Highly recommend this place and host!
31269377,507597176,2019-08-11,20436671,Timothy,Mason’s place was clean convenient and very well decorated. It was the perfect place to stay to be close to my office in Soma.
7923146,219526258,2017-12-17,38355381,Susan,"A NORTH BEACH GEM   (5*)

 (Website hidden by Airbnb) Four of us (2 couples)had the pleasure of staying in this apartment over the weekend. It is in a perfect location in North Beach walking distance to many restaurants shops & attractions. Virginia is a charming & superb hostess – she met us upon arrival and showed us around. The place is exactly as advertised warm & welcoming and very well stocked (she included breakfast food for us!)  It is an excellent value   for the area – I would not hesitate to recommend it and look forward to staying there again……….thanks Virginia"
6629798,76523842,2016-05-28,35691829,Sylvie,"Very nice and clean place to stay. Enough parking space. Lovely bed and bathroom.

A good place to stay!"
38486895,566817073,2019-11-20,2590354,Wayne,"I needed a place for one night at the last minute and close to Golden Gate Park Maxwell's place served my needs but was a bit more drab than I anticipated. That said (even at $193 for the night) it was one of the cheapest options left that had two queen sized beds. So while I probably would not return it did serve my needs and the communication from Maxwell was reliable.  On the plus side it is located in a great and safe neighborhood - with many good nearby restaurants/coffee shops and easy bus/uber access to anywhere you would want to visit including GG Park Marin Headlands Presidio and downtown. Street parking is relatively easy to find in the neighborhood. 

The room is one of two off a common hallway - you have a key pad entry to the common hallway and another for the room. Room #3 was what I rented - good for two people traveling together that do not wish to share a bed. On the negative side the room is very dingy dirty carpets dirty bathroom no place to hang anything and next to a kitchen that you can hear clearly anytime anyone is using it. Some have mentioned a smell to be honest I did not have any issues however in the evening there was a smell of food that probably was from the folks cooking in the common kitchen. Beds were comfortable but with no cover sheet only a comforter room is overall dark wifi was fine and TV. Bathroom was dingy shower curtain was not long enough so puddle of water on floor after each shower sink faucet came off in my hand on first use ceiling fan black all around looks like it has never been cleaned.  

To his credit Maxwell does not really oversell the place in the description and so while it was shabbier than I anticipated if you are traveling on a budget and do not need to spend much time in the room except to sleep the above deficiencies may be tolerable."
3246879,461497533,2019-05-31,241761490,Daniil,Excellent condo with great amenities and convenient location!
7972067,161367848,2017-06-17,14658287,Francesca,It was great that we were able to park our car in the garage. The place is conveniently located--a few miles from/to work. A Target and Lucky market was close by. The bathroom was very large and the bed was very comfortable. 
2486953,281860909,2018-06-25,48722713,Richard,Perfect location beautiful place and outstanding hospitality. If you're coming to SF for any occasion make this place your home-base! Will definitely try to come back whenever I'm in the area again.
918341,25824172,2015-01-26,3475862,John,"I was very pleased with the experience.  Kepa really takes pride in her property and it shows: the unit was amply sized was very clean and tidy.  Kepa was very responsive to questions and made us feel welcome.  

I wish we had more time to spend on the property enjoying the unit and the garden.  We'll be back!"
20979534,298761572,2018-07-29,80612680,Michelle,Varin and Ali are kind and generous hosts with a cozy space. Enjoyed the chats around the kitchen counter top. You get more than a spot to stay you get to befriend 2 beautiful individuals and their lovely dogs. Love the experience and will definitely be reaching out to them whenever am back in town. 
17016637,408591533,2019-02-04,49807943,Anne,Nice cozy place - place was private with nice amenities loved the tea and coffee provided by the host

4902365,128663994,2017-01-26,102897293,Lars,It is a nice hostel in San Francisco. They are really nice guys. Every single night you have events organized by the hostel. So you will met new people over your stay. In the ballroom you can use the instruments and the pool table. The service team of the hostel is very communicative. Overall I enjoyed my stay in the hostel and made a lot of new friends.
3505185,75483262,2016-05-21,58532765,Ceverly,It was a wonderful experience staying at Lynn's place. Great quiet side street. The apartment itself was so cozy and welcoming. I couldn't figure out how to make the cable work so I didn't end up watching any T.V. while I was there which was a good way to unplug anyway. It felt like such a huge space for one person but I loved it. It's really close to great restaurants and shops. I recommend: Squat & Gobble Cafe & Creperie (delicious crepes) Ike's Place (creative sandwiches) Wildcraft Espresso Bar (goat's milk mocha). Really you can find just about anything and everything from food to shops within a short walk. I was alone and felt completely safe. I commuted to work most days which took about 20 mins. to the 22nd Caltrain station. Great weather though it gets chilly at night so be prepared to close the windows or snuggle up. Keep in mind: the stairs are a killer! They are narrow and extremely high so lugging up a bunch of luggage would probably not be something I recommend. I'd also recommend being careful with turning on the hot water. That baby gets hot fast and not just hot...scolding. A little goes a looong way. Overall I would highly recommend Lynn's place as a great place to unwind and explore the Castro and all it has to offer. I could definitely see myself living there. ;-)
8907289,67845155,2016-03-31,25163674,Kristen,Great experience staying with Nick and Lindy! Spacious and the most accommodating. LOOOVE the mission our favorite part of the city! Valencia Street is so close and so fab

By far the greatest host I've stayed with. Personal touches amazing private space beautiful grounds great wifi super SUPER clean. 

I loved my stay. "
8472083,427469356,2019-03-23,151323236,Lorraine,Bina's home is spectacular! Not only was it stocked with every thing we could possibly need for our trip to SF but Bina also provided us with wonderful tips and suggestions to help us explore the area. The location of the home can't be beat and made it very convenient to travel both by bus or by foot.
12981814,99071022,2016-09-03,72177546,Jeremiah,Was a great place to stop in San Fran. Be careful on the parking situation city cleans opposite sides of street every day can be confusing. 
4957143,66371876,2016-03-22,33995755,Michael,This apartment has set the benchmark for the next 20 years of Airbnbing for us. Pre-arrival information was comprehensive accurate and welcoming. We turned up after dark and keys were easy to find and all lights were on even on the terrace where we had our first glass of wine. We immediately felt at home. This was our first experience of Airbnb and I might never stay in a hotel again certainly not in San Francisco. The apartment had everything it was stylish in a Scandinavian way and the bed was possibly the most comfortable ever. The kitchen had all the essentials including freshly ground coffee in the fridge. The location is perfect sandwiched between two very distinct neighbourhoods a block away from a bus stop and 5 minutes walk from some of the best restaurants and shopping in San Francisco and walking distance (for the energetic) from Union Square and Fishermans Wharf. The information file provided by Beth is spot on capturing the essence of the places worth visiting so much so that our daughter resident in the city for nearly a year learned a lot from it. I feel envious of future visitors to this apartment as it's such a great place to stay.
1479666,39374727,2015-07-23,11026167,Julia,We loved the apartment and had a wonderful stay.   This 3 bedroom apartment has lots of charm and plenty of space for a family.  I can't believe how much more space and privacy one gets through Airbnb compared with hotels.  The Hayes Valley neighborhood is safe fun and funky with lots of public transport.  We highly recommend Patty and Tom's place.
2723005,99331480,2016-09-04,23784201,Jean Marc,"Thank you Peggy. 

What a great location. Everything is as accurately described by Peggy who is very easy to deal with and will go the extra mile to help her guests. 

We will stay there when we are back to SFO. "

3486460,18765640,2014-08-31,20488164,Juan Ignacio,Emily has been a great host. I only stayed for one night although she was helpful in everything. The place is very quite excellent for businesses of for vacations. It's all very clean new and in perfect conditions same as the pictures and the overall descriptions states. I strongly recommend everyone Emily's house!
1421671,367870133,2019-01-05,231664475,Jessica,Clean space with everything you need! Toiletries food and drinks are complimentary which was a nice surprise
28280458,469006532,2019-06-13,8333607,Liana,Good location super convenient! Though as with most of the residential in SF no air-conditioning so during my stay it got pretty hot in one of those few odd days that SF was actually really hot.
8565105,131272486,2017-02-11,28976705,Jim,Room was clean but basic. Great location downtown two blocks to subway lots of restaurants shopping. Street noise can be heard at times but not a big issue. Main problem was the really bad Wi-Fi connection in room.
1944564,127215247,2017-01-16,9033739,Michelle,Brian and Florencia's place is SO awesome! It is a unique and interesting 1 bed/1 bath living space inside of Brian's sculpture studio. They helped us get settled and gave us great tips for interesting things to do in the city. Brian even left us with a radio so we could listen to one of his installations in the city! Highly recommend for people who are looking for a unique experience and one-on-one time with a working artist. 
1203172,81423862,2016-06-23,74990808,Anne,Our stay with Rachael and John was wonderful!  They were so helpful on the sights to see transportation and restaurants.  The muffins yogurt and fresh fruit were a perfect way to start our day.  We really appreciated their kindness and hospitality.

19478755,254463121,2018-04-16,182496909,Michelle,It was my first time booking airbnb I was so nervous because the idea of staying at someone else’s home had me a little scared but I loved it! Kathy was amazing. I visited San Francisco with my sister and Kathy definitely made us feel comfortable from the moment we stepped foot inside her home. Her neighborhood is peaceful & safe at night. She welcomes you home everytime you come back from outside she serves breakfast with amazing coffee! Kathy also gives very good directions and knows where all the fun places to visit are. She’s just the best!
2926901,31008772,2015-04-30,2550904,Julian,All good. It's a very nice hotel. Just some weird noises at night from time to time. Not human caused rather some wrong piping or so. Wifi not always working.

4510968,45081251,2015-08-31,34273204,Paola,bilocale molto molto carino luminoso e accogliente! un living con angolo cottura tavolo e divano letto una camera matrimoniale spaziosa da cui si accede al bagno al ripostiglio e al piccolissimo giardinetto sul retro della casa. Ingresso comune all'abitazione privata di Anna (che non abbiamo mai incontrato ma che ci ha fatto trovare un cartello con la scritta 'WELCOME' sulla porta fatta dal figlio di 4 anni - carini!). quartiere tranquillo e molto vicino alla stazione BART e comunque a circa mezz'oretta di taxi dal Pier 39. nella zona consigliamo CUP per un'ottima colazione! 
9225,40169782,2015-07-28,39042031,Betsy,"
The apartment exceeded our hopes and expectation: we were absolutely delighted by it and by Gae's exuberant inspiring being. As contemporary art lovers we felt that we were staying in an art gallery as well as feeling very welcomed. We only stayed for one night but enjoyed exploring Potrero Hill. We definitely hope to spend more time here!"
13084734,130404368,2017-02-05,112156469,Alexis,The host was so hospitable and thoughtful! There was a bottle of wine and a nice snack waiting after our flight was delayed 3 hours. This was our first experience with Airbnb. There was also a list of restaurants and cafes in the nearby area! Thank you we really enjoyed our stay! 
13603043,415483936,2019-02-22,91648988,Lanie,This was a fabulous place to stay  -- quiet easy access to city attractions (1 block from a good bus line) 3 blocks from the grocery store speedy replies from Shal friendly neighborhood beautiful apartment with everything we needed.  We'd definitely stay again!  Shal is great!
15179182,224319487,2018-01-02,53052298,Emma,Communication from Lauren and Chris was really great before our stay -  we didn't get to meet them  as we were out most of the time.  The appt has been nicely accessorised but wasn't super clean - the dishwasher was full of dirty dishes when we arrived and we had to wash up cups and glasses before we could have a drink. There are condiments and dressings tea coffee which was thoughtful - although the creamer in the fridge was off! The fridge is really noisy during the night and we didn't like walking on the real animal skin rug - so we put it away while we were there.  Overall the appt is nice and our boys liked the basketball courts in the park around the corner.  We saw a couple of neighbours who were all really friendly too.
25547908,368731110,2019-01-07,88826271,Kimberly,We picked Jenny’s place for its location. It’s really close to Ocean Beach and right off Golden Gate Park—super nice if your time is limited and you want to see a variety of things in the city. The place was clean and Jenny responded quickly to our booking. Everything went smoothly.
17652643,205275619,2017-10-21,27105391,Robert,"Coolest place with the coolest host in Mission. Jeana went above and beyond to ensure my stay was nothing short of perfect. Between doing my laundry making me a healthy breakfast after a long night and being extremely warm and welcoming I cannot recommend Jeana and her home enough. 

Beautiful Victorian home on a safe quiet street just steps away from all the action of the mission.  Was the perfect place to rest and unplug after a long day. 

If I ever come through San Francisco again; if available there is no other place I'd rather stay. 

Thanks Jeana!"

4838843,227723939,2018-01-15,792307,Oggie,Great apartment / flat to experience what San Francisco has to offer. You can see a bit of the Golden gate bridge walk to presidio shop/dine/drink down Chestnut or Union Street. Apartment has all the amenities (dishwasher garbage disposal laundry etc) while also keep the unique SF touches.

The king suite is perfect size for 2 people. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is GORGEOUS. Kelly left very detailed instructions with everything you'd need to know about the room and was quick to respond when needed. Check in and out is super easy and the location is within walking distance to some really cute restaurants and shops! We took Lyfts to all the tourist destinations (golden gate bridge fisherman's ward pier 33 AT&T park etc.) and nothing was more than a $15-20 ride away. Even though the location is very central and easy to get everywhere it is still a nice low-key neighborhood with lots of privacy. We spent most of our time out and about as we happened to be here during the craziest heat wave San Francisco has had in years and the room got extremely hot being on the 3rd floor. I know that is super rare for SF but a warning for others just in case it happens again :) Other than that absolutely loved our stay here and would definitely return. Thank you Kelly!
277339,3729896,2013-03-09,4857548,Bailey,Me and my boyfriend decided to stay at Natalie and Paige's beautiful Garden studio for anniversary and I must say it was all we could of asked for and more! The apartment was very clean and neat and the Donnells were very sweet and accommodating hosts with great tips for the area. We will definitely be back soon! Thanks so much!
4026354,300660270,2018-08-02,17429390,Ken,Exactly as advertised.  A bit out of the way for touristy things but it was a good place to stay for the family an Candy is a great host.
4902855,133182173,2017-02-20,116586340,Michael,When I checked in I was welcomed in and escorted to my room. The room is pretty nice. It was clean and organized I felt at home for the night.
21070256,258208486,2018-04-28,49628594,Nitya,Bob's is a great place located outside the hustle of the main city. The neighbourhood is scenic and perfect. The room and hospitality is outstanding and our personal interactions with him and his family were great. We thoroughly enjoyed staying with him and highly recommend him. He also has two great cats and we had fun spending time playing with one of them (the other one is shy but really cute too!). Would love to stay with Bob again when next in SFO. And if you were wondering about the connectivity to the main city public transport is available right around the corner and Uber/Lyft are easy to find too.
21233544,240694381,2018-03-05,156717873,Andriy,Cozy clean private close to ocean Would stay again. Recommended!!!
11531859,321191293,2018-09-09,35021808,Patrick,Very cozy comfy clean and a fantastic location! Right by the L train and the 29 bus for easy travel around the city not to mention the fun and pretty Outer Sunset area.
12025717,205729140,2017-10-22,153285795,Guillermo,Very accessible to all areas of the city!
35340000,547661339,2019-10-15,74064193,Victoria,"A gorgeous place that is huge in a nice area! The host was super helpful. I would definitely stay again. Its bigger than the description even says in a safe clean building which is rare for San Francisco. Very modern and clean. Nice parking.

Do not recommend for those that are not ok with lots of stairs or not tech-savvy. There's a bunch of IoT stuff which is was super neato. There's an iPad in every room and the TV and everything is all set up and easy to use but could see my grandma being very confused."
2592518,508318999,2019-08-12,246396806,Béatrice,Pas de possibilité de faire de lessive pas de possibilité de parking une salle de bain inexistante (un placard avec baignoire et WC lavabo dans le couloir). Le reste est correct si vous aimez monter les escaliers. Location chère pour un confort sommaire.
18873809,429054326,2019-03-26,144034094,Anthony,Great apartment and great hosts. Highly recommended.
16018565,426664412,2019-03-21,5616567,Martin,Nice location in SF nearby Market street and financial district. Very clean and nice bathroom.
32770430,466980398,2019-06-09,32145110,Dana,This place is a great for the value! Clean lots of snacks  and the beds were comfortable. It was perfect for our family trip to the city.
515524,65224410,2016-03-12,49569900,Caragh,The first moment we stepped into Benita's apartment we could not believe how comfortable and beautiful it was.  Everything about it was fresh pretty and welcoming.  The natural light especially was a treat.  The kitchen was well equipped modern stylish and efficient.  The living room was airy tastefully appointed and separated from the bedroom by two sliding wooden doors.  The gas stove for heat was charming. The bed was comfy with a nice quilt.  We were a little concerned that the street would be loud but though the traffic was busy the cars didn't honk and the pedestrians weren't rowdy.  We closed the bedroom doors and that did the trick for sleeping.  Parking was sometimes tricky.  Our tips: head uphill to find open spots and don't park next to any parks overnight as vandals are known to break car windows there. Benita was easy to communicate with and super nice.  We had our travel plans affected by family matters and Benita was incredibly generous about letting us shift our dates with very little notice at no extra cost. I'm grateful. This was a great Airbnb experience. I highly recommend this apartment. I would return in a heartbeat.
91957,976552,2012-03-06,780739,Paul,Beautiful place in a beautiful part of town. Super welcoming and friendly hosts. Would highly recommend and plan to stay there again when I'm back in SF!
209514,7631791,2013-09-27,8854110,Jorge,"Great Location near to public transportation
Very clean and quiet!!!"
7067681,104816219,2016-09-28,90547572,Nicole,If you want to save money + meet people from all over the world + have a good time every night then this is the place for you. Everyone was very nice and I will definitely stay here the next time I'm in SF.
3759246,169513503,2017-07-12,85588590,平嘉,I would not recommend this place to other travelers. It was dirty. Dust was covered all over the place and I am pretty sure the bedding was not changed because there were some hair from private body on the sheet and the pillow smelled awfully like fresh sweat. Please note that to get to the room you have to walk through a ratty garage covered with dumped items which was not specified. Plus the infant upstairs can be annoying. 
3271517,416619286,2019-02-24,2308777,Joanna,Great location very clean and stylish. Make sure to read carefully— rental is only for the bedroom and bathroom not the kitchen and living room even though you walk through.
752607,159114368,2017-06-09,30786431,Alicia,Lily's place is nice. I definitely recommend it to others coming to town for business or pleasure. The host communicated really well. I would most definitely use them again in the future when a needed presented itself :)
1778650,503352741,2019-08-05,70449042,Lucas,"Appartement agréable quoiqu'un peu petit pour 4 personnes.
Plutôt bien placé. Ludmila fait preuve de petites attentions agréables."
16426353,289629064,2018-07-12,190428963,Joe,Clean no frills 
6938818,54318159,2015-11-18,28268474,Susanna,Harris and his family were great hosts. Even had our room ready for check in as soon as possible after learning we were arriving earlier than the available check in time.  ALWAYS reliped very promptly with any questions we may have. Had a great time staying here aside from the amazing views and close walking distance to the beach and park. :) The city was easy to get to with one bus ride away.
18567743,559787951,2019-11-04,241459624,Mark,Charlie is a charming host that is quite interested in marking sure you have complete knowledge of the area and can plan accordingly.  Place was spotless.  Access involves steep stairs and you may wish to consider this depending upon your level of fitness.  Public transit is readily accessible.
9650878,532972982,2019-09-20,97842969,Kate,Carl’s wanderlust room was lovely. Huge window that overlooked the quiet backyard. We had a car and Carl accommodated us beyond what you would expect for the city. Our checkin instructions were thorough and detailed and there were so many nice suggestions for activities. Although only here for one night I would definitely stay here again.
24685,90829646,2016-08-02,6124291,Anupa,Alison is an amazing host everything provided was as listed. The location of the apartment was perfect for me. 
3309722,30895475,2015-04-28,509614,Bryce,The studio was great and the views are amazing. Cliff was very helpful and even made a new copy of a key when it was being a little troublesome. The location is great and easily accessible to tons of places via the J train.
413663,2817254,2012-11-05,150771,Wanda,I needed a place to stay in Noe Valley near my daughter and was lucky to have found Alex and his beautiful quiet condo.     The condo was immaculate and had everything you could expect.    Alex was so helpful through the entire process.    The best was visiting with Alex and Mara in the morning which was when they magically appeared!     This was my first airbnb experience and I can only hope the rest will be this perfect!
24539004,262115556,2018-05-07,117174579,Matija,Great and clean apartment nice neighbourhood and great price.
3271517,461021256,2019-05-30,7241255,Nancy,the location is fabulous. you will sleep in an amazing bed with gorgeous linens in a quiet neighborhood with a lovely french restaurant a block away — and yet you will be within walking distance of all that san francisco has to offer. (and if you dont walk— dont worry an uber/lyft will pick you up in minutes). enjoy california. in style.
8763620,92088492,2016-08-07,59437096,Hannah,It was a great time at treat ave i enjoyed it a lot. The guys are so nice and helpful. I can definitely recommend it. 
6335352,150858224,2017-05-09,120166450,Belinda,"A beautiful home with high end amentities and very clean. In a quiet neighborhood which is lovely but also has a  village like shopping/restaurant precinct 
within walking distance which is really cool. Would highly recommend staying here it made our stay in Sf all that more enjoyable. Vladi was also a great host! "
14166343,165720157,2017-07-02,72730270,Joshua,Carol and her home are amazing. The home is truly a little sanctuary in the city. Communicating with Carol as well as check in and check out were all very easy. I would stay at Carol's home again as well as recommend it to any friends visiting the city. 
32025820,427008029,2019-03-22,54565597,Matthew,"This is my second time staying at Guang’s place in San Fran. He is close to the airport and close to downtown. The house is very clean and he cares about you having a good time in San Fran. This place is great for work because the 14x bus stop is basically in front of his house and goes directly into the financial district from there.
I plan on booking this place again for my next trip. Location cleanliness price and host are all great."
4654218,141945272,2017-04-05,51990927,Isabelle,"Julian's home was the most authentic stay I have experienced in Airbnb so far. Julian cares so much about people that the house becomes a hub of happy guests. The room I had was spacious clean and the view so beautiful at night. In the common space everyone has an allocated food and bathroom space that makes the house like your own. 
I couldn't recommend more this place and I wish I could have stayed longer!"
4518031,470994679,2019-06-16,260283770,Alivia,Great and fun place to stay!
34903588,542854345,2019-10-06,27866555,Kate,We had an excellent stay at Suna's Sunnyside home. Having such a kid friendly space with books toys and craft supplies was a total blessing! We also loved the apples snacks and coffee. thank you!
657121,3368372,2013-01-18,4597895,Brian,Trevor and Nicole were great to stay with and the place was perfect.  Great location and they were very hospitable.
21385697,508988317,2019-08-13,132479025,Polonkai,Had everything thought out everything you could ever need nice comfy big and clean and has an amazing view from the study!
1077444,423333372,2019-03-13,6289836,Carol,Great budget option - location suited our needs for visiting family . Large room  kitchen and living room access . Communication with Andrea was great.
494111,262687686,2018-05-09,31826287,Stephanie,Vivian's place is exactly as described and even bigger than we expected. We were 3 adults and an infant. Vivian was gracious to offer set up of a playpen for us - super nice! This place is very close to a bus stop that will take you straight to Union Square in about 30-40 minute (comes every 10-15 minutes) - very convenient. It's about a 20 minute walk to Golden Gate Park. There are lots of restaurants in the surrounding area to choose from. Lovely and quiet neighbourhood. As other guests have mentioned there are kids in the upstairs apartment that are early risers so if you are sensitive to noise probably not the right place for you. However we were awake early and usually out of the apartment before noon so it really was not a bother to us. Vivian was a great communicator and everything we needed we found in her apartment. Would definitely book her place again should we ever have a chance to visit San Francisco again.
13687128,514743430,2019-08-21,253935335,Stefan,Daniel's place is squeaky clean well located and the patio right outside your door is a great place to read a book and relax. There's also a bus stop 50 feet from the building which is very convenient. Daniel is a welcoming host. He has prepared the place very well for guests and was receptive to all of my requests. As you probably have realized by now finding housing in SF is a daunting task. I seriously recommend considering this place.
25870802,428710409,2019-03-25,32132402,Kristen,Brad and Roberta’s place was clean welcoming and comfortable. They offer all the toiletries snacks and amenities that you would need for your visit. It’s also located in a beautiful neighborhood with easy parking and walking distance from Twin Peaks!
3793831,198850190,2017-09-30,35409165,Michael,This place was just what we needed. Great location in walking distance from so many nice restaurants and easy public transit.
795254,161319301,2017-06-17,11365287,Rafael,Her amazing place is the same looked at pictures.  Clean beautiful and cozy.  Jane is the most friendly host always happy to give directions and best options to get where you want to go.  The place is so well located close to bus stations walking distance to Haight st and Market st.  Thanks Jane you are the best!
59381,174101631,2017-07-24,66035362,Jeremy,Very clean apartment close to the fisherman's wharf and Lombard street; good communication with Bill.
16134193,465389956,2019-06-07,21961352,Rick,Very nice apartment extremely quiet area. Great place to walk around. Would happily stay here again.
2397858,291436094,2018-07-15,95558050,Angela,Suzy's home is absolutely beautiful with amazing amenities. Suzy was very thoughtful and provided us bagels and put fresh flowers throughout the house! The place was clean and spacious. The bed were comfy. Her home was the best airbnb I've stayed in so far.
3416013,188258319,2017-08-28,95018160,YiYang(Hunt),I absolutely loved staying at Emily's place! She was friendly and knowledgeable about everything in Boston. The location is fantastic. You're closed to so many fine restaurants; public transportation is also easy to get to. I would strongly recommend people to stay with her and will definitely come back again if I would to visit San Francisco in the future.
7785897,506534111,2019-08-10,144645907,Anelisy,Achei um pouco estranho a entrada do Airbnb ser pela garagem da casa. Garagem bem bagunçada com coisas pessoais da proprietária. A geladeira ficava na garagem também. Tudo bem estranho. A localização também não é tão boa assim. Fique no local se realmente precisar economizar.
14596029,289161122,2018-07-11,189691897,Russell,Only got to meet Rob briefly because of his work schedule. But his wife Becka would usually be in during the mornings and evenings to help with anything you need. She was extremely pleasant to talk to and suggested many places of interests to me during my stay. I slept on the couch in the living room which was comfortable enough (there's only so much you can expect of couches) but being in the company of their two lovely dogs more than made up for it! Overall a very pleasant stay!
2221057,66447534,2016-03-22,53482978,Christina,Clean spacious private - this place exceeded my expectations. Both Blythe and Michael were so welcoming when I arrived with my friend and family! We arrived pretty late in the evening and Blythe made sure we found their place as well as a parking spot. As we settled in they made sure we were comfortable in the space and provided lots of helpful tips for things to do throughout our stay in San Francisco. I would highly recommend booking with this lovely couple - I will definitely stay with them again if we ever go back!
32021078,427065430,2019-03-22,205770818,一舟,Sasha and her boyfriend are really nice people. They provided plenty of food in the refrigerator as breakfast as well as snacks and fruits. The house is clean and well-decorated. The location is near the golden gate park and the neighborhood is safe so I can get there easily after the nightlife at California Acadamy of Science.  It is worth it though!
774323,70856599,2016-04-21,64642900,Judith,"It was our first trip to SF. We wanted to stay at a place that was central convenient comfortable and somewhere that would give us a great first impression of the city. My husband and I are sooo glad we chose to stay at Jan's after looking through many other listings! 

Jan let us leave our bags two hours before check-in time and made us feel right at home! She was warm funny and helped give us suggestions as first-timers in SF. Thriller the cat was THE most adorable co-host greeting us at the top of the stairs and accompanying us in the room when we were home. Extremely therapeutic for animal lovers!

The spacious room was exactly as shown in the listing and we were happy to have our own ensuite bathroom (something many other Airbnb's in the area didn't have) with a heated towel rack! We saw that Jan had thoughtfully put SF travel books in the room for guests to read. We slept very well something we were grateful for after long days out. 

We also loved that the famous Tartine bakery was only a 2-min walk away and Dolores Park was down the road. The location of Jan's home made it very easy for us to walk out grab breakfast everyday explore the city and do touristy things (we chose to use the Lyft app for transportation). 

We would definitely stay here again! Thanks for being a part of our memorable stay in SF Jan!"
15985008,490536429,2019-07-18,122544013,Trent,Great communication easy access to the city and clean
21625713,472050506,2019-06-18,43391543,Magally,Super clean and comfy even for very allergic people like myself. Thank you for being so thoughtful.
1356129,162607391,2017-06-21,61873687,Nikki,This is in a great location for those looking to get a more local feel of the city. It is close to some beautiful parks that have great views of the San Francisco skyline.  It was also really close to the BART and some Muni lines which made going in to the city so easy. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The hosts have a great manual with all the information you could possibly need to maximize your stay. I would definitely reccomend this suite to anyone looking to visit SF. 
9431997,112626411,2016-11-06,51417246,Kevin,Pete was really responsive and quick with communication! I rented a car so his apartment was great for parking. It's in a nice quiet part but really close to all the main attractions. The room was really clean and the bed was super comfy and he had everything set out from towels to other stuff such as shampoo. Would totally stay again!
1261074,426351278,2019-03-20,72029540,ｼﾞｭﾝﾚｲ,I’m very lucky to find such a nice place to stay for my first visit to SF. I’m sure I’ll stay here again when I come to SF next time.

568161,405858799,2019-01-27,118049244,Lauren,Beth and her husband were superb hosts! They both were very hospitable from the beginning and their dogs were super friendly and quiet. The location is close to a BART station and a handful of coffee shops as well as a market. The room and bathroom were very clean with the appropriate amenities.  Overall I had a great stay and would highly recommend this room for anyone visiting SF!
7547105,160079755,2017-06-12,70290887,Joe,The location is awesome close to the arts palace the bay front and local bus stops into the city. Although the room is small it has everything you need and is cosy. There is also access to the courtyard so if you open up the doors your room is huge! Diana is a very accommodating host helped me out with bike drop offs etc. I would definitely stay there again. 
9910056,173745810,2017-07-23,20283790,Andrew,David was a great host and has a beautiful space. The location is amazing and the communication was on point. Thanks David! 
24685,11173371,2014-03-24,5993666,Rhys,My time at Alison's was simply great. The bedroom was more than enough and the bed itself was especially comfy! Alison always helped me with my day to day plans providing invaluable insight to the area. When our paths crossed at home she always asked how my day was which led to some great chats. The breakfasts were also wonderful. I felt right at home. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this listing to anyone!
20450156,437574306,2019-04-14,34990609,Tina,Quiet and clean. Great place to stay. Can't recommend more.
6092596,311685985,2018-08-21,14172704,Nancy,This suite is in an excellent location. The room is not large but it is charming. There are thoughtful touches in the space. I would definitely recommend it for a short stay in the Mission.
4718531,433501146,2019-04-06,8382505,Alex,My stay at Mike’s place went perfectly well. The beautiful building as well as the room itself has a Victorian-vintage touch that is really enjoyable. Mike was friendly and explained all that I needed to know was available for questions also he’s been really respectful of my privacy. The location is quiet and convenient for sightseeing especially if you feel like wandering around Haight-Ashbury. Don’t hesitate to stay there !
22104228,224932596,2018-01-04,93027588,Róisín,Central cosy place. Close to everything
585225,38475348,2015-07-16,24971696,Silvia,Gabriels Studio really looked as described. Even if it is pretty small it is very bright and comfortable and is enough space for two people. The neighbours were also very friendly and when we came Gabriel provided a bottle red wine  and some really tasting chocolate. Noe Valley where the stutio is located is a nice district with many little shops bars and restaurants. We enjoyed our stay here.
2274353,500756226,2019-08-02,277480176,Jessica,We had a great stay in the sweet apartment. The beds were comfy everything was clean and it was handy to have a kitchen. The bus was a 5 minute walk and we found a good coffee shop and yummy tacos nearby. Highly recommended!!

269371,309798255,2018-08-18,103144603,Ben,"Matthew has a very beautiful quiet space in a charming part of SF. He's a very kind attentive and thoughtful host!

During my time there (I was there for 5 weeks) he gave me several nice travel tips of small local sights to see. Whenever we were both home at the same time we also found ourselves having long fun discussions about anything from new movies to art to politics to cats. Speaking of which his cat Ghia is quite adorable (and easy to scare since she's deaf.)

If you're looking for a nice well decorated place to stay in SF this would be it!"
22826843,348390151,2018-11-13,47751548,Paul,"Just Perfect 

Victor prises himself on offering a 5 star experience - well it is very much deserved.

The place has been recently refurbished with style the room is spacious and sparkling clean Victor added many thoughtful touches in the room and the bathroom.

To top it all Victor is extremely responsive accommodating and kind: a true legend.

Highly recommended!"
21880287,259831590,2018-05-02,121171151,Anna,Wenn man Michael und seiner Wohnung 10 Sterne geben könnte - wir würden es tun. Ab der ersten Minute haben wir uns bei ihm willkommen und sehr gut aufgehoben gefühlt. Seine Wohnung ist noch toller ausgestattet als auf den Bildern zu sehen sehr sauber und die Lage ist unschlagbar und einmalig. Michaels aufmerksame und zuvorkommende Art hat uns zu den schönsten und unentdecktesten Orten des Viertels geführt und seine Tipps haben uns die Trips durch die Stadt sehr erleichtert. Die Ausstattung des Zimmers (insbesondere das Bett) sind sehr komfortabel. Das mit sehr viel Liebe zubereitete Frühstück am Morgen ist unschlagbar.

12115392,82702350,2016-06-29,880344,Rix,Our stay was short. Ethan was very courteous and respectful. He even helped us to coordinate our activities for the day tour.  
7073115,151400197,2017-05-12,7317202,Dasha,We really enjoyed our stay during our last 2 nights in San Francisco! Thank you Isaac & Doug!
21000319,419799234,2019-03-04,62584985,Erika,Great open notably curated space with a beautiful kitchen and amazing outdoor area encased in the center of the ground floor (with garden lights!). Tall ceilings with a creative style throughout. It was perfect for working remotely entertaining a small group of friends and celebrating a special occasion! Chester and Summer were responsive and very hospitable. Location was perfect - walking distance to sightglass for coffee farmhouse Thai flour + water and tartine manufactory for interesting meals. Fell in love with a designer newsstand right next to Tartine.
1043282,222438967,2017-12-29,128622592,Evan,This was the best experience we have ever had with an Airbnb hands down. The check in was smooth and everything you needed to know was laid out for you in your room. We will cross our fingers that John’s place is available when we plan our next trip to San Francisco.
13362637,113974068,2016-11-14,65191546,Peng,非常满意的一次住宿体验房屋很干净房屋内应有的设施也特别全｡地理位置靠近金门公园环境很棒也很安静安全｡下次再到旧金山旅行依旧会选择这里｡
21219237,274272144,2018-06-08,20399194,Sarah,Lovely apartment in a pleasant neighbourhood just a few minutes walk from some nice restaurants and also for public transport options to get into the city (tip - take the J tram it’s slower than the BART but really scenic). Grace was really helpful and welcoming and we were able to leave our bags after checking out and collect them for our evening flight. Parking was easy - free and just a couple of blocks away. All in all a great Airbnb experience in a fabulous city.
130805,11277346,2014-03-28,10947546,Ted,"We had the pleasure of staying with Sue and Mike Lebeck for two weeks in
March. It was a wonderful experience from the moment Sue opened the door!
Our apartment was very clean and bright with sunshine. All amenities were available including laundry facilities.
The neighborhood is awesome with lots of restaurants shopping and corner stores for whatever you may want/need! Long walks were an everyday must!
Sue and Mike are delightful people who were always there to greet you with a smile at the end of the day. 
We are looking forward to many trips to San Francisco as our daughter and her family live there and we hope we will be able to repeat our stay at the Lebeck's.

3506164,96862760,2016-08-24,13950941,Romain,A really pleasant place to stay a few days in San Francisco and very nice hosts who make sure your stay is as good as possible.
4965866,56841485,2015-12-19,37137749,Daryl,Quiet clean and comfortable.  This was a great place to stay.
15342398,210473019,2017-11-09,58082995,Palen,Great option during the Dreamforce Conference
2783251,229298263,2018-01-22,9090757,Amy,It is a downstairs apartment.  The windows make it light.  The patio is great.  
1056844,12360355,2014-04-29,94226,Candice,Chantal was a great hostess. Very respectable and was able to accommodate me via other means when her place was full. I would def stay here again
17606766,289188723,2018-07-11,33726385,Grégory,Cheap and clean beach  calm !!! perfect
8869066,192104116,2017-09-09,53973444,Will,It was great!
4106442,40476560,2015-07-31,37156098,Eric,The host was great very responsive from the start and wonderfully informative about where to go and what to see when we got there. The place's best feature is the private outdoor patio. We spent hours here between meetings and trips about town. When we were about town we could have spent even more time in the Mission District. Excellent location!
5572169,68481526,2016-04-05,44682301,Cady,Our stay was wonderful and Alison was the perfect host! Upon our arrival she greeted us and showed us the room which included plenty of water and coffee. The location was perfect and the view was amazing. Such a beautiful way to wake up! There is a great private deck area where you can enjoy your morning coffee or a glass of wine at sunset. She also provides recommendations on restaurants and activities in the area. Would highly recommend!
1767543,11665185,2014-04-11,12776435,Dustin,Talk about a secret cottage! The rooms are located behind all of the houses and far off the street which make for a peaceful and quiet respite from the bustle of San Francisco. Everything is in great shape and clean and has all been recently updated. The reserved parking spot can definitely be a lifesaver if you plan on staying out later too. I would definitely check out Matching Half or Fly if your interested in great little places you can walk to. 
7343245,101874524,2016-09-15,465290,Sam,Great beautiful home with lots of charm and tastefully decorated. Our group of four loved our stay and it was perfect for us. 
259622,347070424,2018-11-10,16182888,Chris,Great place to stay =) Make sure you bring some slides or flip flops for the showers!
13464987,195536985,2017-09-19,135045308,Thomas,"Connie is a very friendly host gave good  recommendations for exploring the city. Of course you have your own private room and you can use the kitchen to make breakfast (coffee tea and toast included!).
The bed is fine the cats are also friendly (but they are not allowed in your room so don't worry). The house is near Castro but it's quiet there. I felt comfortable there."
30212422,455492162,2019-05-19,2914132,Kuo,Awesome place accurately described.  Nearby to so many great things in SF.  We loved it!
20093004,219520695,2017-12-17,3344583,Javier And Mike,"Staying with Aaron and Terrance was a treat! The apartment is nice and centrally located near public transport and any needs that may arise (groceries pharmacy bar etc.). We were warmly greeted upon arrival (thanks Luke for the beverages at your cafe across the street!) and the self-check in was super easy. 

The apartment was nice and clean and had what we needed. We attempted to cook brekkky on the first morning but having an antique stove on site there was an issue but our hosts responded quickly and came by to resolve the issue while we were gone. We were able to make a meal the next morning. 

The house had all the amenities necessary to feel at home. We had kids with us and it was perfect (especially making paper airplanes and using the long hallway as a runway!)

All in all a great time and a good experience. I look forward to another time at The Noe Apartment!"
6749412,110994327,2016-10-29,4539725,Perry,"Chris and Daniela have a great apartment with a view of Sutro tower. There's ample free parking and it's easy to get to the highways south and into he city. 

The kitchen is updated with a great stove there was some food and drinks in the fridge and Chris even contacted us on street sweeping day to make sure we didn't get a ticket. 

It's a comfortable stay and the communication was just right. We stayed there with a 10 month old and it wasn't hard to make it feel safe for him. We'd stay again. "
467507,284618044,2018-07-01,49771342,Ashleigh,"Good location - neat clean and tidy with well equiped kitchen  that made us feel like we were at home. It was  short of nothing.

We liked the personal touches that like the butter milk juice & wine etc. that Jennifer left for us  on arrival ... this was really good.

We also liked the area and felt like a local using the Muni buses Bart  and the local laundromat. 

We really enjoyed staying at her place and highly recommend it.

Ashleigh & Marion"
17982304,417933431,2019-02-28,90422967,Jessica,Nice backyard super clean and great bathroom amenities. Would definitely stay again!
21295261,417913491,2019-02-28,92061560,Siomara,This place is fantastic! Expect exactly what the description says and more! Dayne was a great host and gave us suggestions of things to do as well as transportation options. Would definitely stay here again if I come back to the area and recommend anyone to come and stay here as well!
35466895,552907341,2019-10-22,63724139,Mandy,Amazing place! Wonderful hosts! We hope to return and reap the benefits of their slice of heaven in SF.
27729286,439270424,2019-04-18,29723182,Gert,Stylish place in a hip neighborhood. Very well located for local restaurants with two great coffee shops just around the corner.
33942157,550453443,2019-10-18,299816542,Nik,"I wanted to stay two extra days in San Fransisco. Not only did I find them the day before they let me into my room early. I don't think it is standard but very helpful with our situation. Was able to get everything in my room and then go on my merry way. Exploring the rest of this beautiful city. It was very centrally located as well as by the Bart. Just a short ride from much of downtown San Fran. Thank you again.
Sincerely 
Nik"
17944621,334373483,2018-10-08,210202117,Luiz Henrique,Um lugar legal e com transporte público bem próximo.
23550791,403434578,2019-01-20,10797806,Pratik,"The place is sparkling clean and is modern in all the aspects. Sat & Garland are very welcoming hosts. We stayed at this place directly after an international flight with a LOT of luggage. They helped us put our luggage in a secured place during our stay because of which we were able to use our room the fullest.

The best part was Netflix mini snacks bread cereals coffee and awesome hosts. Will stay here in future too."
5217164,245284830,2018-03-21,105771785,Brittnee,Dale’s place was wonderful! Exceptionally clean and relatively close to everything without being smack dab in the middle of the city. He offered clean towels rags soap lotion and a host of other toiletries for those who may have forgotten. He also offered local tips for us when we needed some suggestions. WiFi and cable tv was available  ( an older modeled tv with no HDMI port but still worked perfectly). This was an overall exceptional experience and I’d recommend this place to everyone! Thanks Dale!
9650878,305101210,2018-08-10,19539666,Tina,Amazing location in a fun neighborhood. 
1615158,121914567,2016-12-19,56943112,Ed,Laura was a great and accommodating host and the local area is almost surreally serene and beautiful!
4372435,96596097,2016-08-23,2592127,Cavy,We really enjoyed staying at Mike's apartment which was clean and well stocked in a safe neighborhood.  It was great to have a parking spot in the driveway and the Muni L line going to SF downtown.  We would love to visit again.  
980783,106764520,2016-10-08,36634314,Kerrie,Best Airbnb I've stayed in. Excellent place very quiet easy in and out. I will definitely stay here again. 
10437411,142314733,2017-04-07,7836816,Alice,Everything was clean and as advertised - a very enjoyable stay. Thank you!
17343208,147268624,2017-04-25,55026656,Sarah,This simple space is centrally located and clean. I was traveling for business and unable to hang out but would recommend for people who are looking to interact with their hosts; everyone seemed incredibly kind. If you're looking for quiet and solitude you should probably consider a different place.
15769324,152878077,2017-05-18,3602768,Dor And Tamar,Splendid 
12037978,123973312,2016-12-31,4712837,Angelique,Perfectly cozy and great location for our family.  We had our 2 young children (under 6) with us and all went smoothly.  Parking was never a problem and the neighborhood was nice and quiet.  And what an amazing view!  We also loved being near the Esmerelda slide park and having 2 sets of stairs on either side of us to get down to Mission Ave.  As well as being close to the Safeway grocery store - super convenient!  We'd definitely stay here again!  
14990478,348414894,2018-11-13,18332914,Louise,Great location on a quiet neighborhood street. Easy to find and easy parking. Good for a nights stay. Excellent communication from Eddie.
1392204,56615985,2015-12-15,22667458,Katharine,Dee was a truly delightful host! She was communicative warm and full of information about local places to eat. Her home is a treasure and the neighborhood lovely.
14654471,129699253,2017-02-01,54801623,Lauren,Comfortable and affordable for a short term stay in SF. Everything is neat and clean. The garage has been converted into guest quarters though so don't expect to be able to cook complex meals and lounge on a sofa. That's ok though because you should be out and about exploring the city! Ernest was very friendly and responds quickly to messages. Only downside was the thin walls so you could easily hear other guests. The neighborhood is nice but a decent walk to restaurants and shops. Overall a good place to stay!
8005452,313600733,2018-08-25,121116269,Urmila,Great location. Close to everything.
8869066,50999060,2015-10-16,17400162,Michel & Janske,We had A great stay at Andrews. The place is in A great neighbourhood walking distance from 24th. The room was clean and we could enter the backyard from our room. By the time we stayed there wasn't yet a key so we had to go through the garage door which opened quite loudly. But Andrew was busy getting a key made so by this time it is probably done. Andrew provided everything we needed and we would stay again.
19813532,472371123,2019-06-19,269779308,Julio,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8763366,112331450,2016-11-05,102147202,Donald,It was great Duncan is a great host and goes beyond the call of duty to assist and make you feel at home.
4632133,25472365,2015-01-17,5658655,Jesse,"Never having stayed in a smaller Inn (hotel) in SF like this so I was slightly concerned. When I arrived I was satisfied with the cleanliness the grounds and the helpful staff. Parking is tight but off the street in a well lit camera protected location which you can view from your hotel room. The staff oversees who comes in and out as well so that was good.

Maid service was nice and did an expected job on the room each day with fresh towels and made bed.  My room came with a small fridge microwave and a blow dryer. Smallish LCD TV with cable although unknown how many channels because I just left it on MTV while I was there.

My only complaint would be the small details such as: Handles missing from dresser drawers unmatching furniture shower knob that fell off lose toilet seat etc. Everything worked but with those small attention to details being looked over it brings it down to 4 stars.

All in all I was satisfied. Was quiet enough even though it was near Van Ness was clean felt safe car was protected and all the necessities of a Hotel were met. Price was right too (99). Will rent again."
900393,50739466,2015-10-14,3565783,Jade,Lovely home away from home - and very prompt and helpful responses (communicating entirely via email).   We had a lovely stay.
15005046,135184469,2017-03-03,58490460,Joseph,This is a great apartment space not too close and not too far from the busy downtown area. Irina and Gregory are excellent hosts
3257886,414790716,2019-02-20,168976624,Sandra,Great location wonderful friendly and helpful hosts.
779109,240691036,2018-03-05,2783104,Avery,Daniel was a great host! The apartment was spotless and very convenient. Daniel was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area and a host of other topics.
11023703,409788364,2019-02-08,10244054,Marine,Our stay was absolutely delightful. The room is clean lots of equipments. Decoration is very pretty the location is perfect for a quiet stay close to a big city. The communication was easy and efficient. We recommend 100% !
16975571,286213947,2018-07-05,34050413,Jeffrey,Allyson and Carie’s place was clean stylish and comfortable with phenomenal views and in a great location. It made for a perfect jumping off point for our adventures in San Francisco.
10437411,89133866,2016-07-27,14007120,Tamsin,We had a fantastic time here. The location is amazing - on a peaceful pretty street. but still really close to all the action - and the building itself is beautiful and so is the apartment. San Francisco is a beautiful city and we were sad to leave. Chip was a great host and we really enjoyed chatting with him and appreciated his recommendations for places to eat and drink nearby. 
70753,24748760,2015-01-02,21821899,Kyung Ju,It was a great hostel for me. But I was surprised that it was a mixed room that I lived in there with men and women. Also I had to use the restroom with men and women. I did not know that before arriving at this hostel. 
27056649,543899491,2019-10-08,196589597,Nina,The apartment was amazing. It was very clean and stylish. The bed was sooooo comfy. James is very helpful. The communication was perfect. I really recommend this location. Would definitely come back. Thanks for the nice stay James!
96383,1239351,2012-05-07,1929026,Jana,Staying with Jay was my first Airbnb experience and it was definitely a very pleasurable one! Jay is a very nice host and she was always helpful undertanding and caring. The room was very cozy and I felt home at once. It's quite and in a nice neighborhood (bus stations and a park nearby). I would absolutely recommend this room and will certainly stay here again when I come back to SF.
859336,121743481,2016-12-18,77864043,Xiaotian,很不错的入住体验房子离市中心不远也很方便房东不喜欢太晚回家对于年轻人这一点来说的话比较尴尬不过总体还不错
15215678,206467061,2017-10-25,56070276,Natalie,This place was perfect if you are looking for a quiet but great location to stay in San Francisco. When my husband and I pulled up we didn't really know what to expect because of some near by streets but it was perfect. The house itself was clean nice modern cozy and comfortable. Exactly what you need and more! They even had board games and items for children. It's was fabulous. The location was great too. Being as we are not from the area and know nothing about it; we were incredibly pleased. Short walk to bars shops and places to eat. The mornings are great to walk to a close by coffee shop and enjoy the beautiful weather. We would highly recommend this place and if we travel back would book it again!
748256,191496473,2017-09-07,67270688,Andy,Michael and Yesica's place was very beautiful and modern. The bathroom in particular super nice. The keys were easy to obtain with good instructions. The one thing was that we weren't sure if we had to wash our own bedding and towels so we left them as is.
1344752,50441159,2015-10-12,27161001,Brian,"The property is very clean neat and comfortable in a quiet neighborhood near public transportation. It's a good area for running as well. It's about a mile and half from Golden Gate Park through safe neighborhoods. Patti checked in a few times by text to make sure everything was going well. 

The only surprise were the baths. It's advertised as 2 baths but it is only 1-1/2 baths. It is stated in the body of property description that the 2nd bath has a commode and sink. I must have missed that when I booked. But we (3 couples) managed well and had a great stay in the city.   "
2970253,259811991,2018-05-02,18699038,Valérie,I stayed here 4 months as I have been completing clinical rotations here in SF. The apartment is in such an amazing location with easy parking wonderful views and great weather. Brett and Karen were always mindful to whatever needs I may have had at the time. A couple times I locked myself out of the apartment and they did everything they could to help me which I really appreciated. They have been beyond nice and welcoming and have provided me with a home away from home. The place has everything you need for cooking sleeping cleaning... I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing stay here in SF. Thanks again for everything Brett and Karen!!
8101297,128669764,2017-01-26,112326490,蓬,Christina is very beautiful and nice. The dog is very lovely.parking on the street is free for night but 2hour only during the day so we park our car to the garage for 22a day. The house is near by the sea and palace of fine art ~when we arrive the bed has a lovely bear .这是我第一次入住airbnb入住前挺忐忑没想到女主人超级漂亮身材火辣狗狗虽然很大只可是很可爱~早上会到房间里舔我老公的脚哈哈哈位置很安全我们玩到九点多都很棒而且走的那天才发现有一条街超级无敌多商店可以逛逛母婴的很多后悔发现晚了那么近!这中文的感觉真好写英文头疼死了(>^ω^<)
1510363,318901825,2018-09-04,89121665,Ingo,"We came in and felt like home. Modern clean a full equiped Kitchen and Bath. And a delicious smell of Tedd‘s self-made cookies. Fresh fruits on the table juice and joghurt in the fridge. 
And it’s well located. Two BART Stations (20 Minutes to Airport) and two MUNI Stations near by. And a few Bus Lines too (to the Beach Downtown Golden Gate Bridge ..). There is althought a Market and a 24h-Store closed by and a few good Chinese Restaurants.
Charlesie and Tedd are perfect hosts they had usefull tipps a beautiful garden ... And we had nice conversations.
Perfect 5 Stars"
1864390,20177356,2014-09-25,11364846,Linda,We really enjoyed the time in kaleen's apartment. The flat was like on the pictures and the welcoming was charming. Kaleen supported us with maps and ideas where to eat. The bed's are very comfortable :) we can absolutely recommend!
8739,196626738,2017-09-23,135950573,Richard,What a great place! A huge comfy room at the rear of a fine house overlooking a sunny garden plus an equally huge bathroom. Ivan and Wendy are welcoming and helpful and their coffee is great! Forget any trepidation you might have about staying in the Mission: their home is in a perfectly safe area and surrounded by hip shops restaurants and bars. Public transport via BART and bus is nearby and easy to work out. Would definitely stay here again.
17010389,565659056,2019-11-17,81954432,Amelia,This space was great for our weekend away! It was close to everything and although it was a room inside a house/apartment- it was and felt very private and had everything we needed! Thanks Carl Franc and co hosts :)
16535678,471048025,2019-06-16,30728152,Margaux,Catherine is an amazing host. The flat is so lovely so well decorated and in a great spot. I highly recommend this place! You will love it!
20154622,305094195,2018-08-10,13924218,Bojan,Nice house nice hosts and very good breakfast. Very plesent stay.
870532,48382639,2015-09-26,22353986,Fadi,The place is indeed charming. As described in the pictures it has natural light in the living room and the place is very well put together. We had abundant clean sheets and towels. Gary is a really nice gentleman who is very helpful (check his guidebook with useful tips and recommendations). Most importantly is the location: it is very central at the crossing of market and castro with all bars restaurants as well as public transport stations at two steps away. Space suitable for a small family or a group of 2-3 friends  would definitely stay there again absolutely recommended 
468751,161907807,2017-06-18,6757919,Iraide & Carlos,Lovely days in such a perfect house located in a super nice district. We felt like at home. Close to Everything you Need! I would hardly reccomend if you are also travelling with kids. Thanks!
19808052,194067326,2017-09-15,2037024,Wendy,"We absolutely loved our stay at Alison's place. Our stay was primarily for work and we needed a quiet safe and clean place to crash at the end of our long days. Alison's spot fit the bill perfectly.

She was very communicative with us during the booking process and made sure we have clear instructions on how to get into her home on our day of arrival.

Her place was incredibly comfortable. Our room (#4) included a super cozy king size bed and ample storage space for our clothes and luggage. We also enjoyed the lovely bay window overlooking the street. 

Sleep was not a problem -- street noise got super quiet into the night and made it nice to rest with the windows open.

The bathroom and kitchen are shared spaces - but we never had an issue with running into other guests. 

All in all -- a great stay and we can't wait to go back."
1480015,80515985,2016-06-18,68529240,Yves,Ben is great! Accomodating super responsive and relaxed! All descriptions of the apartment matched with reality very clean and lovely place.
795254,191248385,2017-09-06,29128595,Mike,We stayed at Jane's wonderful place from Sunday 3 September to Wednesday 6 September. Great place to relax after a busy day in SF. Don't miss out on Jane's amazing chocolate chip cookies!
6169292,85718941,2016-07-12,42157404,Carla,Room was clean and exactly as described. The convenience of the kitchen was nice and the free parking was a plus. Walking distance or if you don't want to walk up and down hills there is a bus stop right at the sidewalk. Would definitely recommend and stay again
6688004,126681366,2017-01-13,4447297,Freddy,Linda is a great host! Communication with her was good. The checkin/checkout process was smooth. Even though the house is older its quite nice and I really enjoyed my stay. I liked that I could get some privacy with my space if I wanted to by shutting the door. One thing to watch out for is that this listing is on a hill. It wasn't too big of an issue for me though and it is actually super close to Bernal Heights which is really awesome to walk up to. The listing is relatively close (short uber/lyft ride away) to some pretty cool restaurants and bars as well. Overall would recommend this place!
25229521,427443679,2019-03-23,172934395,Oscar,Very cozy place. Easy access to public transportation and 5 min away from the beach.
3319447,19370812,2014-09-11,12566125,Tara,Such a wonderful little spot! We couldn't have asked for a more perfect first experience using Airbnb. Perfect location for exploring the city - Anna is a wonderful host and provided us with so much helpful information. The apartment is clean very comfortable and perfect for a couple :) 
7972067,537491675,2019-09-28,50213458,Aj,Great location and beautiful space with a backyard and garage. We really enjoyed our stay and were able to easily walk to most of our destinations.
748256,24452039,2014-12-28,1279258,Helena,I had a short but sweet 1-night stay at Michael and Yesica's home. Their place is beautiful (a more modern building in the neighborhood) and located near great local cafés shops and restaurants in the Mission. They were perfect hosts providing details instructions prior to check in and totally respectful of privacy while still being friendly. 
10648093,111318982,2016-10-30,24384747,Michael,Colette's amazing historic place is a little slice of heaven!  It's the nicest place I've stayed in San Francisco for sure!!  Thank you!!
1478708,171428488,2017-07-17,11519340,Sven,The apartment is about 60min bus-ride from the city center. But anyway it is in a quiet area and it is near the besch (try Beach Chalet restaurant!)
734839,25690266,2015-01-23,25719448,James,My family and I went to SF for our family vacation. Kenji was not only polite and sincere but so very helpful. His space was clean and inviting at the same time and so organized. Everything you could think of was  included. No shortage of towels or other essentials that I read from reviews of other locations. I enjoyed the tea ceremony that Kenji used to welcome us. He also made sure we were familiar with all the amenities around his location. My wife also really loved the way he decorated as well. Could not ask for s better host or a more comfortable space to live while in SF. Thank you Kenji. We will definitely look you up again when we go back to SF.  Potential renters you can't go wrong with Kenji.   
545685,297377243,2018-07-27,86873378,Becca,Great place to stay!  Communication was frequent and prompt.  The space was comfortable and welcoming.  The location is in a quiet residential area with some restaurants and a Starbucks a couple of blocks away on a main street.  Easy bus trip or Lyft ride down to the main tourist areas.  Would absolutely stay again!
72365,194361979,2017-09-16,42563275,Jiune,A brief review of sailing terms and technique was awesome. And we experieced 300 degree turn over which was good. As a matter of sightseeing Beautiful and sort of private-oriented. If tired of excursions in groups so recommendable with reasonable price! 
6272183,52083455,2015-10-26,44298600,Jerry,The studio was great. Very clean well equipped and in a very nice area. We will definitely like to stay again on our next trip to visit our daughter. 
8048653,253213471,2018-04-13,175023419,Sudaish,The hosts were welcoming and gave very good suggestions of things to do whilst in the city. Parking the car was easy and it was very easy to get to the bnb. Since San Francisco is small was easy to get around as well. Very clean and a mordant place with good amenities. Enjoyed the stay. Would surely recommend staying here
13810224,237942432,2018-02-24,21412369,Junko,"Very nice and clean space in a nice neighborhood! It's very quiet and great for good night sleep:D Easy walking distance to Noe Valley restaurants & shopping area also great access to Muni lines. 

One night it was very cold and we couldn't figure out how to use the heater. I think it was holiday night but they came and took care of it right away. Very nice of them.

Would highly recommend staying at Lochlann's place!"
20195883,273613271,2018-06-06,34509547,Rodrigo,Joyce’s place is very nice clean quite and with a parking spot definitely a plus. I highly recommend.
2518781,32106285,2015-05-14,5450937,Anne-Sophie,"We had a great time at Scott's place. 
He was wonderful with us and cared about our well-being. This appartment is a good value. We recommand"
1687330,468577563,2019-06-12,234588683,Brenda,Very cute place!! Perfect location for out-of-towners looking to see the sights!!
937842,249099952,2018-04-01,159472065,Rob,"This place is simply amazing. Clean tidy and beautifully interesting and quirky. Very close to some great restaurants and cafes and within easy commute of downtown San Francisco. 

The hosts Amadis and Martha were incredibly helpful offering useful tips and insights into the local area. They are lovely people and communicate quickly and effectively. They were especially kind in offering to store some luggage for us after our flight out of San Francisco was cancelled at the last minute. 

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this place to all my friends and family."
10385321,403868656,2019-01-21,171514038,Dan,"Robert’s place is amazing.  Beautifully decorated and very comfortable (for family of 4 including my kids - ages 10 and 7).  Amenities came handy (dishes silverware coffee tea etc.).  The backyard is very inviting and included a trampoline that the kids enjoyed throughly.  The neighborhood looks a little run down but we never felt unsafe.  This place is perfect if you plan on doing lots of sight seeing (we did Alcatraz Golden Gate Bridge Presidio downtown SanFran etc.) but want a very affordable and cozy place to stay.
Robert himself is the perfect host.  He welcomed us to the place and was always available for any questions we had.  His suggestion of the Chinese place around the corner (we did take out) did not disappoint!  
Parking was tricky as other reviewers pointed out but it was never an issue.  We always found a parking spot either right in front of the place or the next street over.  Overall we were very happy with the experience!"
18314694,426668916,2019-03-21,93206244,Jiangshan,Great place to stay!!
15434462,509589177,2019-08-14,43679273,Zz,旧金山性价比极高的房子导航很容易找到带着父母一起住这个两室一厅正合适有厨房可以让爸妈做一些简单的中餐房东一家热情和蔼由于行李较多部分景点有些担心安全问题房东及时打消了我们的顾虑去了想去的地方拍了最美丽照片特别感谢!
643918,61295192,2016-02-02,43990493,Quentin,I had a great stay. Pete's apartment has an amazing view on Telegraph Hill Russian Hill and the Bay and is located within one of the nicest neighborhood of San Francisco with everything within walking distance.
9021715,57927620,2015-12-30,4900115,Jordan,"There are some good things about this place really a free standing house (see below) but unfortunately it was overshadowed by the huge and noisy construction site that wraps around it directly next one side and around the back.  Work started at 7am everyday.  This is not the owner's fault but unfortunately it means prospective guests should be aware of this and bring ear plugs. 
On the good side it is spacious was relatively easy to get to Pacific Heights and Divisadero warm and has a nice kitchen.  There is one picture that has a larger bed in the back room but it is only a single (plus the main bed and a fold out sofa in the living room).  "
11345707,547719643,2019-10-15,206703537,Titus,"Maybe my best airbnb experience so far. The cottage is nice and cosy and slightly bigger than what we expected from the pictures and descriptions. Totally enough for 2 (close) people even with some luggage.
Nice neighbourhood with a lot of restaurants and a good supermarket as well as bart station inwalking distance. Bart costs $2 to the center uber also affordable.
Michael is a great host lots of usefull tipps and support takes his time for for you even when he is in a hurry. You get the feeling that you are rather a welcome guest than a customer. 
Thanks a lot."
4617719,36396250,2015-06-28,6627569,Jill,Garland was an amazing host! He was very accommodating and even left delicious treats for my party to enjoy. For any travelers new to San Francisco I would definitely recommend staying here. 
21170799,497812430,2019-07-28,10496631,Julian,Apartamento muy bien situado para visitar la ciudad de San Francisco.  Hay transporte público alrededor.  La comunicación con el propietario ha sido excelente.  El estado del piso es excelente y las camas súper cómodas.  El piso tiene todo lo necesario para cocinar y servir.  Alrededor hay servicios de restauración que hace posible no tener que cocinar.  Muy recomendable
6600081,46564386,2015-09-11,175,Christian,I had a lovely stay with Del and her family. The room was exactly as described and I was overall extremely happy and satisfied with my experience. Highly recommended.
2592518,355586469,2018-12-04,149224163,Amy,Daniel's place is great.  It is sparkling clean quiet and conveniently located.  It was perfect for us.
10820,2743515,2012-10-29,2389282,Michelle,We loved staying at Bernat's place. It was perfect for our family. The garden roof deck was a treat. We would stay there again.
14948905,428319816,2019-03-24,242498889,Jon,My younger sister just had her first baby and lives in Lower Haight so we wanted a spacious place where my parents and siblings could comfortably stay in when my sister (new mother) and her husband and newborn needed some peace and quiet.  This place absolutely delivered and then some!  The hosts were gracious and very helpful with providing tips and added amenities (thanks for having beer/wine there ready for us!).  The place was pristine with lots of space and a beautiful zen garden on the back patio.  The location was awesome with great views of the city and excellent restaurants nearby.  Thank you so much for sharing your home with us!
4902907,51693255,2015-10-24,15626735,Yvonne,Welcome and instructions were perfectly arranged. Room clean and small but comfortable bed. Not mentioned is that toilet and shower (clean also) are to be shared with other guests. Neighboorhood has a lot of homeless people you should be ready for that. 
16706877,359348619,2018-12-16,23398765,Mary,Excellent location in the Lower Haight + very quiet and private. J was a great host.
10385321,262984841,2018-05-10,12006200,Steffen,Robert und seine Familie waren sehr angenehme Gastgeber. Die Wohnung ist mit zwei Zimmer geräumig und bietet zudem einen Außenbereich. Die Innenausstattung ist hochwertig und alles ist absolut sauber. Mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln lassen sich alle Attraktionen von San Francisco sehr gut erreichen. Wir bedanken uns für den tollen Aufenthalt in San Francisco.
598271,81843127,2016-06-25,12184571,Hyun,One of my favorite listings in SF so far! 1) Beautiful House : Fran's place is beautiful inside and out. Characteristic exterior and a private deck outside my bedroom were especially nice. 2) Nice Neighborhood : Potrero Hill is one of my favorite spots in SF with nice views. Fran's place is nicely located in this neighborhood close to Mission. 3) Welcoming Host : Fran was welcoming and easy to communicate with. She gave me clear instructions on how to get to the listing and how to use the listing. In conclusion I would love to come stay here again :)
256148,301163099,2018-08-03,19050635,Libby,The room was clean quiet and very comfortable. I felt very cozy and at home!
12981814,316182418,2018-08-30,149256273,Jake,The Inn at the Opera hotel was a very nice place to stay when in San Francisco. It is located right by the City Hall and Opera symphony which provided for great photo opportunities. The place was clean and spacious.
14126085,141356372,2017-04-02,120985087,Kate,My dad stayed at Jane's for 3 days while visiting SF and really enjoyed it. The neighborhood is very walkable and Jane has a great back yard. Jane was really on the ball in terms of communication with us--answering our questions right away and ensuring any worries were resolved before we thought of them.
1484792,24155145,2014-12-21,6991096,Susan,The apartment was great and so was Mario! I was there for work and it was a very comfortable situation. When I have to go back to SF I would definitely reach out to to stay here again.
13600947,185077724,2017-08-20,141180974,Michelle,Wonderful place to stay!  Would highly recommend.
148627,53057231,2015-11-04,14785185,Katherine,While Lombard St is very busy as a primary route to the Golden Gate Bridge and beyond this apartment is tucked away with its own private patio. It is a very convenient location with new kitchen and bath. There is limited living space since it consists of the kitchen entry area and the queen bedroom but it served our needs very well for our 4 day 5 night trip and was very convenient to where we wanted to be. Cafe Golo across the street has good breakfasts too. 
21790140,338145857,2018-10-18,206430714,Pierre-Mathieu,Very nice appartement nearby plenty of nice restaurants/bar. Very clean and comfortable.
23714398,331439572,2018-10-02,39846314,Edward,the discription and photos are spot on which are beautiful.  The place was very clean and has great artwork and is full of light and color.  Corner unit has great views and stain glass.
10981310,133120786,2017-02-20,112762297,Melissa,You won't regret staying with Maggie. The location is perfect. Her charming home and hospitality makes you feel warm and welcome. Her home is comfortable clean and inviting. We loved her recommendations and the flexibility to explore anywhere in the city from her doorstep. Thanks Maggie!
5070945,34101603,2015-06-04,32542418,Stephen,This was a great place to stay. It was very clean and had everything that we needed. There are communal bathrooms but they were very clean and I never had to wait for the toilet or shower. The location is great and my stay went very smoothly. I would definitely stay here again. 
57561,462107495,2019-06-01,57062019,Thanh,"If you are looking for a place you can call “home” in SF Theo’s apartment is the place to be! 

It’s such a catch in a very peaceful safe and lovely neighborhood. Super convenient to go everywhere it will take you only a short walk to the bus station and the Bart. It’s so close to Mission Street and you can easily find restaurants in just few minutes. I loved going to Precita Park every morning (5mins walking) having a cup of coffee with some delicious pastries in a coffee shop nearby. If you love hiking then Bernal Heights which is only 15mins walking from Theo’s apartment will give you the best of 360 degree view of SF.

The apartment is clean well decorated well furnished and lightened with sunshine! The patio is amazingly beautiful with a touch of Buddha statue and a fruitful lemon tree. It’s perfect to hang out and have your breakfast at the wooden table there. I guess you can also do a BBQ there but I didn’t try it. 

And Theo was very well responsive. The communication via message was clear and fast.  He would respect the guest’s privacy too much that I didn’t get the chance to meet him up in person to say thank you. But if you are lucky maybe you could meet him haha.

I’d strongly recommend this Airbnb an definitely love to come back again!"
21057963,531931869,2019-09-18,100964831,Dean,Mitch’s place was comfortable clean and convenient.  Loved the short walk down the hill for coffee and breakfast at Le Marais Bakery.
23584006,526316445,2019-09-08,118261718,Dennis,The apartment is great to be outside of San Francisco but not too far to get downtown easily. The location is very clean spacious and there are many amenities you will night. Conversation was perfect whatever you need you will receive an answer within minutes. Thank you for hosting us we really enjoyed our stay in Daly City! :)
15876545,297984078,2018-07-28,469189,Chris,Victor's place was very comfortable clean and well equipped. It is not close to any of the major tourist sites however Ubers are plentiful and relatively inexpensive (to the extent anything is in the Bay Area). We would love to return. 
379349,8328914,2013-10-26,8760337,Troy,"My first morning here I realized I had made a terrible choice in booking this place.  Unfortunately I was locked in because the money had been paid and collecting a refund would have been a battle and most certainly taken weeks.

Theses were my issues
I choose B&B's because I like the personal hospitality.  Miriam avoids any contact with her guess.  Leaving a written message explaining that most likely there will be no personal meeting.  Even when I made two attempts to call the number provided there was no answer nor ability to leave a message.

The written instructions request you to lock the door when leaving.  Sounds intuitive right... But the fact you have to use the code to lock and unlock the door is not explained as if every home in America has this type of key pad locking system.

The wifi service was so poor that it truly reminded me of dial up were you could wait up to 60 seconds for a simple (Hidden by Airbnb) search page to load.  I used my phone instead.

I was shocked when I went to get a drink of water there was no type of cup/glass/mug etc to drink from.  I found two paper disposable  cups in the bathroom.

There is a cleaning fee per day but never was any type of refresh service provided.  The same paper bathroom cups towels etc were there for 4 days.

I will say the space was clean the shower water was hot and the private entrance was nice.  Unfortunately it wasn't the right place for me."
14552166,148371407,2017-04-30,48199298,Brandon,Great little place. Nothing fancy but exactly what I needed for my 4 night stay. Was perfectly close to a lot of shops a good amount of food places and just a short walk to BART. Enjoyed it a lot. 
30688177,446937446,2019-05-02,38129670,Gabriela,What a gorgeous little cottage! Exactly what I needed for a solo work trip/vacation to SF. Not too far from the city; I could take a shared Lyft downtown for about $9. The bed was so comfortable I enjoyed the option to cozy up inside and watch Netflix and the bathroom was equipped with soothing essential oil shower products. I’ll be back 1000%!
516836,85641430,2016-07-12,286351,Mateo,Fran's home is amazing.  Top location great views great amenities and a super friendly host.  I would highly recommend this gem for anyone looking to stay in SF.

2510224,173116685,2017-07-22,2567133,Elizabeth,We enjoyed our time at Sahar's place. It's nicely located in San Francisco a short ride from downtown. There's an eclectic vibe about the apartment which added to the experience. She's a lovely and warm host. 
11713614,163148107,2017-06-23,134175553,Jared,Great place with a spectacular view! Everything was just as described so if you like what you read in the description go ahead and book!
6117147,327931252,2018-09-24,16622718,Nicole,Diane's place was wonderful. It offered easy independent entry and a great location for what we wanted to do/see in San Fran. It was clean cute and cozy with a private outdoor area for hanging out in your downtime. She left a book of restaurant suggestions and offered us advice on camping/beach locations. Overall I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or a cooler host.
5918090,519541984,2019-08-28,1591898,Matthew,The house was wonderful for our family great location and easy home base to explore from.  The backyard is stunning.

33969322,500219246,2019-08-01,140809410,Wesley,The hospitality here I felt was outstanding.  When we checked in we were greeted with a very friendly and smiling person. The rooms were nice and different. The only thing I did not like were the parking. Only valet parking. Although I didn’t care for that the valet guys were awesome and very helpful. Because of that I was over the parking issue. Thank you!
13606695,538458707,2019-09-29,294420893,Sanjana,I really enjoyed staying at Max's place. Everything was very clean and even better than I expected. I will definitely stay here again if I am in the area.
3759368,40595779,2015-08-01,34634042,Rosanne,"We had a lovely stay in Leo's studio apartment in the Castro area. It was clean homely and very comfortable for the three of us - my two adult daughters and I had a 5 night stay. The Castro area is great lots of good restaurants and shops convenient for public transport and safe. We loved the area and San Francisco generally - this was out first visit and we would happily return to this accommodation.
The apartment is as pictured and described and although we didnt use the garden it is nice to have! The only thing missing is a sink in the kitchenette area but as we only had breakfast in the apartment this wasnt a problem for us.
Thanks Leo and Dan - I hope we will be back some day!

7663003,150859518,2017-05-09,7157101,Jérémie,Le séjour s'est très bien passé. L'endroit est petit mais juste assez grand et calme. Il est facile de marcher jusqu'à n'importe où dans la ville à partir de là. Ma copine et moi recommandons cet endroit fortement.
7949668,515339237,2019-08-22,287395845,Matthew,Very clean and respectful. Great value.
8739,22866040,2014-11-16,2885113,Alexandra,My husband Justin had a wonderful time with Ivan and Wendy. Their apartment is beautiful and perfectly located the room is gorgeous and they are a very warm and friendly couple. He only had great things to say about his stay! Hopefully we both will make it back to San Francisco soon. 
21766603,319976868,2018-09-07,64070389,Castro,"The place was perfect for a couple and their dog. So many nice touches everywhere - the past reviews were not wrong regarding shampoos and soaps! We were won over right away when we walked in and found a personalized welcome sign on the coffee table a dog bed and dog bowls for our pup! When there was a little issue that was completely out of their hands - they had the problem resolved within minutes and we found a bottle of wine on our doorstep. They were the perfect hosts and they even let us check-in early which was a life-saver! I've been to San Francisco numerous times but never to the Outer Richmond District - I am so jealous of everyone who gets to live in that neighborhood all the time! It is a dream location. You can see the ocean from the bedroom and living area - I know they call it a ""peek-a-boo"" view of the ocean but that phrase does not do the view justice. The hosts gave us great reviews of places to visit and restaurants to eat. And the Sutra Baths are in walking distance! I just can't say enough about our stay here - we're still on a high from the week. Thank you for allowing us to stay at your place and for giving us such a memorable experience in San Francisco."
4833101,307151104,2018-08-13,12763131,Jordan,Mike is a great host with an amazing historic space in an awesome location. Mike was friendly and accommodating. He had great suggestions for things to do around SF and with his help finding street parking was a breeze. The area is really walkable - close to cool shops and places to eat. The best part of my experience was the house itself. Such a beautiful and unique place. Staying here was really a once in a lifetime experience. 
1620411,175375873,2017-07-28,3730992,Jerry,Could not ask for a better experience than the stay at Amitsa's place.  Clean  comfortable quiet and well-located.  This is the second stay for me and I will be back again...
32191720,555632700,2019-10-27,135666661,Danielle,"Our stay here was nothing less than perfect. The room was beautifully set-up the bed was comfortable and we had plenty of space to setup a port-a-crib for our 8 month old. Access to the kitchen living room and dining room made our stay outstanding. The kitchen was beautiful and we enjoyed spending time in the communal spaces. The breakfast goodies and snacks helped us thoroughly. And use of the refrigerator and sink was a life-saver especially when traveling with a baby. We were made to feel at home from the instant we walked in the door. 

As an added bonus the location of the house felt centrally located and we easily drove to our destinations around the city without a problem. And when we asked about stashing our luggage for a few hours past our check-out time Michelle graciously obliged. 6 out of 5 stars. We will definitely stay here again."

221342,145298760,2017-04-17,26779925,Steve,Bill's place is located in a great location. I was able to easily walk to many of my favorite places.  Public transit is also close. I rented the master bedroom which has an awesome deck with great views. The communication with Bill before and during my trip was great.

715754,4786616,2013-05-26,5669682,Ann,My boyfriend and I stayed in this flat from the 21st of May through the 25th. Greg and Deb were extremely nice and accommodating - we had no choice but to arrive very early on our check-in day and they were more than happy to store our luggage for the morning while we explored the city. Once we returned we were happy to see that the apartment was immaculately clean spacious and did indeed have a stunning view! We didn't even go out that first night but simply stayed in to make dinner and enjoy the space. Deb was easy to contact when we needed her and provided a ton of useful information in her welcome packet which made our entire trip easier. She also loaned us a tin of coffee for the week which was much appreciated along with various snacks and a bottle of red wine. Above and beyond hosting! This was a much better choice than staying in a hotel and I would highly recommend booking this space in particular. Great location in the city and it just made for a fantastic trip! 
63247,467715613,2019-06-10,28163167,Mallory,This place was perfect for our long weekend trip. It's not big but it had ever we needed. The location can't be beat...close to Mission and Valencia.

1985338,41783082,2015-08-09,31636855,Philippe,"Étape très agréable à San Francisco. Un peu excentrée (compter 40 mn pour Downtown en bus) mais située dans le ""village"" de Bernal Heights à l'ambiance très ""bobo"" et branchée. La chambre est bien équipée et très calme. Accueil sympathique et discret de Julien et Nichole. Adresse à retenir."

The corner the apartment is on is relatively quiet most of the time!"
15343159,112913876,2016-11-08,63236759,Lauren,Michelle was such a wonderful host. She wasn't just a host she was a friend. She made sure to make me feel welcomed in her cozy home. I stayed there for a little over 3 weeks and I felt like family! Her kids are a pleasure and each of us bonded well with each other. The whole house is a creative artistic bunch! Definitely was a perk. A lot of positivity flowing through this atmosphere. Michelle was very helpful and supportive as I transitioned my way from Florida into San Francisco. Oh and she might possibly have the best view of San Francisco. So add that to the list. :) 
21449226,419750193,2019-03-04,27915394,Chris,This is an amazing space! Perfectly located in the heart of Haight Ashbury. Tons of fun shops and great food nearby! The hosts were incredibly helpful and thoughtful.  We will definitely stay here again!
431632,154236969,2017-05-23,113316002,Virginia,Lindsay and Brian are very kind and accommodating hosts.  Their unit is in a wonderful location a 10 minute walk to the Golden Gate Park near great produce markets and close to major city bus lines.  The unit has everything you need for a trip to the city.  The kitchen has a toaster oven small fridge and single-unit burner great for breakfasts and slow mornings before heading out for a day on the town.  Lindsay and Brian were very available for questions and recommendations very friendly and welcoming people!

Thank you :)"
30513863,402209716,2019-01-17,6639784,Dakota,Jeff's place is clean convenient to downtown and easy to check into and out of. It's just short of a hotel which is nice - room service included. The only drawback is that it's pretty small. I wouldn't recommend staying with more than 1 maybe 2 adults for a few nights.
1107014,144874388,2017-04-16,513510,John,Excellent location with a beautiful view. Responsive host. Would definitely stay here again!
14990478,403427947,2019-01-20,6861385,Dan,Eddie and Chip's place is as described and great if you're looking to stay close enough to downtown but away from the noise and bustle. I was in town for a conference in downtown. The cottage was a 10 min walk to the Glen Park station (8-15 minute ride into the financial district/downtown) and I left my rental car in their neighborhood which had plenty of street parking. It's a lovely little space with a great garden and patio area. Chip and Eddie were even nice enough to allow us and a few friends to use their patio space for a night in with some wine and snacks.  The patio heater was perfect for the cold evening. Eddie and Chip also supplied plenty of snacks noodles plates utensils etc. which was much appreciated. All in all I'd recommend a stay at Chip and Eddie's cottage.
25952257,304542660,2018-08-09,4744341,Yarden,Highly recommend this space. Marc was a great host with lots of tips on the neighborhood. Loved the location!
11556239,74701295,2016-05-16,67277619,Neha,Harris was an amazing host. The room and facilities provided were as described and more as we also had a refrigerator in our room. Harris greeted us and explained every little detail and answered all our questions about the city. He said we could always talk to him if we had any queries. He also has maps and a book in the room which can be used as a guide to the neighborhood and the city. The coffee maker in the room was of great help too. The neighborhood always felt safe and quiet. The experience of staying here was exceptional and we will definitely recommend others to live here and will surely come back here while in San Francisco. It felt like a home away from home.
2274353,17059380,2014-08-06,16196312,Rachel,Amazing house! The two bedrooms are comfortable and clean. Chris is very friendly and had given us lots of travel information. 
216042,25546369,2015-01-19,1597455,Diana,"The fact that we've stayed at Green Dreams six times since 2012  speaks for itself!   We love this house and this neighborhood!  
My past reviews list all the reasons why.  Thank you Jocelyn for being so flexible about our dates and for all you do to make us feel so welcomed and comfortable.  We're already planning our next trip to SF and if your calendar is open we hope we can stay again."

Dylan and Alex left a book full of great tips and recommendations and the check in process was super easy. We loved the in ground bathtub and garden area. We would definitely stay again!
17424816,263319164,2018-05-11,34665681,Julia,Carl has thought about everything for his guests down to fresh robes coffee/tea and fresh fruit for breakfasts. The apartment was beauftifully styled yet warm and lived-in cozy. The location was perfect for accessing the pan handle and Golden Gate Park. I couldn't be more thankful for Carl's thoughtfulness and attention to detail. He was also flexible on our later arrival and check-out was a breeze.
15269286,198250403,2017-09-28,5198899,Milica,We enjoyed staying in Colin's loft during our stay in SF. While the place itself is newly renovated clean and has all of the amenities one would need we ultimately enjoyed its location the most. The loft is in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by Victorian homes it's close to the painted ladies and Divisadero St which is full of cute cafes bars and restaurants (with reasonable prices too). The hop on hop off tour bus stop was also nearby which we liked. Highly recommend staying here!
8351923,230708729,2018-01-28,166491182,Bella,So nice!

3122882,434390365,2019-04-07,31153876,Braden,Kara and Todd were wonderful hosts. The accommodations are super clean and exactly as described not to mention they go ABOVE AND BEYOND to ensure you have a fantastic time during your stay at their flat (fresh baked treats when you arrive great selection of coffee and teas personalized recommendations and extra toiletries if you forget anything to name a few extra touches). We will definitely keep them in mind for future visits to SF!
22671938,455594493,2019-05-19,52483582,Anthony,Great place great location. Tons of space for everybody so don’t hesitate to book it.
971069,21663069,2014-10-21,21128917,Joshua,Upon arrival I rang the bell at the front door and Jessica buzzed me. I walked up the stairs to her floor and found she had opened the front door for me in anticipation of me and my luggage. She was all smiles and made me feel comfortable immediately. 
6516295,67761628,2016-03-31,4060801,Aaron,This place was HUGE and amazing. Eriem was super responsive and easy to deal with. The place was clean and bright and he even had some bottles of water waiting a very nice touch.  I would highly recommend.  
575551,567540413,2019-11-22,33612831,Chris,I had the pleasure of staying at Serena’s home during a very busy week of travel in San Francisco. It was just close enough to the city where an Uber or Lyft was very convenient but far enough where I could avoid the crowds. Highly recommend for those visiting the city.
964751,83199787,2016-07-01,50083821,Ritu,"The place is exactly as described beautiful comfortable and convenient. Phil was very welcoming and available at all times needed. Its a beautiful studio (with all things included) facing a private garden. We were here for 3 nights and made the most of it the house has a great kitchen and I did indulge in some cooking (They have everything one would need for cooking). Loved how everything in the city was so close by with lots of food options available at all times. The only glitch if you are bringing your car along is parking. They have plenty street parking available however everything gets filled up very quickly and there are certain days of street cleaning during the days and you need to be vigilant and change parking spots as and when needed. It was convenient for us as during the day we were exploring the city. Thank you Phil for being so accommodative with our last minute requests and letting us stay in your beautiful studio. I am sure to recommend this studio to anyone visiting the city. 

P.S: If you are landing a little early in the city and need the studio available earlier than the time confirmed just contact Phil and check with him he is amazing and does his very best to accommodate.  "
2620371,239943079,2018-03-03,168358709,Poonam,It was a homely stay. Jay the host  was very cooperative and helpful all the time.

1110346,251344855,2018-04-07,14141269,Nicole,Stella is a zen rock star! Her home is a welcome retreat after roaming the city walking up and down hills and seeing fabulous views. The place was the perfect location for my work commute downtown. Just a 20-minute walk while watching the sun rise. I would love to return!
30042211,517724112,2019-08-25,171709409,Jenni,Charming guest suite to stay in while you’re in the city. Loved the complimentary snacks and the host even gifted us a bottle of wine as we had just gotten married. Cute safe location but still easy to access downtown and public transportation. We loved all of the recommendations as well!
10273567,162893064,2017-06-22,7139048,David,Catherine is a wonderful host with a super nice place. The room is just as described sunny and comfortable. She has a nice guidebook with local restaurants and her apartment is a 5-minute walk to Golden Gate Park and a 20-minute walk to great shopping and people watching on Haight St. I'd stay there again and would recommend it to my friends.
28674015,422224450,2019-03-10,37623439,Byrren,Very clean and tidy super easy check in and out. This was a great  location for quick access to Ocean beach for morning and late afternoon walks during my trip. Very prompt communication as well.
515524,146350426,2017-04-22,5961958,Erich,Great stay at Benita's apartment. Close to many things to see and do in San Francisco. Located in the colorful Haight Ashbury neighborhood.
20765941,334997093,2018-10-10,117232443,Colin,Great place with good transport links into the centre of San Francisco and off street parking. Would highly recommend!
4026354,194903513,2017-09-17,50527980,Emily,My family and I had such a great stay at Candy's. The location is great and there was plenty of space. Candy is a wonderful hostess.
8763620,62578305,2016-02-15,2003080,Su,"Duncan was a great host. He really cared about his guests and tried to make everyone feel welcome and invited his guests to a lot of communal acitivities. However the place was way to small for such a big number of guests (8 in total). Especially the bedrooms were so small that you couldn't even open your suitcase in there. Also the house was quite smelly (probably because of the dog) and messy. 
I'd only recommend it for backpackers who don't have high standards for accommodations and want to meet people."
7344289,103709750,2016-09-23,5533887,Vivian,We had a great time at the Garden Oasis. We were only there one night on our way to wine country but the apartment was clean and well equipped. We enjoyed walking through Golden Gate park to the Arizmendi bakery on the opposite side of the park--try the cheese roll! Thanks for a great stay!
53280,459045083,2019-05-26,27157685,Zoe,Excellent host and space would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!
1277771,260126995,2018-05-03,53168102,Paola,"Recomendada esta ubicada en un barrio tranquilo cerca del golden gate y golden gate park. Nosotros nos aventuramos a alquilar carro y la zona ofrece parqueos ordenados a la redonda y el barrio es muy tranquilo.

Llenó nuestras expectativas la pasamos bien y a gusto!"

25100083,401968619,2019-01-16,159027,Simone,Mary is a lovely host with a beautiful comfortable and well appointed space. It has unique touches and made me feel right at home. I truly loved my stay and the house.
442397,189390916,2017-09-01,62145850,Marianna,Очень хорошая квартира. Все как написано и как на фото. Хозяйка все подробно рассказала при заезде как чем пользоваться.  До центра (знаменитые пристани и Юнион сквер) далековато. Других недостатков не нашли.
17576074,502537661,2019-08-04,92548000,Dave,Bed was very comfy!
7547105,77342632,2016-05-31,68457355,Kreg,"I couldn't have picked a better place to stay for visiting San Francisco for my first time. I was welcomed graciously by Diana after I arrived from diner and the airport later in the evening. 

She showed me the private side entrance explained the house rules the use of keys wifi and the various switches for the lights (interior and exterior). 

One of the greatest hospitality highlights was the wonderful small plate of fresh fruit and cookies Diana had waiting in the room. Along with this she had provided multiple resources for things to do and places to visit while in the city. Her suggestion of the Dynamo Donut + Coffee place just a few blocks away was a great place to get a gluten free donut and some tasty coffee. A few tables outside allowed me time to eat drink and watch people enjoy the great weather! 

While I didn't take Diana up on her generous offer of borrowing her bike I appreciated the gesture. I was also grateful that she was available for any questions I had about the place or anything else I might need while visiting. Thanks so much for the great peaceful place to stay."
437385,177751269,2017-08-03,133140264,Julie,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Melanie's place. The room was very comfortable and the newly-renovated bath although small was of exceptional quality. There is a large closet and ample bureau space. The shower was great with loads of hot water. Melanie seems to have thought out everything her guests might need and all is well-organized and clean. The self-service coffee yogurt and her delicious homemade granola was much appreciated. We loved the location near Land's End and walking trails Golden Gate Park and museums. It was a bit further than we expected to other attractions in the city but this quiet neighborhood was much to our liking. We did not have a car but parking would have been very convenient. Although mostly residential there was a Walgreen's on the next block which was very convenient for supplies.
28920042,357602322,2018-12-10,27901870,Scot,Great place! Spotless and well-equipped and in a wonderfully quiet neighborhood. We loved our stay!

30069424,450216462,2019-05-08,254390763,Judy,Nice neat and clean. Comfortable beds. Only a couch in living area needs a comfortable chair or two for a house that has 3 bedrooms.
918341,355373793,2018-12-03,76817528,Carolyn,Kepa is a fantastic host and this space is private clean and in a great location. Can't wait to stay here again .
15911270,197748327,2017-09-26,27847249,Brittani,Lovely comfortable and private space. Kelly was so friendly easy to contact and hospitable. We loved her list of suggestions and exploring her neighborhood and city!
937842,12041475,2014-04-22,9210481,Nancy,Our stay in the Mission apartment was very pleasant. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. All the needed essentials for cooking were provided. The private outdoor deck off the kitchen was a bonus. Easy walking to Mission Street.
21812815,345341976,2018-11-04,68103037,Simone,Die Unterkunft ist sauber und gut mit dem Bus zu erreichen. Sehr nah zum Golden Gate Park und Strand. Ein super Ausgangspunkt um San Francisco zu erleben.
40138,9994458,2014-01-24,960706,Bita Miranda,This was my 3rd time staying at Ay's place.  It was just as wonderful as my prior experiences.  A peaceful environment in a good location with a great host.  There is always plenty of tasty treats in the kitchen too.  I had plenty of time alone as well as some great conversations with Ay.  An awesome spot to stay in SF!
9347891,75199519,2016-05-19,3413137,Gerd,Great city great apartment. We enjoy our stay very well. Everething was OK. Chris took care of everything. We can recommend it.

958507,514125155,2019-08-20,41481175,Kelly,BEST SNORKEL + EVER. Hector knows what he is doing and will encourage you to grow in skill. If your just wanting a fun but professional snorkel this is beyond anything a tour group can give. I have been on many group snorkel events and I learned so many basic skills that made the experience amazing. The technical ability made the exploration of the ocean so much better. You can see and touch so many things and feel safe. Honestly this is worth three times the value. I would have stayed for hours more learning diving about corals and every thing. This is the highlight of my trip!. Seriously I was blown away by this day. Don't hesitate!
19086077,249138637,2018-04-01,124875952,Linda,Great location very friendly host. Clean room and spacious living room.

15591362,120792293,2016-12-11,60638495,Corrie & Jeremy,"We stayed a week at Kris's place while we searched for our new home in the city and almost every day we were saying to one another ""I wish we could find a place near here!""  It's a lovely SF neighborhood a great apartment and Kris is a very friendly host."
17585947,348896818,2018-11-15,46640957,Chris,You can’t go wrong with this spot. the space is special the location quiet but close to restaurants close to land’s end trail and the museum.  easy check in. Comfortable stylish and welcoming. the kitchen is small but mighty! the bathroom tiling is remarkably beautiful. bed and linens like home. great place great value.
1931459,356585823,2018-12-08,2144747,Alex,We were fortunate enough to stay in Blair’s apartment for 5 months. It was absolutely perfect. The apartment is stylishly furnishes with everything we needed for a long term stay. We couldn’t have asked for anything more. Furthermore the location is perfect. You have easy access to the best part of the city (in my opinion). A quick walk to Fillmore street as well as Union Chestnut and Polk. We will would stay again in a heartbeat.
16427484,130632361,2017-02-06,61597604,Brian,The host canceled this reservation 32 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4896087,32999129,2015-05-24,10801122,Dayna, Cute and clean apartment. Small but has everything you need (TV iron microwave etc) and is an AMAZING location on a beautiful street. Was perfect for our stay.
1106534,19638120,2014-09-15,2212893,Riccardo,"If you're heading to the Bay - even on work - you really can't go past Rachel's cottage. 

Rachel herself is a lovely kind and considerate host. The cottage itself is so characterful that you'll wonder why she doesn't in it herself - in our conversations she explained that she in fact used to that it's family-designed and very much loved which adds to the appeal.

It's an extremely characterful place. Spacious and yet intimate. The bedrooms have wonderful lighting (skylights in the main) which are a joy to wake up to. The garden areas are lovely and being at the top of 27th you can of course just walk out look over and take in a stupendous view of an amazing city.  It's very much amidst what makes San Francisco so wonderful enough to make staying in a hotel seem a very silly option by comparison.

I used it as a pad whilst working in the Bay for 9 days; the amenities are wonderful (the beds get a particular mention!) and Rachel really has thought of everything you'd want for. Pack a toothbrush and you're set (or take a short walk to Walgreen's in Diamond Heights and that's solved). There's ample street parking too. 

Judging by past reviews my partner and I probably missed a bit of experience in spending additional time getting to know Rachel and her family better. We had a fairly packed schedule. Rachel did however stay in contact throughout asking how we were and if there were anything she should do to enhance our stay. Excellent service. And as others have written... the cat is lovely too.

We'll be back."

Definitely walk up by Fort. There is a great path leading over ocean towards bridge. 

Enjoy!!!"
4500244,186880310,2017-08-25,144405100,Angelika,Das Appartment war eingerichtet wie beschrieben allerdings mussten die Fenster offen bleiben weil es sonst einen leicht muffigen Geruch hatte. Das Appartment was sauber und mit allem ausgestattet. Die Lage ist fantastisch direkt am Dolores Park und Mission und gut an öffentliche Verkehrsmittel angebunden.
29515076,565704259,2019-11-17,12730846,Patricia,Mark deserves the super host designation This stylish place is clean and has extra amenities like a microwave refrigerator coffee maker with Peet's coffee and snacks. The bed is comfortable and cosy. Unfortunately there are homeless people all over the city including nearby and there is no close overnight parking.

2736358,29728055,2015-04-12,26440216,Catie,The apartment is exceptional with easy access wonderful linens/towels and well stocked for coffee/tea. There is a tiny fridge w/ milk juice and even a couple beers. Very clean and quiet. The pics and description on the add were exactly like what was posted. Sara made everything easy from getting the keys to allowing us to store our luggage a few hours after check out. Excellent location.

5547500,142521455,2017-04-08,81013571,Jacob,Fantastic weekend! This is a great place to stay and explore San Francisco. Jason and Ryan are wonderful people and I'm glad I had the opportunity to get to know them. It was the quintessence of Airbnb travel.
109883,26606755,2015-02-16,9838817,Patty,Adam and Joan were very personable and friendly. We also liked the size of the unit.  Peter is sensitive / allergic to musty environments and while this IS San Francisco we think the unit could use better management of the moisture.  They are using interesting moisture capture bags which we also will be buying for our own use :)  We had an interesting itinerary and Adam/Joan were VERY helpful and flexible which we appreciated tremendously!

60365,536983386,2019-09-27,69170881,Ken,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Emilie's place. It was exactly as described and and the pictures were accurate. Everything was spotlessly clean. The kitchen was fully equipped including spices. The beds were comfy and there were plenty of towels and soaps in the bathrooms. The back patio has a nice sitting area. The location is perfect and classic San Francisco. We were able to walk to markets restaurants bars and shops all within a few blocks. Emilie was so nice and responsive which made the whole experience that much better. Very impressed. We will definitely be back.
12410151,87158935,2016-07-18,15837729,Gabriela,"We enjoyed Paul's place! His home is decorated beautifully and it's clean. Our family of 5 booked this home based on location and the rooftop deck. The view is awesome!! We thought we would be spending a lot of family time on the deck but the weather was too chilly and windy. So the beautiful kitchen and dining area turned out to be our ""hang out area"". The living room area does not offer a lot of comfy seating but the kitchen was perfect for cooking or dining in sitting around talking sipping wine and playing cards. The sleeping arrangements worked out perfect. The futon was very comfortable as was the Murphy bed. There is plenty of bathroom space too. Since his home sits on top of bar/ restaurants and it's a very central location you do get a lot of street noise and music but we expected and it was doable. Because of the wind the front windows rattled and were drafty. We are all adults and enjoy the city very much so we didn't mind it too much. If you stay here you'll enjoy the easy access to the city lots of Gelato shops to choose from- or try a different one every day like we did restaurants a step away and of course a lovely home. Enjoy!"
11713614,448032975,2019-05-04,11156305,Darron,Fantastic apartment and location amazing views. Ann is a fantastic host with really useful information and local suggestions. Would highly recommend a stay at Ann’s.
2356554,421541066,2019-03-09,35226444,Janet,Well equipped apartment and a very comfy bed. Bernal Heights is a beautiful suburb with fantastic view of the city from the top of the  park.

25485559,276780649,2018-06-14,4744531,Tristan,Nice and quiet little place. Thai restaurant below is great. Were some other noisy guests that were a bit inconsiderate but otherwise a nice place. 
9119210,305077837,2018-08-10,177840365,Isabell,Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit in San Francisco. Es war alles da was man brauchte und die Küche stand vollkommen zur Verfügung! Das Bad war super und sehr sauber!

4957143,33841656,2015-06-01,33355789,Jenny,This was my first ever experience of airbnb and Beth and Tom set the bar super high! The apartment was beautifully furnished  spotlessly clean and full of thoughtful touches like guide books with unusual walking tours a yoga mat a well equipped  kitchen lots of towels and toiletries everything you could need.  But more importantly both Tom and Beth were so welcoming and very helpful with local information it felt like staying with old friends. The apartment is in a great location with lots of shops bars and restaurants  within walking distance. Just fabulous.

9118962,84015020,2016-07-05,73400011,Anne,The host was reachable but gave us the wrong code to the place and we had to wait 20 to 30 min outside in the cold trying to reach him and getting the correct code. neighborhood was quiet. We found parking nearby
3030653,26176809,2015-02-06,2694279,André,"Lindsay and Nicole were wonderful hosts! From ease of communication to the little touches like snacks and chocolates to welcome me my stay was perfect. 

The space was exactly as described and offered a nice quiet retreat. The location was also ideal with plenty of restaurants coffee shops and bars close at hand. I would definitely stay again!"
11181016,503307977,2019-08-05,22763693,Véronique,"We appreciated our stay in Jen’s house. It’s very clean (!) well equipped nice. We liked the district and the ambiance.
It will remain a good memory"
15343159,156503841,2017-05-30,7560304,Veronica,Michelle's place was a great experience for the quick weekender; the room was comfortable and spacious and Michelle and her family afforded us plenty of privacy but were still always available to offer assistance. Her kids were probably the most hospitable welcoming characters I've ever encountered upon an Airbnb check in. She also has two awesome cats who literally will become your best friends in about four seconds flat. The house was only a couple miles from a BART station which was walkable if necessary but transit by bus was equally simple. All in all a cost-effective welcoming and warm place to stay in San Francisco.
3290739,299833272,2018-07-31,60814301,Jacqueline,lovely classic san francisco room!
6107258,254142349,2018-04-15,55376262,Ondrej,"Location is amazing close to all San Francisco's ""attractions"".  You cannot get probably anything better for this price around. I would suggest to have no sweet option for breakfast. I would stay again next time."
47682,192071205,2017-09-09,27387227,Sara & Forrest,"this airbnb offering is located in a very safe and convenient location you can get anywhere in the city from here. the 1-california bus line is about a block away and whole foods grocery is also very near (3 blocks). polk street is just down the hill and offers many amenities. 
the airbnb is very spacious and could accommodate 4 people easily there are actually two bedrooms available.   the space is much quieter than i thought it would be given the location in the middle of the city. it is also very easy to 'self cater' in this airbnb and would be a good choice for anyone traveling for an extended period of time especially for business."
47682,106171044,2016-10-04,53587381,Lilla,Jay was a great host - super communicative and always available if I needed anything. I stayed with her for a number of weeks for work and it was a great home base. The neighborhood is very walkable and a great location to access all parts of the city.  
8438267,153077128,2017-05-19,29819771,Derrick,Had a great stay as usual! Very comfortable apartment.

7989636,120199375,2016-12-08,12036027,Libby,"So centrally located in Nob Hill close to the cable car line cafes and sights you can't go past Lindy's apartment for a stay in San Francisco! We felt very much at home and enjoyed our chats with Lindy who is very knowledgable about things to see and do so we saw some ""off the beaten track"" places as well as the main attractions. The snacks were very welcome and we found the bed comfortable and having our own bathroom a bonus at the end of a long day of exploring. We can highly recommend this as a super spot to base yourselves for a SF holiday!"
37748833,555537455,2019-10-27,259473093,Jasmin,Lovely home and very helpful host

Ashley was quick to respond to messages and the check-in/check-out process is organized and easy.

I would definitely stay here again."
9225,46362280,2015-09-09,41270797,Lorien,The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6378495,158638620,2017-06-07,109695275,Noel,I really enjoyed my stay in Chan's place. The location was perfect for me as I can't stand the tourist trap areas. Chan's place is ideal for access to public transport of any kind that can get you practically anywhere you need to go. Easy access to all kinds of pubs clubs and places to eat. Gave me an opportunity to meet other travellers and overall Chan was a great host to everyone staying there.
28550959,500817394,2019-08-02,11330461,Lauren,John and Renato were so kind and welcoming. It felt like they really wanted to help and told some great stories of their own travels. Communication was always brilliant with fast responses and accommodating to our needs and changes. Their house is beautiful with lots of beautiful plants and art. House is close to Haight Ashbury and easy to access the city and other districts as well as being very close to golden gate park. They gave us great recommendation for a local bar called Zam Zam where we got chatting to lots of locals as well as lots of information about transport etc. We were made feel very welcome. They very much allowed us to feel at home and provided lots of lovely additional touches.
4882295,256488670,2018-04-22,107898801,Daniel,Michael and Vernon were both extremely kind and great hosts. They are friendly and attentive and have great taste in TV shows :) The room is great and while the house isn't extremely central it's very easy to get to the Castro or downtown.
18904,67905713,2016-04-01,12341540,Jasper,Patrick was a great host during our stay at SF. The interior of his house was great and an absolute beauty to take in and also had subtle features which were great (I refer to the multi power adapter placed in a simple box in our room! Really needed it). The location allowed my wife and I to travel around the city with ease and affordability. Overall thank you Patrick for a lovely stay!
19039703,427072179,2019-03-22,6614238,Sebastien,Great place near the Golden Gate Park and with a Safeway just right in front. Spacious bedrooms. Very good!
778520,73698085,2016-05-09,13149114,Charlotte,This was my first time in San Francisco and it was wonderful! My stay in Sophie-Charlotte's apt really contributed to the great experience. Her house is beautiful I felt very welcome and had a very comfortable stay. Plus the location right in the hart of the Mission neighourhood was amazing what a brilliant vibe! I would definitely recommend this apt to others. 
1277771,139488695,2017-03-25,55821157,Penny,"Christine and her family communicated with us about check-in and out early on making it very convenient. The airbnb was very well equipped with shampoo conditioner shower gel 3 hair dryers coffee tea and pillows. It was very kind of them and made the place very comfortable.
There were also a lot of resources about what to do and entertainment there but we did not explore those. Make sure to check out their guidebook here on airbnb! They have good taste.
The location itself is great. I love the morning runs to either the beach or the park. If I can I would try to stay with Christine again the next time I am in San Francisco. "
25459169,293631075,2018-07-20,128918268,Heidi,This is a clean comfortable place to stay. It completely met our need for the night.
7309852,346749265,2018-11-09,542312,Evan,Maria's apartment in SF was absolutely fantastic for my colleague and me. It's location next to the park is amazing and was quite nice. Highly recommended!
225933,291919444,2018-07-16,194542313,Stephanie,We adored the apartment. Marcia was very hospitable and shared endless tips to make our visit the best it could be. The apartment is convenient to all areas of San Francisco.

2396847,31012841,2015-04-30,29872596,Michael,What more can be said of the studio than what has already been stated in previous reviews.  Clean  roomy  convenient and great hosts.  Perfect for business travel.  Highly highly recommend.
10273567,310573091,2018-08-19,6932973,Eileen,Catherine’s place was exactly as presented… Clean beautiful conveniently located and easily accessible. Catherine herself was a generous host and responded to my queries quickly and warmly. I would suggest  that anyone coming here would have a good experience with Catherine!
7844031,120478920,2016-12-10,79293045,John,Barry is the perfect host - he greeted me when I arrived gave me amazing tips about the neighborhood and was available whenever I had a question. His space is perfect for any kind of trip - it's set back from the street and extremely quiet but perfectly wedged between several amazing neighborhoods and public transportation. The apartment is huge well decorated and extremely welcoming. I definitely plan to stay here again and recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco. 
13021568,511729960,2019-08-17,249724266,Sarah,The room was very clean quiet and nice. Received the wrong set of keys for our room so we got locked out accidentally but it was a nice place. They were very polite.
4987668,304025892,2018-08-08,9551203,Austen,Mark is a very thoughtful host and his apartment is a great place to stay. He was always around to give assistance offer food or have a chat. The location was super convenient for me to get to work and it's close to some of SF's best cafes bars and restaurants. Everything about the apartment was super clean and well organized. I'd be happy to stay here again next time I'm in town!
1633173,454216044,2019-05-17,79134692,Rich,Herberts place was not clean when I arrived. The bed had dirty linens and there was dust and hair in the room and bathroom. There was a musty smell as well. It was unclear why a cleaning fee was added to the bill as the place was not clean. It was noisy up until 1:30 am with the occupants upstairs. The WiFi was not running and the heater did not work as it required a three prong outlet and the space just has 2 prong outlets.
4909117,142335691,2017-04-07,23074881,Tullio,Excellent value in the heart of everything. It's city accommodations so be prepared for some city noise; otherwise all good for the money. 
20837529,335283054,2018-10-11,101297969,Mauricio,Great host! My parents were extremely satisfied during their stay in SF; their first time using AirBnB!
17408793,406458087,2019-01-29,115699206,Jessica,The house was lovely. Very clean and modern. It was also close to many attractions. The host was very accommodating and quick to respond.
6643496,175773791,2017-07-29,21153795,Heidi,Don's home is clean comfortable quiet and safe.  He is meticulous about leaving clear notes and spoiling his guests with high quality surroundings and amenities.  He was welcoming when we arrived and accessible throughout but didn't hover.  He left us alone to enjoy the home as if it was ours.  There was always a parking spot for us directly in front of the house.  The view from this neighborhood is incredible!  It's a short hike to the Twin Peaks.  It was easy to get around the city.  I especially appreciated all of the little extras in his home such as wonderfully soft thick cotton sheets and cozy blankets the heated toilet seat the Nest products in the shower the snacks and beverages he left for us and so many more little surprises.  Warning for out-of-towners:  while the house was always comfortable the weather outside (throughout San Francisco and Oakland) can be quite cold even in the middle of the summer.  I wore jeans and fleece everyday and carried a lightweight coat for evenings.

3870174,47241457,2015-09-17,29641526,Nancy,Jack and Jason greeted us on our arrival in a most friendly way and made us feel welcome. Our room/facilities were comfortable chic and clean. Our every need was met and they were available to answer questions about the neighborhood. I recommend it highly!

3271517,37963262,2015-07-12,4476562,Magdalena,Truly excellent experience all around staying with Cort. He us an impeccable host with spot on communication  both friendly and unobtrusive.  His home is so lovely what a divine bed and bathroom !! His home is on a small block in the midst of some of the best that San Francisco has to offer. Fantastic food art and entertainment right around the corner or a short bus ride away. I recommend Cort and his gorgeous home most highly  but only on the nights that I can't book it myself!!!
14948905,224291768,2018-01-02,67607218,Jacob Birkeland Meyer,A big nice house with LOTS of space bathrooms and supercomfy beds. And the view and garden was wonderful as well. We loved it. A very  nice neighborhood and attentive hosts! Thank you

ดีใจที่เลือกพักบ้านของ Giancarlo ทำเลที่พักอยู่ใกล้ใจกลางเมือง ร้านอาหาร และร้านกาแฟ เดินเที่ยวได้สะดวก ปลอดภัย และอยู่ใกล้กับป้ายรถเมล์ และรถสาธารณะ

Thanks Charles :)"
21327347,273039083,2018-06-04,40271842,Nancy,We had a wonderful stay at Anna and Mike's lovely place. They were gracious hosts checking in with us to see if all was alright. Finding a nice bottle of wine some candy fruit and more was an added delight.  The apt. was very clean modern nicely decorated and quiet. All communication was very prompt. We highly recommend this spot and hope to return when we get back to San Francisco.
4430996,278351733,2018-06-17,44834234,Kati,We had an amazing weekend at the Green Tortoise Hostel. We stayed in a private room that had an incredible view of the city. They offer awesome events every night including free dinner! We loved getting to know the other guests and had a blast seeing a part of the city that we might never have explored. It's easy walking distance to Pier 39 Fisherman's Wharf the Exploratorium and more. We will definitely be booking directly with them next time we're in San Francisco!
21623314,451414047,2019-05-11,6906115,Christopher,Great location perfect host spacious & clean room! My definite choice next time I’m in SF!

No hay mucha variedad de comida cercana sin embargo la zona es muy tranquila y segura al menos nosotros no tuvimos problemas. 
El internet compartido es de calidad media relativamente lento."
10089183,450225288,2019-05-08,6128537,Gautam,This is a well located neat studio that was a great base for me. I particularly appreciate Robin and Jeff’s flexibility with my travel schedule including early check-in and holding my bags for a few hours in their home. Their consideration and hospitality was much appreciated and I would absolutely stay again.
13149975,141757219,2017-04-04,122142261,Andy,"Placed in a wonderful part of San Francisco this apartment is the perfect place to stay for all activities. Drew is a wonderful host who offered local favorites and a warm hospitality. 

The apartment was very clean and was larger than I had anticipated. Everything was fully functional which is very useful. 

This was my first time using Airbnb and with experience I had at Drew's place I don't see ever using hotels again. "
7067087,80122586,2016-06-16,55881236,Fiona,it's a warm and friendly atmosphere there's always something happening and you'll never be bored.
488297,88124132,2016-07-23,31305556,Dwayne,My collegues and I stayed here for a sale meeting we were in town for and I love this neighborhood. We work down near Powell and Market for which the Uber ride was only $13 on average. Very convenient for running around the city and the view is amazing. Would recommend this place to anyone and will look to stay here again.
1076743,154695383,2017-05-25,4212951,Zazie,Lovely stay. Clean comfortable with every modern convenience. 
2657854,23365334,2014-11-30,14394620,Kerry,Tom's place is great. The location is fantastic. Perfect for exploring the city. Mid way between the city centre and Fisher Mans Wharf. It's right on the Filbert Steps which is a local landmark in itself and very beautiful. The crowning glory is the roof top patio which offers a stunning view over the Bay. 
17434665,426350641,2019-03-20,34236735,Analisa,My husband pup and I stayed at Steve’s place for a month while I worked downtown at the Golden Gate Theatre. Immediately we walked in and were blown away. The pictures do not do it justice. It’s so spacious filled with light and brand new. There are huge windows with Mountain Views in the distance. The bathroom and closet are giant. I actually recorded some podcast episodes in the closet. :) The MUNI train is an 8 min walk down the hill and 4 stops to downtown. In the other directions are tons of shops and restaurants in West Portal.
16230722,154094170,2017-05-22,23712819,Ambar,Steve was very communicative and we had everything we needed for our one night stay. Daly City is always cold even if San Francisco happens to be warmer and sunny so be prepared. We were about a 10 min drive from the city. Place was clean and private. 
1352111,152829652,2017-05-18,119917606,Gloria,"Jenny and Norbert were great hosts very responsive and helpful. The house was modern clean and very well taken care of. Will definitely recommend and hopefully stay there again during future trips to SF.

25662,250954634,2018-04-06,68906427,Jeanne,Lovely stay. Quiet yet easily accessible to everything.  Loved the neighborhood
992676,492816135,2019-07-21,128175861,Ryan,A lot of amenities the garden looks nice! Fast responses and great hospitality!
3664261,106041453,2016-10-03,1564599,Joshua,Great place. Would definitely stay again
3664261,338181729,2018-10-18,63952057,Abigail,We enjoyed our stay at Max's place it felt homely and had everything we needed plus some super cute furniture and a great noise like when you power up in Super Mario when you turn on the tv.
465723,258215852,2018-04-28,165705870,Karen,Shelia greeted us and gave us numerous tips on how to going about exploring San Francisco. She was more than willing to answer additional questions. The place was spacious. Has a large closet and drawers to keep your items. Has your basic amenities (stove fridge and microwave). Neighborhood is quiet and friendly. Shelia allowed us to park our car on her driveway which was very convenient with such limited parking in SF. There’s a shopping center which is about a 5 minute drive and restaurants within a 10 minute walk if you want a quick bite.
806199,130968102,2017-02-09,24231401,Simon,"A fantastic property offered by a real super host.

This is a very clean cosy studio in central SF.  The space is very light and airy.  For me the location was ideal - a few blocks walk to my office and 15/20 mins to Market street and Westfield shopping etc.

Chantal was outstanding at communication before and during my stay.  I will definitely look to stay here again."
10859050,140255138,2017-03-28,115824671,Siddrah,It was so clean and the place was beautiful. Got to see a beautiful view of the ocean as well. A much needed place to come back and rest after miles and miles of walking! 
1815551,26616121,2015-02-16,8147499,Nicole,Sarah's place in Noe Valley is worth staying at for just for the views especially if you get clear skies while there!! Also do take the J-Church line to get to Market it is a very scenic ride. She had us set up well with wine and water to welcome us and the place itself is beautiful and clean just as in the photographs. I stayed there with my mom and we had a very comfortable time. Unless you have knee problems I highly recommend spending the extra energy and exercise staying at a place like this because you will be rewarded once you get to her place on the hill! Also the walk to the charming Noe Valley heart (24th Street) is a gentle slope and if you have never been to that area of San Francisco it is a great chance to experience a very charming neighbourhood in the city with the locals rather than stay in the touristy areas. Sarah is lovely and sweet and extremely helpful and responsive. If you get a chance to meet her do say hi she will make you feel very welcome if you are new to the city. All in all a very good experience with postcard views every morning a wonderful host and cosy clean place in a great safe neighbourhood! Thank you Sarah!
31964427,435553285,2019-04-10,4725988,Spring,Camille's home is beautiful stylish clean and in a quiet neighborhood.  We found it easy to access from all parts of the city.  Camille's instructions were quick and accurate.  We really enjoyed our stay and recommend this place to families single travelers or couples.
2175930,545657767,2019-10-12,288527774,JoNelle,A lot of thought went into this place. It’s adorable & clean! Aprox. 20 minute Uber to downtown.  Loved the private entrance from the side of the street. Comfortable bed/ pillows. Quiet neighborhood. Great place to stay!
21276107,558180495,2019-11-02,10515985,Michael,Ben & Topher were great hosts. Super friendly and nice. Baked the most amazing chocolate brownie. House was clean neat and comfortable to stay in. Thanks guys!
3442439,465371457,2019-06-07,6487794,Monique,Stylish clean and comfortable guest suite in Bernal Heights area of SF. Great location - close to the mission and the top of Bernal Heights Park. Fabulous shower.  Coffee provided was a nice touch. Just bring some earplugs as the sound travels from the main house to the rental space so you can hear footsteps dog barks goings on of daily life etc. Overall would recommend.
3759246,419305733,2019-03-03,131105104,Marianne,Very affordable SUPER comfortable bed and within walking distance of many tourist attractions restaurants and bars! Shower is a bit tight but we were able to make it work. We had no problems at this Airbnb and loved the old San Francisco feel to it! Location can’t be beat and David was very communicative and even got us Kleenex when my allergies were acting up. Thanks for a great stay!! Jeff the corgi is def a huge plus too! :)
10886231,280636025,2018-06-23,99640587,Pratika,We absolutely loved staying at Joy’s.  Both her and Lawrence were great hosts and are a great example of what Airbnb is about. They went above and beyond to help us we hope to stay with them again! 
6301675,250597162,2018-04-05,159518205,Ignacio,Had a great time there. The apartment is really nice and they kept it always clean. It's also close to everything I needed; Bart grocery stores Union square etc.
4184406,34729530,2015-06-11,15320418,Stephanie,Perfect location perfect host. Brian's home is comfortable clean quiet and spacious. But it was probably the little conveniences that makes this such a great Airbnb experience. Communal beer coffee tea almond milk snacks. A drawer in the bathroom with all those little toiletries you may not have packed or forgotten. A hairdryer (bless you). A laundry room with the biggest bad ass washing machine and dryer I've ever seen! There's also plenty of space in the closets of the guest rooms if like me you want to unpack a little. There's a little balcony and a secret garden so even when there are other guests there's always a private space to unwind. It's great to stay with a host who clearly loves and appreciates being part of the Airbnb community. If I ever return to SF I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Thanks Brian x
12562572,77163392,2016-05-30,65619057,Sylvia,Brad and Ray were both very welcoming and the apartment was clean and well stocked with everything that you would need.  Everything looked new and  it is a nice apartment  perfect for two people. We were there for a wedding and it was close to everywhere we needed to go. My husband and I were so glad we chose their place over a hotel and highly recommend staying here. This was our first stay at an airbnb and we were very pleased! Thank you Brad and Ray for a wonderful stay!
57479,13291574,2014-05-24,8245681,Alexandra,Beautiful apartment! Clean and very well kept. Great style and taste for furniture and decoration. The house felt like home immediately the deck was a great touch and much larger than it looks in the photos. Kitchen is well stocked all appliances are new and clean. 2 bathrooms were a plus and you can't beat the location. Late night food great bars and Bi-Rite across the street is great for picking up delicious snacks and ice cream. 
16331804,307137299,2018-08-13,185097155,Steve,Kevin's place was perfect housing for 4 people attending Outside Lands all weekend. We had a great time staying there and was impressed by the local tips the wifi and the sleeping options. Appreciated the quick responses thnaks again!

21252479,262115598,2018-05-07,47806878,Natalia,"Really nice place Kirill knows a lot about the city so you can ask him. Close to the Golden Gate park and the bridge. 
Highly recommended"
3759246,147420975,2017-04-26,41964524,Adam,"David's place was comfortable clean quiet and conveniently located. It's not right downtown but it's close enough with ample transportation options. 

The parking spot was a really awesome bonus. We only needed it for a night when we rented a car for some day trips but it was such a help to be able to park a car without thinking of other solutions. 

David is really good at communicating quickly and effectively. He is very responsive. 

I would definitely recommend staying at David's. 

Thanks David!"
1043282,411503920,2019-02-12,204819600,Erendira,John’s space is very clean and had everything we could possibly need and more.
6688004,51442900,2015-10-20,7381348,Brooke,Thanks very much to Linda for the wonderful experience staying at her house! She provided detailed information for the room/kitchen/etc. and was lovely to talk with in the mornings before heading out for the day. The garden/patio was a relaxing way to start each morning while having a cup of coffee and light breakfast. Her neighborhood has amazing views and our overall stay here was private friendly and very accommodating. Thanks again!!
7341076,340402945,2018-10-23,43977824,Lauren,Annria was so welcoming and accommodating allowing me to check in early and offered to let me stay later if needed. The room was cozy and sparkling clean as was the bathroom. She was happy to give me tips on what to do and had coffee available all day (!!). Anywhere I went in the city was 30 mins away or often even less. Overall would highly recommend! Glad that I ended up at her place for my 2 days in SF.
13751537,453789173,2019-05-16,7153207,Sam,Debbie's place was great! Awesome location very clean. Would stay there again.

929468,432399498,2019-04-03,20415986,Kazumi,"John's place is fabulous. Fashionably decorated interior with all the amenities. Very comfortable. It's conveniently located i.e. close to restaurants shops public transportation etc. yet it's very quiet.

John was very quick to respond to emails so that all my questions and requests were immediately dealt with. He was super nice.

I know how expensive San Francisco prices are. Among that John's place is a steal if you are lucky enough to get a reservation."
3030653,53168961,2015-11-06,5582157,George And Michelle,Lindsay and Nicole are fantastic hosts. They both exceeded expectations and went out of the way to offer us a heater or where to go in SF without my husband or I asking for anything. Their place is Mission was perfect for us - great neighbourhood with fantastic restaurants. We would come back for sure! Thanks for everything!
21217809,514218242,2019-08-20,11411764,Julia,Blu et Kim sont sympas. Maison charmante avec patio fleuri adorable. Grande chambre belle et agréable. Manque d'isolation et maison qui résonne donc pas pour gros dormeurs. Près du quartier Mission (vivant et coloré) et de plusieurs lignes de bus attendez vous tout de même à marcher en général à San Francisco.
516836,544699467,2019-10-10,13749295,Jo,Clean room with a nice view!
516836,150666869,2017-05-08,13665108,Ellen,Fran's home is  clean and comfortable with great views and access to the city. I loved that the books on the bookshelf are by many of my favorite authors. Fran has great taste in art and furnishings. I will be back if schedules allow.
4882295,87115053,2016-07-18,70463570,Fleur,Really Nice place to Discover San Francisco! The house was clean easy to drive to San Francisco or to take the bus! Communication with Micaeal was good!
17812931,404607058,2019-01-24,58999442,Irina,"Marie ist ein fantastischer Host! Wir wurden sehr herzlich empfangen und fühlten uns sehr wohl. Die Anbindung mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln ist sehr gut. Wir wurden mit einem wirklich riesigen Frühstück welches keine Wünsche offen lies bewirtet. 
Alles in allem können wir Marie nur empfehlen und würden sofort wieder bei ihr buchen!"
6145605,463715094,2019-06-03,22216974,Kwang,A nice and quiet place to stay but the room is a little small.
10321776,412517601,2019-02-15,114339999,Maya,Arpita’s place was sparkling clean. We had so much fun staying right across the street from the ocean.
4075971,21426580,2014-10-17,21227289,Chris,We were in town for a conference and Bobbie's flat was perfect for us. Clean quiet and close to the BART allowing us to easily get where we needed to be.
201579,49310816,2015-10-03,33534798,Amy,Eric's place was perfect. It was so much fun staying in such a historic area of San Francisco. The description of his place is very accurate. Very clean and a beautiful private deck in the back to enjoy a cocktail or cup of morning coffee. The neighborhood coffe shops and the restaurants were really unique delicious and fun. We will absolutely stay here again when we return. 
7939511,562351457,2019-11-10,1486277,Dylan,Very nice room with attached bathroom. Quiet and dark at night to really help you sleep well. The room is part of the apartment but is right by the entrance so you don't need to walk through the house and the room feels very private.
4902907,27377561,2015-03-02,4455093,Matt,Tony was a great host and the room was quite nice. Awesome location!
1351783,7880245,2013-10-07,8541498,Gabriel,Allen was very welcoming and the house was great! It was a perfect location near Golden Gate Park. We felt very comfortable there.
7220035,487164070,2019-07-13,13964354,Lisa Clark,Great spot!
6936417,241584714,2018-03-09,94837430,Heather,Olga was an amazing Host who was not only helpful but accommodating. She thought of every detail. Would stay here again in a heartbeat :)
21397854,228237783,2018-01-18,22343966,Daniel,"We really enjoyed our time in this place and wish we could stay for the long term! The interior design of the apartment was beautiful and it felt like from the minute we walked into it.
The location is the best in the city and the street is pretty quiet.
The apartment is at the right size for a couple - not too big and not too small.
There was only one issue with radiator heater which didn’t work from day one but the guy from the property management company was responsive and got us a temporary heater. It worked but it wasn’t as good as having a radiator working 24/7. It took a lot of time for it for actually to be fixed and they could fix it only by the time we were checking out. That was the only downside.
Other than that we had a really good time in the apartment! Highly recommended"
10058134,563418216,2019-11-12,2070728,Marsha,A bright comfortable  spacious and chic space.  Please walk to B Patisserie. Really to be entirely honest the best part of this apartment is Nakita the uber sweet kitty!
6415052,446986990,2019-05-02,57703581,Lisa,Highly recommend to stay at Chris’s place for a great location warmth light and a real feeling of being home ‘away’. Full five stars.
3793678,44684441,2015-08-28,1933212,Jeremy,My parents had a fabulous time at Trisha & Adam's 1BR apartment.  The place is ultra modern exactly like on the pictures with a very spacious walk-in shower. The location's unbeatable too: it's located close to downtown the ocean bus stops & Golden Gate Park. Big plus: Trisha and Adam were super responsive before and during the stay. Overall 5-star experience!
10787034,189774219,2017-09-02,4378613,Stefano,Very nice place quite close to BART railway system. The apartment was very clean. I highly recommend it.
16426353,447462403,2019-05-03,163320500,NikkiandRyne,Cheap well located place
424846,46618644,2015-09-12,23508278,Rein,We had a great stay at Martha's place. The neighbourhood is very quiet and has a lot of nice places and restaurants for breakfast and dinner. Bus to city only 2 min walk.. The room and bathroom was very clean!! Thanks
9150693,98552679,2016-08-31,46899954,Jenny,"The room was very clean and upon weighing the pros and cons cons definitely won. I had such a horrible stay here for several reasons.. 
1. My husband got harassed by thugs outside of this hostel-like airbnb. Felt very uncomfortable and unsafe after that.. 
2. You could hear people yelling and fighting outside from the room (No AC so you have to open your window) 
3. Right in front of a strip club and surrounded by strip clubs & adult stores.
4. Drugs everywhere especially at night.
5. Room was too small 
"
3720392,222424433,2017-12-29,405080,Hsieh,The orange suite is a comfy lovely space for two. The neighborhood is safe and quiet close to bus stop and many cafes/restaurants. Really enjoy the stay :) thank you Kelly!
9110032,329773487,2018-09-29,53592977,Luca,We had a very nice stay at Brian’s! Everything was just perfect for a stay in San Francisco directly located at the beautiful ocean beach. Brian’s mom was very friendly and gave us tips. I would recommend this apartment to everyone!
15776727,182520189,2017-08-14,20728851,Drew,We had a wonderful time staying at Kai's place. Easily one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. The location is blocks from all of the Mission's fabulous restaurants bars and boutiques. And the apartment itself had everything you could ask for ... and more. We hope to be back again soon!
4902729,110646402,2016-10-27,28061081,Tyson,clean convenient exactly as described. Tony was extremely helpful and prompt in all comms. great to be able to drop of baggage and use codes for access.  thanks for the stay.
7998215,130830934,2017-02-08,34721931,Leigh,We absolutely loved staying at Stephanie & Tom's place! The place is super clean and comfy and Stephanie and Tom are amazing hosts they gave us great tips on food and coffee and helped us with our many questions. The place has modern furnishings and had a great style well equipped and extremely safe. Superb location in the Mission district the best Mexican food we've ever had and the rest of the city is a short uber away. Would love to stay here again and would highly recommend this place to anyone! 
567239,205002773,2017-10-20,126812734,Cecile,Nous avons passé un excellent séjour  Judy et Ed sont formidables et ils nous ont très bien accueilli dans leur maison . Ils nous ont aider à préparer nos visites  et nous ont donner de bon conseils sur la ville de San Francisco . Le lit était très confortable ce qui était plaisant après une journée de marche dans San Francisco . Je recommande ce logement .
870705,17742445,2014-08-17,14258105,Francesca,We stayed in Daniel's apartment for a week while we attended a conference in downtown San Francisco. The apartment is in a brilliant location with easy bus and train links to downtown as well as all the major tourist locations. The living space was light and airy with great-sized bedrooms and a fabulous central living space and was equipped with everything we needed for our stay. Off-street parking was a real bonus and will fit a large car by English standards (ford focus or similar). We didn't get chance to meet Daniel but his communication by email was great and we felt very welcome the whole time we were there.
5345792,338882998,2018-10-20,201242795,Rogier,"Beautiful very clean placelocated on top of a hill. The best bed and pillows! Amazing view and walking distance to dolores park and valencia street with lots of nice trendy restaurants and bars.
Would def go there again."
3877462,26116447,2015-02-03,1535607,Michael,"I think that the best thing that I could write is that my stay at Carly's place was so good that the next time I needed a room in SF I wasn't looking for any other options and stayed here for the second time.

If you are reading this you need not look any further just book the room."
20994570,572709439,2019-12-03,157842123,Joel,Place was perfect for my wife and I and our dog ! Private entry and easy access ! Would definitely stay here again!
915058,488249861,2019-07-14,155165363,Clayton,Enjoyed the amazing views of San Francisco and colorful home.  It was my first time in the Bernal Heights area and they had a binder full of various places to eat/drink.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in SF.
8105974,281448659,2018-06-24,3259215,Olivia,This was my 5th stay at Lisa & Simone's amazing listing. As always I had a great time the place was clean and located in an amazing neighbourhood. I get to wake up every morning walk across the street to get my morning latte which I enjoy on my walk to work. After work I can easily grab a bite to eat at any of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood and enjoy the view from the balcony as my coworker and I sip on some delicious wine. 
17534690,203003048,2017-10-13,11244122,Sin Kun,"It was pleasant staying at Hu's place. very quite neighborhood with convenient location. 
Besides having hard time figuring out where the heater is it was great place to stay. *heater is a small box right next to the TV*"
22548614,319193113,2018-09-05,2419389,Ben,We had an amazing 1 night stay at Judy’s. The room is spacious and the house is sparkling clean. We just wish we had more time to spend there...
1056844,74437665,2016-05-15,65446013,Kate,Chantal gave easy clear instructions about public transport and getting to her place. The apartment is a lovely light-filled space within easy walking distance of many sights. The sofa is very comfortable. I didn't see much of Chantal during my stay but she was very helpful when I needed her guidance. Thanks Chantal - you have a great home.
1409218,7656999,2013-09-28,747534,Ashish,"Great apartment in a great location. I was there for OpenWorld and was able to easily walk to Moscone. 

Alex was a great host!"
1767543,19355751,2014-09-11,5292565,Neal,the apartment was in an excellent location among lovely old buildings.everything you could need was providedroom was spacious and clean.a car is not essential but was useful to get around as most of the main attractions were a good walk away.the painted ladies were nice but if you take a stroll around the nearby streets you would find many prittier houses.overall a perfect location and a perfect apartment. 
27960744,436294374,2019-04-12,122438158,Lateefa,I came for business but between the patio the neighborhood and the actual residence itself it felt like I was on a mini-vacation. You can tell from the space Rosalinda and Dennis have put a lot of thought into making your stay comfortable and convenient. They were lovely attentive hosts and I'll definitely be staying again next time I'm in town.
14488234,142543594,2017-04-08,34483125,Pamela,I'd book with them again in a heartbeat. Perfect location accommodating hosts and gorgeous house. The room is small but has a great set up with large screen tv and closet space. I only stayed there for a night but if I had been there longer I would have taken advantage of the large kitchen. 
8524982,187219663,2017-08-26,61773571,Daniel,Extremely clean and well maintained room lovely shower room too. Wonderful setting; great views from stunning balcony (but SF is cooler than we thought so take sweatshirts!). Pier 39 is 10 mins away & location of accommodation is perfect. Shane was really helpful & accommodating. We'd recommend staying here.
15832358,324332779,2018-09-16,12394687,Caroline,Amazing location on a quiet/beautiful street that still offers you access to public transit/bars/restaurants/etc. I was in SF for a long stay and truly felt at home in David's space. The room was just what I needed to unwind after long days of work/rehearsals. Check in was extremely easy and David was helpful and kind. Truly great spot!
1351626,95699543,2016-08-20,63349918,Igor,I stayed with Phyllis for about 3 months. Almost immediately I felt as if I was at home (even though there was a dinner party about 3 hours after I arrived). Overall it was a good experience.
11659435,331092579,2018-10-01,20039066,Che,Loren’s place was a perfect hideaway within the big city. Great walkable neighborhood and close enough to major attractions in the city.
4607177,87908273,2016-07-22,8903471,Marisa,Lindsay’s house was just perfect and a big part of why I enjoyed this most recent work trip to San Francisco. The place is just as pictured complete with comfortable bed and wine/beer/chocolate/welcome note. This location was ideal for me because while it is a close walk (down a steep hill!) to great coffee shops and food the fact that it is near the top of Telegraph Hill means that it’s so much quieter than other places I’ve stayed in the city; a perfect sanctuary after a busy day in the city. Lindsay was an ideal host and her house was exactly what I was looking for. I would highly recommend her place and definitely plan on staying there again when I’m back in San Francisco! 
12172311,329369110,2018-09-28,205785908,Brittany,Must stay!!!!!!
14422371,253229195,2018-04-13,133313788,Suzanne,Visitors should be aware that this is hostel type accommodation and possibly not suitable for families. It can be hard to get into the bathroom at certain times and children can't wait long. There is public transport about 5 minutes away but it's a dark and secluded walk back and I would not feel comfortable doing it as single woman. However for such an expensive city it offers affordable friendly accommodation.
1203172,29100918,2015-04-04,27267566,Lowri,"Rachael and John were absolutely fantastic hosts!!! They were both really friendly warm genuine and inviting and gave my partner and I recommendations and suggestions for places to visit in San Francisco including restaurants and lovely places to walk/sight see. They went above and beyond expectations by getting in touch with friends to find someone to take us a location outside of the city when we wanted to go and gave us a ride within the city when one of our cabs failed to show up which was very touching. 
The room was spacious clean and very comfortable and in a safe and quiet neighbourhood. The breakfasts we had each day were also delicious and included home-baked muffins! The chocolate and peanut butter muffins are awesome!:)). Could not recommend more highly. Thanks so much for such a wonderful first experience with airbnb."
15843930,115566997,2016-11-25,676141,Kat,We needed a place to stay over Thanksgiving for 2 families. It was large enough to fit of all us had a great kitchen for cooking and the location was awesome- close to a park shops public transport. Sierra was super friendly and responsive. The photos don't do the place justice. Would totally recommend this place and would love to stay again. 
16256385,163087407,2017-06-23,122527171,Abigail,Freddi was a wonderful host! She was incredibly accommodating to our schedule and so friendly. It was my first time in SF and she really made the treat suite feel like home. Her house is gorgeous and the Mission is the perfect place to stay in as well with local restaurants coffee shops and more. I would highly highly recommend Freddi's place if you're staying in SF! I plan on staying at Freddi's again when I go back to the Bay area. 
1482730,61371913,2016-02-03,27596564,Beth,Jen was an excellent host. The apartment was unbelievably clean neat and comfy. She even lent us her museum passes so we could take our son to the Academy of Sciences! The house is just two blocks off the main street in Bernal Heights that has lots of delicious restaurants a couple fun bars and even a tiny but well appointed grocery store.

2933899,20170917,2014-09-24,21525110,Roddy,Essentially a large hotel room at much lower rates! The Donatello has a 24 hour front desk so I had no problem picking up or dropping off keys.  The room was large and clean with a comfortable bed and separate bathroom.  Full privacy just like a hotel.  The location is good -- very near Union Square. Dana was responsive and easy to deal with.  I would definitely stay here again! 
33021274,520593852,2019-08-30,90717401,Arthur,This place was perfect! Right in the middle of Downton San Francisco for a fraction of the price! A block away from the Powell and Hyde cable car stop!
6600081,500132216,2019-08-01,13794691,Chris,Stylish sparklingly clean and very comfortable spot near the Mission and Potrero Hill. Del and her family were wonderful welcoming hosts who provided lots of amenities and local tips.

2042095,50290822,2015-10-11,1417946,Paul,Bruce and Lawrence made us feel very welcome Bruce picked us up at the Glen Park Bart station and drove us up the hill to their place.  And the place itself is beautiful with a drop dead gorgeous view of Baghdad by the Bay.  
6336315,427066186,2019-03-22,236799121,Tyler,Robert was an outstanding host. I found him helpful and accommodating and his willingness to share his knowledge about getting around in the city was valuable. His home is immaculate and its proximity to downtown was ideal for me.
6092596,334683610,2018-10-09,22996303,Angel,"This space is perfect for any traveler looking to explore the Mission District! It’s within walking distance to lots of local shops dining and of course Mission Dolores Park! You won’t run out of things to do. 

The bed in this cozy suite is also one of the most comfortable beds I’ve slept on at any AirBnB so Marc is definitely doing something right! I would definitely love to stay again when I’m in the city."
15330751,554118950,2019-10-25,5437009,Geraldine,Very large room & very quiet clean flat great welcome (jing drove me through the neighborhood the first day to show me where everything is) easy check-in good recommendation for food & drinks near by lovely area... I recommend jing’s place
23567834,303095541,2018-08-06,80254657,Anne,This is a clean comfortable apartment with new furnishings. The location is wonderful. We appreciated our host who was warm and friendly.

6430646,130563943,2017-02-06,37796688,Nicholas,Great stay in an ideal location. The room was lovely and David made it very easy to come and go.
16256385,206986409,2017-10-27,31042891,Darlene & Dan,We came to visit a part of San Francisco we hadn’t explored before. Freddi’s house was great. We enjoyed our stay. We especially enjoyed the resaurant’s in the neighborhood. Too many to pick so I guess we’ll be back.  Cheers
10638522,442099561,2019-04-22,19204822,Shawn,Comfortable apartment in a great location.  Neighborhood has so much to see and do - and all within walking distance!  You can't go wrong!
25547908,281896499,2018-06-25,65981502,Carolina,Great space that's very nicely located. The room and house were clean. Parking is difficult since it's on-street parking and it's hard to find space. 
4695477,32606488,2015-05-19,6362565,Pedro,"Maria's place is great. 
It is placed in a very nice neighborhood very close to the golden gate park and Haight-Ashbury. Also there is a metro station quite close to the house (maybe 5min walking) that can take you downtown if needed.
The house look very nice and so does our room. It was a very comfortable and pleasing stay."
15215678,189704930,2017-09-02,112759332,Pippa,Gorgeous studio . The studio is easy to locate from airport and close to all public transport links for Bay Area . The standard of accommodation is excellent ; clean  tidy full of everything you need and more. We loved the communication from Steve and Jennifer they are always on hand via email to help . I stayed with my 12 yr old son and it was perfect for us both. We would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting the Bay Area and would love to stay again sometime . Lovely safe and friendly area too with lovely local shops ; restaurants and parks within walking distance
2123469,21793362,2014-10-24,15718427,Thomas,"If you want to stay in San Francisco  experience a real neighbourhood with lots going on close to some major attractions but not be stuck in the middle of a tourist trap then this is for you. Viviane and Lele (and Milo) are simply the perfect hosts. Friendly warm kind and helpful. Amazing local knowledge and the house is lovely and cosy. If you want to access the city centre and bay area then it's cheap easy and quick. 
The house is right by golden gate park and easy walking distance to the start of Haight street. There are some great little local coffee shops restaurants and bars where real local people actually go. 
When I go back I will most certainly be staying with them. .. I just hope they aren't fully booked :)
Truly wonderful people and my first San Francisco experience was perfect because of them."
467507,19065587,2014-09-06,5816105,Anthony,"We returned to Gorgeous Bernal Heights as we had a great experience last time we visited and we were not disappointed.

We had a warm welcome from Jennifer on arrival.

The flat is perfect for our needs. It is super clean and cosy. All that we needed for kitchen bathroom seating telephone was on hand - plus gifts in the fridge!!

The location was great with easy access to MUNI and routes into and out of the city. Plus lots of local information on hand as booklets and pamphlets in case we got stuck.

We were very happy throughout our stay and will be looking to return again in the future

748222,4781336,2013-05-25,513405,Stacie,I had a great experience staying here.  It's very convenient to walk anywhere in the mission district.  Within two minutes of walking out the front door I came across a farmer's market which was a nice surprise.  The room was clean and comfortable.  
13265498,489955393,2019-07-17,275447335,Rafael,Very easy check-in and check-out! Great looking rooms and great price. Would highly recommend!
2062696,457712068,2019-05-24,66107483,Tomo,Had a lovely time! Would stay here again :)
2496086,32912077,2015-05-23,128592,Ashley,Victor was an amazing host. His place was comfy and clean! My family and I felt right at home in his gorgeous apartment. The views were spectacular better than the photos. 
18765944,468099331,2019-06-11,126833130,Hae,It was much cleaner than I expected and I really like how coffee breakfast and snacks are provided. Victor and Christiana were quick to respond when I messaged them.
14426130,456908490,2019-05-22,151099689,Katie,David’s place was great! He has a very cool home in a cool little corner of San Francisco. There were cool shops and excellent restaurants (Sea breeze Cafe has the most amazing potatoes and breakfast food and a really sweet couple runs the place) within a few minute walk. The room was nicely decorated with thoughtful touches and the house has a great flow. Parking was a bit tricky but we made it work without having to walk that far to get to and from our rental car. It’s quite far from downtown if that is what you’re looking for but it worked well for us since we were only there for a short time and wanted to see other non-downtown sights. It’s close to the Golden Gate Park which I think is a must see and there was ample free street parking within the park.  We didn’t interact with David that much since we were out all day each day but he gave us a warm welcome and great advice and he has the sweetest pup! My only suggestion is maybe to put a mirror in the room above the desk since I felt bad hogging the bathroom to do my makeup. And maybe a small fan since the room was pretty quite and got a bit warm. Overall a great stay for us and we would stay again. It was also quite close to the ocean which was cool too. Oh and the bed and pillows were super comfortable.
17438541,563993684,2019-11-14,45475695,Katie,The space was much larger than we expected. Large bedrooms and nice bathroom. Quick and friendly communication throughout.
2944843,319557656,2018-09-06,207973806,Marco,Janaf is a communicative and lovely host. She waked up early in the morning to prepare a generous breakfast for the 3 of us. Her homemade felafel is delicious. The room is clean and well furnished. Thanks !
431632,275373555,2018-06-10,11826011,Glen,"I got this place for my mom to visit as I live a few blocks away. As you can imagine a place for my mother is way more important to me than one for myself. That said this is a super safe comfy and convenient spot for anyone.  Yes there is some noise from the family upstairs. You may notice it more because everything else is so quiet. Personally I like to hear sounds of life around me. It makes me feel normal. I only got to meet Brian and he was a super nice guy.  Probably the biggest consideration is the location as it is in The Richmond - awesome relatively safe neighborhood of SF great for Golden Gate Bridge Ocean Beach China Beach and Baker Beach. Not exactly a party spot like the Haight. 
I cannot recommend this place more. I hope to have my family stay here again."
10379560,414785815,2019-02-20,43279955,Manobalan,Good place for beach side lovers a good host and the place was clean and well equipped. Has a private entry it almost felt like we were in a private home.
166199,142524543,2017-04-08,52274034,Younseon,good
3325741,67351844,2016-03-28,62554554,Jin,Robert is very friendly and sincere. He respects my privacy and manages his dogs from barking. The house is in a quiet and nice neighborhood. The house is full of artsy paintings that I felt like living in a gallery. I enjoyed staying in Robert's place.
501770,21247708,2014-10-13,12939929,Kyle,Accurate description. Pictures tell you everything. Great location!
21295261,464084098,2019-06-04,147949209,Tian,It is apparent that Dayne and Bekah have put a tremendous amount of love and care into their old San Francisco house and we were so grateful that there were so many shared spaces in their home that they were willing to open up to their guests. They provided clear and thorough instructions that made our stay so easy!
32847389,456855976,2019-05-22,14439421,Avra,Beautiful View
23699151,322279668,2018-09-12,4517005,Ryan,Excellent hotel full-time staff 24/7 and even a gym jazz bar restaurant concierge etc all inside the building. My room also had a small kitchenette area for storing cold food wine glasses and so on. This is now my go-to accommodation whenever I visit San Francisco. Just 2 mins walk to Union Square too.
1030352,12652273,2014-05-07,662915,Kathryn,Mel and Ry are awesome with great communication pre booking and during our stay they're the perfect host's I'd happily deal with every time. The house is amazing those bed are dangerous extremely comfortable you'll never want to leave them. We had 3 people staying and the house was ample amount of space big bright and airy with great art to look at we can't complain it was a perfect stay. With 24th st right around the corner you'll never be short of amazing places to eat. A place I'll highly recommend. Thanks again for the hospitality. 
1759087,536926265,2019-09-27,34530292,Taavi,A great space way bigger than the SF hotel rooms I've stayed in. The bed was soft and the place was pretty quiet. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. I wish I'd had time to watch a sunset on the back deck.
1428465,7676092,2013-09-29,4882800,Danny,"This was the best decision we made. My wife and I love visiting SF and decided to give AirBnB a try. I'm so glad we did. We found Rachels apartment more than perfect! The apartment is spacious clean modern and very cozy. 

Booking was super easy. Rachels response time to any and all questions I had were fast and on time. She is a great host and knows the area well so she is great at giving advice on places to eat and drink. 

I highly recommend this home to anyone looking to have a good time and feel like you never left home. "
7309852,44184256,2015-08-24,23868953,Brian And Chari,Awesome location.  Everything you need is just a short walk away.  Apartment was very clean and comfortable.  Hosts were great
7026287,256817702,2018-04-23,83235347,Jaclyn,We had an amazing stay at Melissa and Nicole’s place! It was clean and a perfect space. They answered within minutes anytime we had a question or needed anything offered suggestions but also provided privacy. They were located in Noe Valley which was an awesome quaint part of San Francisco! Would definitely stay here again!

8053887,170145710,2017-07-14,52732822,Sabine,Charmante großzügige und saubere Wohnung in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet. Busanbindung funktioniert gut und wir hatten auch keinerlei Probleme einen Parkplatz für unseren riesigen SUV vor der Haustür zu finden. Nachts könnten wir die Schiebetür zur Terasse offen lassen da der Garten von anderen Gärten umgeben und nicht von außen zugänglich ist. Nach diversen Nächten in Motels mit Klimaanlagen haben wir das besonders genossen. Übergabe der Wohnung durch Louise verlief absolut unkompliziert und sympathisch! Sehr empfehlenswert!
2088622,261699668,2018-05-06,52513783,Leticia,My stay at Kenix's house was great. Me and my husband stayed there for 4 nights and everything went well. The hosts are easy to communicate  the space was very clean and the house is in a safe neighborhood. It's not so close to the main tourists attractions but the area is well covered by public transport and we had no problem at all. Thanks for hosting us!
24723,327954625,2018-09-24,200895466,William,Super cute super well appointed comfy roomy place. Highly recommended! Extremely easy to find and access. Safe quiet charming street. Lots of places to walk to fantastic location helpful hosts excellent value. All good stuff!
3081324,166845067,2017-07-04,27761166,Tatyana,Carrie's place is exactly as pictured and described. Great place close to enough to the inner city but far enough where it's nice and quiet. Carrie was great with any questions we had and was a great host. Home was beautiful with an incredible selection of artwork. Definitely would recommend.
24086446,547668713,2019-10-15,76989123,Abdulhakeem,The people that I had lived with were professional and management was kind. It very much felt like a college dorm but more professional. I'm not going to tell you that everything is sparkling clean but I do believe that this place is of great value given its price in SF.
20217846,412109941,2019-02-14,40421275,Todd,Great place Would definitely rent again!
31964427,442913839,2019-04-24,776630,Amrith,"Great accommodations and a very responsive host! We just spent 2 nights at Camille’s place - we had the downstairs portion. The upstairs (where the common area is for the kitchen and laundry) has a few other rooms rented out to other guests. Camille has done a good job of posting notes reminding guests to be mindful of noise after 8pm which was helpful. 
Overall it’s a very clean and stylish space and Camille did a great job communicating frequently and providing clear instructions. Would definitely recommend."
23550791,419380855,2019-03-03,215391618,Ag,Hi Sat Thank you so much for your hospitality. This is my best stay so far I have to say like 5 star hotels. And Sat and Geary are also very helpful. I enjoyed the breakfast indeed. I stayed at Sat’s house for 5 nights. At the first three days I got cold and not feel well at all I hope my bad cough at night did not bother anybody. A big hug to you. 
1624068,64359021,2016-03-03,25912725,Ronen,The stay was amazing. Practically like staying at a hotel and a nice one at that. They even have a TV in the bathroom mirror. Overall I would recommend.
5070945,132228295,2017-02-16,8606503,Chris,Great stay everything was clean and just what I needed for my stay.
4902855,96901975,2016-08-25,85952044,Ana,Tony makes me feel like home. The bedroom was exactly how he showed me. It is a clean place with good bathroom and kitchen. There you can find everything that do you need for your stay. Thank you for the hospitality! 
9532943,145750187,2017-04-19,17383508,Dipendra,Great location . Tony was a great host. Very easy to cimmunicate with
53934,47169839,2015-09-16,19053888,Joon,This was a great 2-bedroom place in the heart of the city and at the price we paid it was a steal! The apartment was clean all amenities provided for and even a nice bottle of wine to welcome us. Manny and Megan were fantastic hosts responding to and answering every little question we had and providing a detailed guide to the city. You're literally a $6-8 cab ride from all major city attractions and walking distance from some amazing bars and restaurants. Will be sure to return! 
3290739,243638686,2018-03-16,35326928,Morgan,Alison and Mark’s place is a great deal! My boyfriend and I were a little nervous because we have never stayed in a private room. However we were given so much privacy the entire time. The hosts were efficient and even accommodated our late check-in.   A perfect stay and if you book this place you will not regret it!
19365066,264389000,2018-05-13,5394363,Renato,Great host and wonderful apartment!Amazing location with everything you need at walking distance! AAA+
1920033,368948617,2019-01-08,59605974,Sean,Kevin knows how to run an AirBNB. Flight-attendant style check-in walkthrough. We were able to check-in early for a fee which was worth it for the convenience. The apartment is in a quiet area on a small street and you can walk to a lot of food in about 20 minutes. There is a quite a selection of breakfast food available included. The beds are comfortable and clean and the bathroom has what you need. The border collie is loud when you enter so if you are afraid of dogs make sure to tell Kevin. I have a dog allergy and didn't sniffle or sneeze too much once in the room. Note that Kevin rents out another room in the apartment so there may be others staying. Overall great place.
21057777,210687846,2017-11-10,125174825,Adrian,Lovely apartment very modern and clean. Great location. Tiffany and Rob are extremely helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
12025717,216426001,2017-12-03,132038167,Dominic,Great little place to stay with plenty of rooms and not too far from the nightlife.
114401,227678757,2018-01-15,15601556,Sharalee,"I stayed at George's place on a whim. I knew I wanted to explore the Mission District and he was the closest place left that looked acceptable. 

The following is my list of cons: 

1) The bed is too darn comfortable. I seriously had trouble getting out of it in the morning.

2) I was unaware there was street parking. I ended up using public  transportation within walking distance to the house and explored the 
whole city. 
 
 3) When I woke George was nowhere to be found (went to church).  I wandered into the kitchen to find the coffee pot set up waiting for the button to be pushed along with some  yummy danish to eat.

4) George would not take no for an answer when he offered to drive me to the Legion of Honor Museum. He even let me borrow his pass. Who does 
this?

5) George's fur ball feline was so respectful of guests that I had to seek her out in order to get some love and then there was no turning back.   

Anyway...You get the picture. I had a wonderful time and George is a great host and obviously cares about the comfort of his guest even if  it means giving them privacy. The neighborhood is quiet yet close to shops eateries and transportation. Enjoy!"
585225,343195793,2018-10-30,166766753,Judith,We really enjoyed staying at Gabriels’ place.  The apartment was super cozy and clean. Gabe is a perfect host. The communication was super friendly and the response very quick. Check in as well as ckeck out were very simple and fast. The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood with a bus station just around the corner so it is easy to getting downtown. We really can recommend this place.
4936887,91566037,2016-08-05,41053174,Matt,A huge beautifully furnished apartment in a great location. Pool ping-pong and a piano too. Great communication and a perfect base for our family of 4 to explore SF. We managed to cook one evening in the kitchenette and were spoilt for choice in terms of places to eat out.
32712890,493652994,2019-07-22,276592292,Kayleen,This place was amazing! It was my first time staying at an air bnb and it was such a great experience. The room and the entire house was very clean comfortable quiet and safe! The exterior of the house is also super cute and was not hard to distinguish which one it is at night (house number was lit up)! The check in/out and key situation was very easy and Shaun responds quick to messages. This place is not too far from the tourist place most people go see as you think it might be and it’s about 18 minutes (by car) away from Fisherman’s Wharf. There are a couple of rooms for other guests in the house and if you are out exploring all day like I was you don’t really interact with them or hear them. You do have to share 2 bathrooms with the other guests but they remained clean the entire time and wasn’t as weird as you might think it will be. Shaun also provides towels shampoo conditioner and body wash which is great if you are only traveling with carry-ons. There are hangers to hang up your clothes heaters portable fan extra blankets a full body mirror and two pillows on each bed that gives you the option of having a more firm or a more squishy pillow! You also get access to the living room and kitchen. There is also a washing machine down stairs and a dryer that you have to put coins in but it is very convenient. His guide book is helpful and gives a lot of good tips and suggestions on what to do in San Francisco.  I would recommend this place to my friends and family due to Shaun making house super helpful convenient comfortable clean and safe!
14762607,181420031,2017-08-12,106409385,Marshall,Ryan's apartment is exceptional. Everything is 100% accurate that is posted and even more. Such a great neighborhood and a perfect location to anything in the City. Thanks Ryan! I would highly recommend

114401,317901648,2018-09-02,200479198,Ayrton,George is a wonderful host! He made me feel welcome from beginning to end! Very flexible with check in and check out times. Definitely recommend him if you’re in the SF area!
44032,25928044,2015-01-30,22750865,Anna & Julien,"The secret lounge is a great stopover in San Francisco. The studio is exactly as described very comfortable and well furnished. What we especially loved was the light which is amazing all day long in the studio. Everything worked perfectly and was well-explained to us by our hosts (email). 
And of course one of the most exciting thing about the place is its location the neighborhood is just great walking distance to very nice restaurants and dives. Next to the bart station which goes to the embarcadero chinatown and Powell (great place to shop!). All in all the perfect place to get a real taste of SF. In spite of the very lively and entertaining surroundings the street itself is silent and we slept really well. Best of both worlds really. 
We will definitely go back to the secret lounge whenever we come back to SF!"
12779748,128436483,2017-01-24,33524507,Katherine,"I can't believe it's taken us this long to discover Bartlett's Bunkhouse because we visit SF often and it's an incredible value. Clean efficient close to virtually everything (an 8-minute walk to the Moscone Center and within a couple of blocks of Westfield and tons of shopping and delicious food) the amenities you NEED when traveling and great customer service. The overhead light wasn't working when we checked in and the guy at the front desk had it fixed in short order.

We especially liked the fact that we could come and go freely without bothering anyone and there was a safe in the room. 

Not a lot of frills but the frills are unnecessary. The vibe is warm and friendly. Really enjoyed our stay here."

1738415,255187148,2018-04-19,145455909,Lora,Donna’s place was lovely good space for 2-4 people and very centrally located. We found getting around really easy on Muni which is close by. It’s on a quiet street that isn’t a thoroughfare which was really nice. Cafe and restaurant down the road were cute and close. Donna was lovely and even gave us some clipper cards to use on the public transport. Highly recommend.  Only downside was some noise from footsteps above.
2694526,92463670,2016-08-08,190821,Joseph,"Viviane and Lele were terrific hosts: friendly and helpful but not hovering. And Milo (their dog) was a charmer! Their home and the Beach Retreat room were exactly as described: very clean and comfortable with a lot of character. Check-in and out was efficient and smooth. and communication was clear and prompt. The rental is very close to Golden Gate park and there are numerous neighborhood restaurants grocery stores local gym nearby etc. I had a wonderful experience and would definitely stay again!

7922690,115727595,2016-11-26,51261064,Anatashia,This was a great place to stay for our thanksgiving weekend about 20 minutes drive to downtown San Francisco and super close to friends and family's houses. Super convenient. The place was nice and clean and communicating with Emmanuel was a breeze he would reply instantly and welcomed us nicely despite the change in schedule. 
4519757,121744160,2016-12-18,105134260,Yuki,It's good for visitors!
15486470,277145797,2018-06-15,159632750,Rob,"We needed a spot in the heart of town where four people could each have their own space for a work trip and Suzanne's place was perfect! Definitely a good value as opposed to trying to house four people in a hotel and just a few minutes' drive to the Moscone Center (or a ~35 minute walk when we were feeling active).

Suzanne was highly responsive and very helpful as well -- great stay thank you!"
7181279,169510191,2017-07-12,13626498,Dennis,Super godt udnyttet lille lejlighed dejlig ren og i ikke alt for lang afstand fra SF centrum. Lokalområdet på Bernal bakkerne med udsigt over byen er flot og miljøet omkring nærliggende Cortland Street er en hyggelig perle. Det er også tæt på det mexicanske Mission distrikt. Man får ikke meget plads for pengene og der er for eksempel ikke komfur i lejligheden men det er super udnyttet. En helt klar anbefaling herfra.

Por otro lado tal vez se puedan impresionar los vagabundos de la zona; sin embargo es un lugar tranquilo y hay lugares en los alrededores para comer bien (y para todos los presupuestos) y lugares para rentar autos Descubran San Francisco"
22812395,548048060,2019-10-16,105719148,DeFord,What a cozy place in a nice neighborhood with great hospitality! Marie went above and beyond in accomodating us while we were in the area for a family member's hospital stay.  Breakfast   a welcome goody box  snacks in the fridge all added to the enjoyment of our stay.  We will come back and enjoy this lovely spot when we can do some sightseeing! Highly recommended.
5863674,491862130,2019-07-20,31852740,Khalida,Wonderful stay with a thoughtful host! Gilmar was warm and attentive and his place was absolutely stunning.
680288,22279001,2014-11-02,5761939,DeAndre,"Ken and Richard were both amazingly humble and welcoming. The apartment was adorable and in a perfect part of the city. You can quickly tell when you first arrive that they have had many guests and know how to best tell their guest what their neighborhoods biggest attractions are (talking about you philz coffee). The patio and back yard are beautiful and were perfect for a nice breakfast outside.

The only complaint me and my girlfriend had was the bed. It was an old school bed that consisted of two parts that made it a little difficult for two people to sleep on without one of them slipping into the middle. the mattresses were uncomfortably firm as well

Overall this was by far our best air bnb experience and if me and the gf ever need a place to stay in SF again ken will be the first person we contact. "
728585,61765453,2016-02-08,47617859,Rick,It's a very sweet cottage which is as comfortable as home we really loved it. Also Doug is a great host. Thanks for the fruit in the room.
4106442,60490190,2016-01-24,4514741,Kate,Samantha's place in the Mission was in a fabulous location for access to 24th and Valencia and Dolores Park. We walked up to Haight and over Potrero Hill too. Very welcoming to our dog which was really fabulous as it can be difficult to travel with companion species and so marvellous when it works out. Samantha made us all feel welcome and provided some lovely treats for dogs and people alike. 
7699276,524824257,2019-09-06,4508648,Scott,Matthew was very prompt in replies and very clear on instructions for the place.  The bed was super comfortable and it’s great walking distance to Castro St.  Really liked that it was close but on a quiet street.
11437138,444310263,2019-04-27,25520749,Kevin,I have nothing but nice things to say about Maria. Maria is a wonderful host with a beautiful home. She and her beautiful dog Sequoia will make you feel right at home but the heated toilet seats will make you feel like royalty.
17405370,194060355,2017-09-15,22560214,Tahlia,We've stayed at a lot of Airbnbs and Peter and Monica's place is a standout. The house itself is newly renovated exceptionally clean and self-contained with large comfortable beds and a great kitchen. The location is also perfect - close to many attractions including Fishermans Wharf Lombard Street and bike hire locations to cycle over the Golden Gate Bridge. The house borders the suburb of Russian Hill which has a great high street - Polk Street. We spent a bit of time here for lunch/dinner (recommend Blue Barn) and really good coffee. Peter and Monica themselves were great hosts - they met us on arrival and helped with our luggage into the house which was such a blessing. They had a bottle of prosecco waiting for us on arrival (perfect for our girls holiday!!) and lots of useful information and recommendations for San Francisco. They were always easily contactable and happy to assist. I could not recommend this place more highly. Thanks again for the great stay!
352165,21660846,2014-10-21,5224480,Bodo,Very nice cozy basement apartment that has a perfect location right within SF's Castro area. We had a great time and could use the apartment as a convenient take-off point to explore the awesome surroundings. The hosts were super-nice! Thanks so much.
15471757,422665172,2019-03-11,12550492,Lilly,Great place to stay for a first timer in SF. Responsive host. Cool housemates. Next to one of the best views in the city.

The location is perfect because it is walking distance to the beach and golden gate park. If you need local groceries there's also a safeway closeby as well as some chinese resturants (Cheung Hing for duck!). Jennifer was very responsive and provided with everything that we needed. Highly recommend if you are visiting SF!
2965433,177668903,2017-08-03,23153259,Cornelia,Wonderful experience. This is the nicest place I've ever been to. Very spacious and comfortable apartment with everything you need. And it is just a few steps from lots of Restaurants and cafes near Washington Square für several Busses our you Can Jump on to the Cable car just at the corner. And the best is Sharone is such a great host so Friendly and helpful with everything! She answered lots of questions and always so quickly  she is a very charming person and we thank her a lot for everything. we hope to come back one day.
1738415,26541506,2015-02-15,26450500,Christina,"We stayed here over Valentine's Day weekend. Donna greeted us at the door and gave us a tour of her lovely apartment. The space was quite larger than the pictures suggested which was a nice surprise as was the second bathroom. It was also a treat to look out over the garden with a cup of tea in the morning.

The neighborhood was cute quiet and provided super easy access to Hayes Street. It was about a 20 minute walk to The Mission. For longer trips we just requested an Uber. 

Donna was nice enough to lend us one of her cookie sheets when we decided to make a pizza one evening. 

Overall a great stay. It was nice to feel like we had a home away from home for a few days."
24489443,564397908,2019-11-15,15524061,Dan,Ko may just be my favorite Airbnb host of all time. He is easy-going kind and quick to communicate with spot-on recommendations from an SF local's perspective. The place is great; half a block away from Mission Bartlett Garage (cheap safe parking). Local shops within walking distance and Ritual Coffee just across the street. Hope to return soon!
26339979,432367770,2019-04-03,29075878,Renee,GREAT location quiet neighborhood easy to find parking and walking distance to the beach. It's only a mile away from Golden Gate Park and Lands End. I was able to get decent coffee at Andytown Coffee and Trouble Coffee. The space is private spacious and clean. I can tell the owner put a lot of thoughts and personal touches into it - such as heated bathroom floor and special night light. The bed was super comfortable and I had a really good night of sleep after a long drive. Overall it was a great deal for me and I will totally come back again.

We spent a fabulous week at Luis' lovely apartment.
Luis is kind and warm it was like visiting an old friend.
The location and neighbourhood are just perfect.
It is close to Castro Mission Haight.  Near the action 
but on a small beautifull and quiet street.
It felt like being part and living in San Francisco.
We cannot wait to return!"
27555509,365868178,2019-01-01,220547104,Shane,This was my first time using Airbnb and Jessica made it an amazing experience! From her quick responses tips on local attractions to the amazing hospitality shown this stay was the perfect way to start my trip. I’ll definitely be staying here the next time I’m in San Francisco... couldn’t have asked for a better experience.
555596,108851252,2016-10-17,92485724,Sean,"A wonderful experience in Noe Valley!  Judy was a great host with an excellent apartment.  You really cannot beat the hospitality location and price with this listing.
The property is on a steep hill but access to the apartment itself is a wonderful walk through Judy's gardens and you are rewarded with a spectacular view straight down to the Bay Bridge.  With the front two walls of windows you are treated to a beautiful view of the garden and city below.
The apartment was as promised and appointed with all the necessities. Judy even offered milk for the morning coffee that was provided!  I stayed there with my mother (she got the bed) and I slept on the pullout sofa.  It's not the most luxurious mattress in the world but definitely did the job.
Overall it is a great place that I have already recommended to other travelers headed that way!"
6684182,543858848,2019-10-08,34702404,Katie,Shea’s place was a great option for our family of 4 adults and 2 children.  The large backyard space is hard to find in SF and was great for the nice weather we had in October.  We walked to Philz coffee most mornings and took advantage of Urban Putt only a block away. The location is great and the house feels open and historic with tall ceilings and ample space.  The house feels lived in but that makes sense in the SF housing market.  I would recommend Shea’s place to other guests.
6543813,253233208,2018-04-13,1761224,Brian,As might be evident from the fact that I've stayed here a number of times and I continue to enjoy it very much. Leonard has become a good friend. Very genuine gregarious and caring.
53934,1619050,2012-07-03,1658073,Lucila,Megan and Mannie are wonderful hosts!! I didn't spend much time in the apartment but the time I spent there was great! I would totally recommend others to stay in the Rainbow Room you will have an excelent experience!

He and his wife were very good at any questions we had about San Francisco. The place is about 20 mins from the city but there’s a great ramen place to walk to from the house. It was a great experience!
30960144,531103488,2019-09-16,10627721,Matt,Love this place so much I barely wanted to leave. It was a great touch being neighbors with Airbnb HQ for the weekend. I really can’t wait to stay there again!

Anreiseinformationen wurden vorab geschickt. Einziger Verbesserungspunkt wäre der Austausch des Teppichbodens in den Schlafzimmern gegen einen besser zu reinigenden Untergrund(Fliesen Holz oder Laminat)."

Marcia laisse dans la chambre  des explications tres détaillées pour aller dans différents endroits et aussi du café et plein de petits snacks. Nous avions la chambre bleue qui comprend tout ce qu'il faut y compris frigo et micro-ondes. La salle de bains est partagée avec l'autre chambre louée et Marcia vit a l'étage en-dessous.

Hotel quality beds as well as all sorts of amenities like coffee tea oatmeal chewy bars AND ghiradelli chocolate squares. YUM. The place was super cute and cozy when we got in. The pull out bed was also made up really nicely! My friends had a great time staying here and it's pretty close to all the fun stuff to do in SF.  
8869066,338132289,2018-10-18,15319604,Lucas,The location of this Airbnb is TOP NOTCH. It was so nice to be able to grab a cup of coffee every morning from the Philz around the corner and easily get around the city via walking. I was here for work and had a rental car with me that was easily parked on the street right in front of the Airbnb. The space was comfortable and very convenient. All in all I would definitely recommend this spot for either a work trip or personal trip.

4215907,28402140,2015-03-23,26742649,Bobby,LayKoon's suite exceeded our expectations and was the perfect place to retreat back to after a long day of sight seeing. The description that it is spacious clean and quiet really holds true! We loved having the cozy living room to hang out in and the kitchen was perfect for heating up a quick dinner. The water pressure in the shower is great! Definitely a pleasant surprise. LayKoon herself was helpful and her suite guide had tons of handy info on how to navigate the neighborhood and city. This was our first airbnb experience and it set the bar high!

1393654,78591360,2016-06-07,13633431,Bradley,"Kevin's home was everything I could have asked for during my too-short visit to San Fransisco. It was quiet had a spectacular view from its back porch and above all Kevin was very accommodating and quick to answer any questions I had. 

I hadn't stayed at an airbnb that served multiple guests at a time before and truth be told I never have because I've been a little apprehensive. However to a family from China to visitors from Spain and Iran all the people I met during my stay were interesting and a pleasure to talk to which certainly added to my good experience.   "
6662231,154004990,2017-05-22,100480597,Stephen,The stay met our expectations however you are directly in the middle of the SF nightlife which means it can be quite noisy so bring some earplugs (Sunday night was therefore fairly quiet). You can walk to many of SF's attractions from here and to many Restaurants/Cafes.

L’appartement est parfait : propre et fonctionnel.
Grande cuisine avec tout le nécessaire de base ( café thé sucre)
Machine à laver le linge et sèche linge ...
Alice est très réactive si vous avez besoin de quoique ce soit.
Nous avons beaucoup utilisé l’application Lyft ( équivalent Uber )pour aller au centre ville et éviter de chercher des parkings hors de prix.
Application idéale pour se déplacer !
Bref appartement à recommander situé dans un quartier résidentiel très cosy et surtout totalement « sage »
Merci encore Alice 
Nous reviendrons avec plaisir "
8167459,488937542,2019-07-15,244783512,Andrea,I love this location and space. Easy walk to Lands End (hiking and views) Golden gate park and ocean beach.  Check in was a breeze and I was able to easily come and go as I needed to. Room is well set up clean and has a lot of extras included that made the stay feel like coming home.  Mattress was comfortable and it was so quiet at night. This location gave me easy access to everything in SF without the noise or congestion of the city. I highly recommend it!
24463,519503522,2019-08-28,80048685,Darin,Great location and Cathryn was a wonderful host. The place was exactly what is advertised and was very clean. The neighborhood was quiet and lots of cafes nearby.
19328446,348122381,2018-11-12,67506452,Kelli,THIS IS AN AMAZING PLACE!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Not only does this place FAR EXCEED EXPECTATIONS both Susan and her lovey DaVinci go above and beyond as “hosts with most” to ensure that we felt like we were indeed part of the family in a paradise atmosphere! I cannot wait to return to this SF Palace of positive vibes great energy and exquisite charm. I only wish I actually lived here! Bravo Bravo Bravo! THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH!!!
6117147,199365694,2017-10-01,27435180,Connor,"Overall really liked Diane's spot. 

The area isn't exploding with commercialism which coupled with the walking proximity to the beach AND Golden Gate Park was refreshing and fun. I live in a 750 sq foot apartment with my girlfriend and both of us thought the space was perfect for two. The back garden hang out area was also a really nice aspect of our stay. We were out and about doing things in the city all day & night so we weren't spending a ton of time at the apartment itself but it was great for a place to relax and reset. The bed was INCREDIBLY comfortable and the living room area is nice to hang out in read and maybe have some breakfast. It was also nice that Diane provided a binder of good spots in the area (bars restaurants etc.).

I don't have too many criticisms but staying on the bottom floor of a 2 story home with a family on the 2nd level brings its share of noise but if you're out and about all day it's not a big deal. Also if you're coming to SF for work and are dependent on a solid WIFI connection where you are staying this isn't your spot. The internet here was spotty but disconnecting on your vacation is a good thing!

I liked staying here a lot and would recommend it."
72444,224619462,2018-01-03,151828746,Ashleigh,Great place to stay that’s close to China town. Easy enough to walk most places!
1855096,10040047,2014-01-27,342709,Sebastian,"Mike was a wonderfully welcoming host and his flat was perfect. 

It's a great place spacious and bright with eclectic but beautiful decor. The kitchen is well stocked and there were lovely soft towels and toiletries in the bathroom. Everything was very clean. The bed was amazing with wonderful bedding - we slept so well despite the blue faced lady looking down on us!

The flat is in a very nice neighbourhood with a great coffee shop 2min walk down the hill. There is also a fun live music venue just around the corner and a few restaurants. For food shopping there is a well stocked organic shop just up the hill. Several buses and the Muni tram are available to get into different parts of town as well as the Caltrain to get further afield.

Mike is a perfect host always available to help while at the same time not at all intrusive. We really appreciated the time he spent to show us around and helping us to find good places to go. 

We would definitely try and stay with Mike next time we're in San Fran! "
11845487,429055268,2019-03-26,129500238,Dylan,This place is a great value for the locations and amenities.  If you are looking for somewhere you can go out to the city and sleep in this may not be it.  The walls are very thin and we could hear everything above us.  Children running talking on the phone...etc.
323635,227426699,2018-01-14,165841493,Giorgi,Great place.
20608059,426366623,2019-03-20,103121863,Jade,"The room was as per the photos very clean and check in was great. Carol even allowed us to leave our bags in the room and check out late the day of check out which was much appreciated and made our plans easier. 
The area itself is really nice quiet and feels very safe - a great place to come back to after sightseeing and exploring the city and always a cheap Uber ride back from any point (most we paid for 2 of us was 7 dollars).
A few things which sadly weren't so great though:
Unexpected noise from the host/s from above us.  We were woken up the first night around 5am by footsteps dog running/barking and general movement of what we assume was the host/s getting ready for work. We understand this is Carol's home and we're sharing the same building but didn't expect such early starts - nothing earplugs can't solve lucky we brought ours.
There's also a small window right next to the bed with a very thin blind therefore light from a streetlamp did shine though - bring an eyemask!
So those 2 factors together didn't make for a great environment to get a good nights sleep as even earplugs and eyemasks become uncomfortable after a while and as the neighbourhood was so quiet it was  a shame we had to use these to sleep through the night."
191632,245070107,2018-03-20,64577266,Phillip,"Better than the Ritz Carlton.  Why stay in a stuffy hotel when you can stay in this quiet awesome comfortable apartment. Maria is the best.  Fantastic communication  constant check-ins to make sure everything is perfect  and super accommodating and helpful.   Little touches made the place feel welcoming. 

The location is great. We spent a lot of time at the beautiful golden gate park which is only a couple of blocks away.  We biked across the bridge and the warf was only a short Uber ride away.  The museum passes where just the icing on the cake to a fabulous trip."

32361583,464918239,2019-06-06,258852491,Mary,Great clean sunny space in very nice quiet neighborhood - great location - minutes away from Golden Gate Bridge and the beach
13084734,102323864,2016-09-17,73689197,Anne,Where to start! Stranded on sidewalk at 11.00 pm for 30 minutes as no key code sent. No sink in closet kitchen no cooking facilities. Cups needed rinsed in bathroom sink.  Noise from upstairs where over 12 teenagers stomped about and played piano in early hours every morning. Steps everywhere in apartment causing trip hazard. Seems its all about the money for Peg.
9187534,218730947,2017-12-14,6065835,Matthew,This home is beautiful spacious and so incredibly convenient for all of our needs on our trip. I would definitely stay again. The hosts are fantastic and very thoughtful. We had everything we could need.
25434591,411229094,2019-02-11,233448130,Jill,The location was perfect.
958507,40073592,2015-07-28,9068455,Mark,John was a wonderful host and very accommodating. The home itself was large for the area very cozy and in a great location. Having the full kitchen and a spectacular outdoor courtyard were definite pluses! Thank you John!
14705126,354092676,2018-11-30,2602900,Calvin,"The apartment is better than i expected and with a thoughtful host like Anna it makes the whole stay better. The location is secluded but safe in a quiet spot near Golden Gate Park which i managed to grab a morning run.

The apartment is as per photo- simple quaint and homely. A lot of nice personal touches.  It has all amenities needed for a short stay.  Beds are comfy spacious comes with central heating and bathrooms amenities are well sufficient. 

Host gesture of providing a free bottle of wine and fresh towels was well appreciated due to the rainy weather in SF!

A terrific place to stay with young family. Highly recommended."
138772,334686841,2018-10-09,8627116,Cristina,Super nice studio way up high on top of Mission Dolores Park and Castro. Safe neighborhood and lots of opportunities to exercise your legs!
14538591,510934791,2019-08-16,162818711,Nallely,The apartment was great since has a private entrance you don't bother anybody arriving at any time! Location was great and there was plenty of parking on Lincoln Ave (we were doing a roadtrip and that was very convenient for us). We will definitely stay again at Pauline's her place is very comfy and thoughtful of people who travel with mini-fridge microwave and a mini kitchen! Thank you so much Pauline for the hospitality and great communication!
3506164,61223032,2016-02-01,17134363,Malcolm,Very good communication throughout the process. Easy access to a private garden area.  Immaculate environment. With a wonderful view of the English type garden from the large bedroom.  Soft comfortable bed and the towels were big and soft. We had a wonderful experience at Emerald Garden. Two thumbs up.   
4269254,358835167,2018-12-15,69079881,Wale,Staying at Marjorie's place was super cool she's so warm and helpful. she always replied as soon as posible when i had questions. the place is so cozy the bed is super confortable and we got more than we expected about her hospitality and her husband's. i definitely recommend this place :D
479072,142127734,2017-04-06,17866874,Emily,The apartment was great! Actually bigger than I expected. It worked perfectly for us with our 2 yr old. There's a curtain that can be closed to separate the bedroom from the office area we put our daughter in the office area and not being able to see us helped her fall asleep quicker. The hosts were very nice and easy to communicate with. The only downsides for us were: it's located on a very steep hill (which we knew before booking) which was challenging to navigate loading in and out of the car with our toddler. Also the garden in the back had so many mosquitoes and spiders we couldn't be out there. Not a big deal though as we spent most of our time out and about in the city. Lastly the bathroom is tiny and there's no surface area to set your things down which made getting ready a bit more time consuming (but I imagine most SF bathrooms are tiny;) Despite all that the apartment was great and the hosts were great! I would recommend!
59344,102382480,2016-09-18,2238822,Sophie,"We stayed at Johns studio for 4 nights and it was everything we expected it to be. It was a quiet and in a gorgeous location that was not touristy at all- yet was close enough to get to everywhere easily & quickly. The studio itself was perfect for 1 or 2 people it had everything we needed! 
John was very responsive & hospitable. We will certainly be returning! "

15434462,531977064,2019-09-18,3422155,Simon,"This is a good place to stay in a very expensive city. The host is very welcoming and flexible about check-in and check-out. The place is convenient to the train. The rooms are well furnished and comfortable. (The bathroom was nicer than I have at home!) The best feature is a beautiful courtyard located right outside your suite.

That said I think the description is a little confusing. You get a private suite of three interconnected rooms - two bedrooms and a bath.  Down the hall is another listing with their own rooms.  There's a kitchen/dining area that's reserved for you but the other guests must pass through it to get to the front door.  We were surprised by that but it didn't end up being a big deal.  

I'd still recommend this listing if you're aware of what you're getting."
4387067,257896111,2018-04-27,183745764,Christina,Great location!
21123508,360478927,2018-12-20,134767202,Christina,Laura's place is a perfect place to stay. Impeccably clean with a super comfortable bed. The space is spacious and bright. She was very accommodating and responded quickly. I highly recommend staying here!
5863674,50712235,2015-10-13,3571538,Takis,the experience at Gil's home was great! I live in the Bay Area so I had second thoughts about renting a place in the city but it was so worth it. the apartment is really cozy and the views are amazing.. in some ways the place is even better than the beautiful pics. more than that Gil was extremely hospitable.. going out of his way time and time again to make sure we were comfortable. would definitely stay there again and would recommend it highly
971116,327899568,2018-09-24,32523583,Erla,Michael and David sure know how to make you feel welcome and comfortable. The apartment is located in a lovely residential neighbourhood close to public transport and good restaurants. The room is cosy and the bed very comfortable. We higly recomend staying at Michaels house!
28920042,543463091,2019-10-07,42209550,Peter,This is a fabulous place to stay near the Golden Gate Park. It was very clean near a variety of restaurants great shower and easy check in and checkout. Kel was great with communicating with us. I hope I can stay there again when I return to San Francisco.

7845599,133322697,2017-02-21,3435991,Stephanie,This is a great spot to stay in SF for a long weekend week or however long you might be in town! The fridge was stocked with great essential stuff plus beer yogurt bagels english muffins and the list goes on. He even has several different pints of ice cream in the freezer! The kitchen has everything you need if you want to stay in and cook. The location is very central and close to great bars and restaurants. The street traffic noise can be loud at night but Merkley is honest about that in his listing and he has a jar of ear plugs next to the bed! Overall super place and we would totally stay there again. Thanks Merkley!
1725853,112184378,2016-11-04,18605978,Jim,A very solid choice. Alex was extremely helpful and always available. The location is good within walking distance to several restaurants coffee shops and at the same time a good location on a quiet street. The apartment is ground floor behind the garage and very quiet clean and simple. Great shower and kitchen good bed and a nice patio in the back. Overall a great value. 
15067182,210321054,2017-11-08,78749498,Josh,Service is great--the staff made themselves available for a late checkin and held our bags after we checked out. There's a shared kitchen with a microwave and fridge and toaster oven. Neighborhood is very quiet though not particularly near any of the sites. Rooms are huge compared to any comparable hotel room though the noise insulation between floors and through the outside door is a bit thin. Overall a very good experience.
2538807,78419320,2016-06-06,65650516,George,This is definitely a hidden gem in San Francisco. My g/f and I were having a devil of a time finding a place that was reasonable affordable and clean -- Phil's place is all of the above and then some. The area it's located in is excellent and provides easy driving or Muni access to the rest of the city. The local area around the residence is quaint and has all the amenities you need especially if you want to take a lazy day off from vacationing. I really truly can't speak highly enough of how Phil provided everything we need and made himself available but was still able to give us complete privacy during our stay. He is an excellent host! The room itself is simple and has plenty of coffee tea a microwave and a hot plate to do some light cooking on. The bed is comfortable and the accommodations are super clean and we felt right at home. I hope all my future Air BnB experiences are like this! 
2134475,131596998,2017-02-12,107852231,Stephanie,房间舒适有电热毯二楼餐厅提供早点面包､咖啡､茶;2只狗很乖;老夫妇很热情尤其是夫人帮我们很多｡过马路就是艺术宫金门大桥也很近附近有超市Marina买到各种食物｡需要爬楼梯卧室在三层｡唯一的问题是临街有车辆声音如果你晚上特别需要安静可能要考虑一下｡Nice house i just love it!

1421774,135859909,2017-03-06,19413784,Josephine,Extremely well located between great neighbourhoods yet still in a quiet neighbourhood. It's the perfect romantic studio with a little garden - would highly recommend! 
14804950,302589657,2018-08-05,12932237,Carissa,Angela’s studio is lovely. It’s in a more residential part of town so is definitely a respite - it’s absolutely silent at night you wouldn’t even know you’re in a big city. We loved the location and felt right at home. We also appreciated how flexible Angela was allowing us to leave our bags past check out on our last day. 
4387067,289197387,2018-07-11,18047728,Kasper,Absolutely great and modern room in a really nice neighborhood. I loved the private bathroom and local recommendations!

212783,108626165,2016-10-16,87519175,Scott,Josh was accommodating to check in needs and that was much appreciated.  Location was fantastic and the room was spacious.
31125401,523507849,2019-09-03,13868300,Corey,Very great spot. We were driving from San Diego and arrived very late but Dongmei made sure we felt comfortable and welcomed us at check-in. The room had much to choose from for breakfast options and everything was very clean. So glad we stayed here and would stay here again in a heartbeat.
3081324,548457896,2019-10-17,264920743,Derek,House was great for a family of 5.  Less than 5 minutes walk to BART which has you in the centre of SF within 15 minutes.  Glen Park has a great feel with a market and great restaurants.  Carrie's place is fully equipped for a comfortable stay.
269371,232862204,2018-02-06,4248907,Geraldine,Matthew is a kind and accommodating host. It was so easy to come and go from his beautiful and comfortable home. It’s a cozy quiet space for sleeping - and just a short walk to some of the most gorgeous views of the city as well as restaurants and bars.
4902855,81500069,2016-06-23,3789557,Kate,Tony was so helpful in giving us directions to good parking options before we arrived and the place was clean and great. I would go back again if I travel to SF.
593253,219138516,2017-12-16,71307963,Darren,Trevor’s place was very clean and cozy. The location is great as there were many good restaurants and cafes in walking distance and I could easily hop on the train and be downtown in only 10 minutes! Trevor responded to all my questions very quickly. I would stay here again.
10052512,95670708,2016-08-20,16696768,Olivier,"Our stay  was excellent. It was exactly as described 
The bed and the house was very comfortable for us.
We stayed three weeks and couldn't have felt more at home. Perhaps with more electronics than our house in France 
Even the neighbourhood is very nice
 We Loved  that many  restaurants and shops were near to the house.    With no doubt You will  enjoy your stay at Christopher's  home."
22340219,293620161,2018-07-20,24456919,Cynthia,I came to SF for my annual work retreat. As you know work retreats can be long days and I wish I spent more time than I did in Jenny's home. With that said after a long day it was very nice to come back to her home. It's cozy and warm and she adds delicate details to the home. Thanks for taking care of me Jenny (and Jerry). It was much appreciated. Oh and last but not least her dog Jerry is the cutest dog and also was a great host. I was actually a bit sad when I had to leave. I did not want to leave him!
12026856,231760531,2018-02-02,167339361,Yael,Maria has a beautiful house that is very comfortable to stay at! It’s easy to get to the center of town from her house by public transportation.
20695687,226634998,2018-01-11,52623321,Dave,Tyler's place was fantastic and my best Abnb experience to date. The room was outstanding- a huge amount of thought was given to providing every comfort. The standard was better than several 5 star hotels I've used. Tyler's apartment is gorgeous and the guys are wonderful company. I would recommend absolutely without reservation. 
8859249,213379868,2017-11-20,1387020,Jim,Great location and friendly hosts.

3759246,463175937,2019-06-02,166837590,Bryce,The space was lovely stylish and comfortable. The bed was extremely cozy and the room was quiet for our relaxing weekend. The kitchen area was a bonus for sure and you can't beat the price for the location! David was quick with communications and greeted us with hospitality and warmth. He shared some local tips for Cafe's and restaurants and gave us a run down of our room so we were sure to get the most out of the experience. We had a lovely time and would come back in a heartbeat! Thank you David!
23147212,572012064,2019-12-01,15743152,Truett,Excellent location and a really clean stylish place. She also provides a very comprehensive homemade guide to SF and the area. Exceeds the price in value for sure.
12437037,237132932,2018-02-21,75232346,Owen,Sandy provided us with a very clean spot in a fantastic area of San Francisco. Very close to Golden Gate Park and Haight St and close enough to  the Pier. Highly recommend staying at Cindy’s. Be aware of street parking on Tuesday’s we got a ticket.

14553693,135020188,2017-03-02,7589958,Filip,Great place. Quiet yet close to some really great shops and restaurants. Also close to N line which got me to Montgomery station everyday. Slept peacefully every night. 
3721927,28583602,2015-03-26,16781809,Geir,My host Kelly greeted me and made me feel welcome. She even provided me with espresso. Nice and quiet neighborhood. It was close to UCSF Parnassus which mattered to me. The room is fantastic with a nice separate bathroom including a shower and a bathtub. This room is as it is described by the host. 
342420,169520391,2017-07-12,57822399,Nicole,"Elizabeth was a wonderful host - very quick on the communication front.

The house was spectacular super unique and comfortable. Each room has a different charm and located such a special neighborhood."
648086,138417725,2017-03-19,6521052,Shirleen,We loved our stay with Ponge- we had the whole basement level to ourselves the bathroom was right beside the bedroom. Everything was clean and neat. Ponge was an amazing and friendly host. He provided clean towels bottled water and fruits when we arrived. Bus 24 conveniently takes you to Castro and Mission (about 15min bus ride) and from there you can take the muni to pretty much everywhere. Uber and Lyft are cheap and great options too. We took an uber to Ponge's for about $25 and it was about a 15-20minute drive. A nice safe neighbourhood with friendly people. Highly recommended! 
27857184,460628524,2019-05-29,256284019,Gerald,Great 2 bedroom. Super clean and great use of space.
15236335,434321697,2019-04-07,206500203,Alexa,Mai’s space really made our stay amazing! Very close to the muni bus stop which can take you all around the city. The place is covered in personal touches that kept us entertained the entire time. We had forgotten about the garden in the back and I am already missing waking up to it each morning!

12041223,565626755,2019-11-17,78605510,Michael,An affordable price a relatively close location to the Mission and public transit and the option to have two single beds make this a rare find! Nicole was very gracious.
749744,81437107,2016-06-23,59893113,Ana Paula,It´s a nice place to stay it was clean and homey the only inconvenient is it doesn´t have a parking lot and it´s difficult to find where to park in the area. 
3122882,40408151,2015-07-30,33263817,Ryan,A perfect experience. The flat was very nice and situated in a cook area of San Fran. Kara met us at an odd time and even helped us find a great pho restaurant! They have managed to blend the feeling of being at home with staying at a luxurious hotel. I loved being able to walk to most places and was helped by maps they provided. Overall a great experience.

23171836,299857976,2018-07-31,112764151,Julio Alejandro,"This place was extremely cozy! Very private but yet still full of fun. There are other rooms as well and everything is shared like bathrooms and kitchen area. 
Sze was always quick to respond for any of our questions. Great hosts! This place was awesome! "

499096,25016188,2015-01-05,15391030,Ahmad,"Ingrid is such an amazing host. She welcomed me by her own self when I arrived and explained everything. She even had some christmas stuff fruits and nuts ready for my arrival.

The studio is very clean cosy and the location of the neighbourhood is very nice. Quiet next to many good restaurants and Dolores Park."
63247,172175798,2017-07-20,134459307,Collin,It was a fantastic experience. To watch him carve and create jewelry the old fashioned way was incredible. He was extremely knowledgeable and very conversational!  Would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more!
6993593,106764066,2016-10-08,70006978,Edward,This was our first time using airbnb. John's hospitality was exceptional. A much more enjoyable experience than staying in a hotel and his flat is in the perfect location in San Francisco. He made us American style pancakes in the morning and even insisted on driving us with all our luggage to our daughters apartment on our last morning. Such a great start to a two week trip in California. Our only regret was having booking into hotels for the rest of our trip rather than using airbnb. 
10767861,66064817,2016-03-19,3845250,Nitin,"""My friend stayed for 1 month (long term) and his experience was outstanding. This is the first time he was visiting USA and stayed at an AirBnB. 
Vishal (the host cum friend) is a wonderful kind well mannered flexible and very supportive person. He provided nice amenities like a hotel. You will find him as like as he described himself. On his first day Vishal showed him the around in SF provided all the informations about SF and went out for lunch. His home is stocked with breakfast/fruits/juices for you all the time provided soaps and shampoos towels put a TV and mirror in guest room after my friend arrived. He had a very comfortable stay there and everything was perfect.
His house is so bright full of lights tidy super clean & huge private bed room and situated at the center of the city. All the places are easily commutable from his house. MAHI (his dog) is very obedient always welcomes when you enter and controlled.
Will not hesitate to stay again..!!""

13884730,133779820,2017-02-24,87315724,Emily,Great deal for the location! You're central to Chinatown Union Square and Nob Hill. We walked to a majority of places. The room is in an older hotel which has been very nicely updated; very clean. Good security and informed personnel to be of any assistance. This place was perfect for our trip!
12026845,331819254,2018-10-03,27663872,Blythe,I had a lovely stay in Maria's garden room. The room was neat and tidy and made for a perfect minimalist stay and comfortable place to lay my head after exploring the city all day. Maria's house has TONS of plants (which always makes me feel at home) and was impeccably decorated.
8195144,101503815,2016-09-13,1807560,Beverly,Elena was a great host. The studio was fabulously clean and organized for guests. She took care of our needs quickly. There is not a market or restaurant nearby so bring the essential goods you need. The neighborhood near the SF Botanical Gardens was full of tasty restaurants and within a 30 min walk. Very comfortable. 
13148133,166518381,2017-07-03,127896540,Quenton,This was one of the best parts of our two week trip! Walead's home is in a perfect location for anyone looking to explore San Francisco. Walead was very knowledgeable and had excellent recommendations for food transportation and entertainment. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wishes to enjoy a stay in the bay area!
878935,14080255,2014-06-11,13935492,Imran,What a fantastic trip! Ashley was a great host and her place was perfect! The location is awesome with restaurants and markets all around. Being only a few blocks from GG Park allowed my wife to get in some good morning runs while the rest of us slept in in the comfy beds! I was worries about parking but found that to be super easy with street parking throughout the neighborhoods. Ashley provided us a great welcome breakfast which we enjoyed in her back garden. Everything we needed was available making this trip super memorable for us. I would highly recommend this place to anyone thinking of traveling to SF!
5998790,505792699,2019-08-09,202178076,Adva,Great room very homey comfortable with clean bedroom and bathroom and extremely nice people
1456153,14428677,2014-06-19,13592514,Anna,"This house was really amazing i have never seen anything like it before! Our one week stay was wonderful and with a fully equipted kitchen we could eat in Whenever we wanted to! The neighbourhood was peacefull and it was easy to go everywhere in the city of San Francisco! Before we arrived during the stay and after we'd left i had a really good communication with Wendy she answered all of our questions! When Fred met us to show the house he showed everything we needed to know about it!  
I Will definitly come back!"
1931763,152298447,2017-05-15,112949045,Giovanna,Excellente  ubicacion. Tanto para el dia como para la noche. Alquilamos solo el cuarto. Matthew estuvo disponible para consulate y nos dio privacidad poniendo un biombo en el pasillo.
8735636,81412569,2016-06-22,54448641,Robert,This was a beautiful apartment in an excellent location. The apartment is spacious tastefully furnished and comfortable. There are excellent restaurants in close proximity and some great shops and boutiques in nearby Polk St. Staying here really enhanced our San Francisco experience. 
1344752,14289727,2014-06-16,13466244,Jonathan,"Patti was informative and accommodating from the moment we inquired about her property.

When we arrived everything was as described and we had a very pleasant stay as a result. Modern and well-equipped kitchen ample closet space for our 2 night stay; very clean fresh linens and towels.

The neighborhood was different than we expected but overall quiet residential and a short walk to most essentials."
4321720,78851265,2016-06-09,57668159,Emma,Great stay with Michael and Novita. Extremely easy getting into the house and the room provided everything we needed! Perfect safe location with easy access to the city especially if you use the MUNI bus system! 
148627,23093355,2014-11-23,88301,Eric,Taking this apartment was a great move. I was within easy walking distance from Fort Mason where I attended a conference. Getting to and into the apartment was easy as Mark had left perfect directions. Pictures are accurate. The garage and garden was a nice extra. Super quiet! Internet was fast and reliable. The place was spotless and I was not missing a thing it was all there. This was quite an inspiration for my own apartments and I was pleasantly surprised Mark knows what he is doing recommended!
14225205,154647863,2017-05-25,69322014,Olga,El apartamento es muy lindo limpio los muebles son recientes la cocina tiene de todo incluso Michelle nos dejo unos chips para comer. Ella nos hizo la vida fácil con horarios flexibles para el check in y el check out responde rápidamente los mensajes un super host. Hay buses muy cerca y esta a tres calles de market street es muy facil moverse para visitar San Francisco. Super recomendado!
4439461,227897218,2018-01-16,167575303,Blaine,If you like art and a great secluded place to stay in the heart of down town then this is your spot! Great amenities and a store for personal items literally across the street. Jeff was very nice and very responsive! I would definitely come back! ***** Five stars!
16331804,311232318,2018-08-20,19620850,Mehul,"Kevin was a great host with a very quick response time. When there was no bottle opener in the unit Kevin brought a replacement the next day.

The parking situation is a bit difficult. It was hard to find a space nearby though the street parking is free.

The kitchen area was nice and clean but there is no microwave or toaster (yet.)

At this price I'd stay here again."

1932019,62773452,2016-02-16,5301271,Julia,Martha had a beautiful place. It was on a quiet street and very close to everything. She waited for me to arrive and gave me her parking spot which was very nice of her. I would happily stay at this home again. Thanks for everything !
30469161,504437639,2019-08-07,119002012,Sarah,Janelle was very friendly and responded quickly to our questions. The room was clean and exactly like the pictures.

18397875,234181378,2018-02-11,3675079,Adriana,We spent three nights here and it is a beautiful space. The unit was great for families without sacrificing on design. I traveled with my mom husband and one-year-old and there was plenty of room for all of us. We loved walking to the beach and little shops in the surrounding area. Anjna and Rob were responsive and friendly and the unit provides ample privacy.
14673134,156691544,2017-05-31,4079358,Katie,I cannot praise Jeff's studio highly enough; it was wonderful. It was immaculately clean and had a full kitchen so self catering was possible. They provided towels and shampoo and a hairdryer.  The studio is located a short walk to bars restaurants and supermarkets and although it's on a busy road it is at the back of the building so is very quiet. Jeff and Nelly were very attentive hosts and Jeff even cleaned the bbq so we could use it. I would very happily stay here again.  
3030653,71082067,2016-04-23,28712285,Elmar,"Just a perfect place for exploring San Francisco. The studio was situated in the mission district near the BART station and was surrounded by a lot of good restaurants.
Some steps away from the main road so it was very quiet at night.
The studio just got everything we wished for. A very comfortable bed fully equiped kitchen and a neat bathroom. 
Lindsay Thank you so much for letting us stay at your place."
10835637,465438199,2019-06-07,149293993,Anna,The location was wonderful we just had a tad issue with the fact that we couldn’t lock the door although we came across no issues with the safety of our personal belongings. Overall a fine place in a good district to spend a night or so!
4607177,112183655,2016-11-04,6949289,Treh,Lindsay was an incredible host. She answered all my questions promptly. The space is beautiful and very clean. Located in an awesome neighborhood close to many shops and restaurants. We will definitely visit again.  
1556680,37446133,2015-07-07,1407695,"Gavin, Candice & Cailin",We so enjoyed our stay in this lovely little apartment.   The location is wonderful - just a short walk into Golden Gate close to Chain of Lakes and the Bison paddock.   Great base for trips to all the sights of SF.   Everything was clean and comfortable and all the necessities were provided.  The little patio and hammocks were a nice way to get some fresh air.   We would definitely stay here again when visiting SF. 
727866,133149067,2017-02-20,9101821,Katie,"Kevin and Esther try to make your stay at their garage room comfortable. I wouldn't call in a studio however. It's more like a room with private bathroom and a kitchenette. There's  a weird way to enter the room. You have to go though their garage so I think it could be a very good place to hide if police is chasing you (joke). 
They had coffee fruit clean sheets and towels. The place was clean and the heater worked and we didn't suffer from being cold (what's up with California and their love of cold homes?).
It was ok for an overnight stay. The place is extensively overpriced. I don't think we'll stay there again. "
2263794,332203984,2018-10-04,93788097,Jiinxie,如果你想要有宾至如归的感觉我非常推荐选择Albert的家｡由于飞机延误最后夜里12点才抵达入住Albert一直等我们到了之后才休息｡房屋内的设施是很有科技感的为生活提供很多便利每天早晨可以自助早餐这点很方便｡Albert和Tiffany为我们推荐了很好吃的墨西哥风味餐厅及泰国风味餐厅实惠又美味｡洗衣机和烘干机都是很好用的｡停车很方便总能在附近找到停车位所以想要租车完全不用担心停车问题｡还有Albert的中文说的很好让初到旧金山的我们感到很亲切｡总之体验完美甚至让我喜欢上旧金山超赞房东超赞的房子谢谢你们热情的接待:)
4558898,516718814,2019-08-24,99868380,Wenjuan,It’s a shared room but Jane makes it feel like home. Jane is also very hospitable and provide facilitation and private space as much as you want. Will be back again.

4075971,91516648,2016-08-05,53256785,Gareth,Bobbie's home is perfect for a family vacation in San Francisco.  We stayed in 4 AIrBnBs during our California trip and Bobbie's was the most elegant and comfortable.  It's a 10 minute walk to the BART so no need to drive in the city.  We enjoyed the neighborhood restaurants which were very different and less expensive than central San Francisco.  Thank Bobbie for an excellent stay/
9435665,64322226,2016-03-02,15106272,Erin,The listing was incredibly accurate and Maria was super accommodating and easy to communicate with. Though I didn't get to spend much time in the space because I was there for business it was clean and bright just like described. 
1665516,132561797,2017-02-18,34475915,Paul,This is a cozy well equipped unit.  We stayed 6 nights and we were very comfortable.  We would stay again.
992913,22262363,2014-11-02,21775166,Mollie,"I was greeted by Irina's roommate Greg who was extremely welcoming. He made the bed with fresh sheets and provided towels and keys to the apartment. 

The location here is amazing right next to Coit Tower for all of you tourists out there. Amazing view of the entire city and bay. I would recommend this location without hesitation and hope I will be welcomed back to my favorite city! 

Thanks Irina and Greg!"

128230,21576666,2014-10-20,266297,Stephen,Maria's Castro Sanctuary is just that; a little slice of quiet and peaceful heaven just steps away from the fun and excitement of the Castro.  This was the perfect place to stay during a busy conference week; it's a clean bright and spacious one bedroom nicely decorated and only a few minutes walk to the MUNI stop to get downtown.  Good restaurants a grocery store and plenty of coffee shops are only a block or two away.  Bed and sofa are super comfy.  Maria was a great host offering nice welcoming touches and very easy to communicate with before and during my visit.  Would love to come back anytime!
23711998,469534758,2019-06-14,49641858,Richard,Helen’s place is outstanding.  She’s very responsive and has everything labelled and set up perfectly to receive guests. The actual room and amenities were top notch.  You really should not pass up her place if you have the option and will certainly look to stay with her again when I’m in SF! 5 stars!
33667375,541099176,2019-10-04,24527418,Youning,Loved my stay here. Would definitely come back if I visit again.
9063798,295957669,2018-07-24,62880026,Pilar,Alojamiento fantástico la habitación espaciosa y la cama muy muy cómoda hemos dormido como en casa! Hemos podido aparcar el coche en la misma casa y utilizar la cocina y comedor. Carl nos ha dado muy buenos consejos y nos ha ayudado a planificar nuestro viaje después de San Francisco ya que se cancelaron los planes que teníamos. Estamos muy agradecidos y repetiríamos sin dudarlo!
4510968,492918846,2019-07-21,256865910,Gilber,I recommend this spot !

23860519,571982525,2019-12-01,52400155,Suzanne,This is a great apartment that is sparkling clean with plenty of privacy and great views of the ocean.
1985338,447448682,2019-05-03,9330869,Dana,If you are looking for what the Airbnb experience should be in one of San Francisco's few almost-rural environments book this place. The hosts put time into making it thoughtfully perfect. North light meaning no bright sun yet plenty of light deck outside with idyllic lemon tree storage worked out artful appointments masterminded by a couple in the design field. This was my first Airbnb rental where I can't wait to come back.

351881,5296280,2013-06-23,6480762,Caroline, I recently had the opportunity to stay with Katie and Chris at their home and it was an all-around delightful experience!  Katie and Chris were gracious and knowledgeable hosts.  They were excellent at advising us about public transportation opportunities nearby.  Their home was lovely and spacious.  The views from their apartment were wonderful as well. 
2160504,83101385,2016-07-01,77822729,Zhang,I was very happy to stay here I felt I was at home. The bed is soft and clean Mr. Will prepared everything you need such as shampoo body wash towel. When I arrived late he prepared snacks and water so warm! I think staying here is better than staying at hotel.  Thank you and Carols!
6543813,45288013,2015-09-01,1115107,Derek,Leonard was a first-rate host: warm generous and welcoming great conversation immaculately clean and pleasant household comfortable bed a nice list of suggestions for restaurants good location just blocks from Castro Theater.

15005046,198857529,2017-09-30,4918490,Janelle,Great space and can tell it's been newly renovated. Fit 4 adults well. Beautiful neighbourhood and convenient location. You can definitely hear noise from upstairs but that is to be expected from a basement suite. Would recommend to others!
14426130,540064604,2019-10-02,91531522,Chloe,I had such a nice stay at david’s place for my short stay in sf. The space is so beautiful clean and thoughtfully designed. checking in and out was so easy I’ll definitely be back:)

1992217,548459231,2019-10-17,183384288,Alex,We had a very nice stay at Peters home. He was very friendly and welcoming. Peter offered a lot of privacy we barely saw each other during our stay. Our room was very clean and so was the in-suite bathroom. For breakfast there was fresh coffee made and we could choose from a lot of different things.

23018782,313663424,2018-08-25,40503131,Oscar,This house is amazing has nice amenities and works for the two people we where on this trip. Was close to bus stops so it was easy to reach financial district in the mornings and back in the afternoons. Sarah left good suggestions for nearby restaurants which where within a few blocks of the house. 
21220773,295979439,2018-07-24,5213003,Christen,"Upsides: A unique building that seemed to be in a safe area with the great added bonus that we could park our car behind a gate for the night. That was awesome! Cato was also kind and let us check in late. 
Downsides: very far from downtown not clean and lots of noise that kept us up for awhile. "
1356129,270269179,2018-05-28,39563179,Miranda,We had a wonderful stay at Noah’s. Everything was organized and clean when we got there. We would highly recommend and stay there again!
6074750,214377153,2017-11-25,6376268,Alexander,Very nice and clean place close to Chinatown in a safe and beautiful neighborhood. You have the lower area for yourself so it is almost like having your own little place. Communication has been great and everything was as expected. We would definitely come again.
4663060,24088930,2014-12-19,7452263,Lydia,"This private space with separate entrance is super clean cozy and comfortable. Good bed clean bathroom with everything you could need lovely view from big picture window and plenty of space. This is the perfect alternative to a hotel. 
Only met our host once but he was friendly and kind. So easy to communicate with and available if we needed anything. 
My boyfriend and I stayed two nights but if we had more time would have definitely stayed longer!"

8886022,152000486,2017-05-14,5088956,Paul,Great location and value for money. Matthew was responsive and courteous as a host and place was clean with all needed amenities for a comfortable stay. Only issue was a different from expected place at the same location (apparently an upgrade to a larger place upon checking though I had my hopes set on the location as advertised).  
14538591,476670359,2019-06-26,170146265,Elisabeth,Die Unterkunft bei Pauline war genau richtig für unseren kurzen Aufenthalt in San Francisco. Die Kommunikation mit Pauline war super und es war kein Problem unsere kleine Tochter mit zubringen. Das Studio war blitzsauber und wir hatten alles was wir brauchen. Sie hat uns auch geholfen ein Taxi zu rufen. Wir kommen immer wieder gerne zu Pauline.
3759368,121518258,2016-12-17,4944736,Tripti,Leo and Dan's spot was great - I timed it a 5-7 minute walk from the MUNI which was great for my conference. The space itself was beautiful and clean with a lavender bush in the yard right outside the sliding glass doors. I really appreciated their courtesy and willingness to accommodate my needs - I'd highly recommend this spot to anyone. Also it's never a bad thing to be steps from the Castro Theater - one of my favorite spots for watching old movies in the Bay Area. 
1815551,152686432,2017-05-17,68759656,Lindsay,Easy communication and check-in!  Great location!

10990428,111778304,2016-11-01,2658524,Jiri,Jia has saved our trip to San Francisco. She respond in the speed of light to our request for staying at her place. This place is in the perfect location surrounded by great restaurants and cafes. The private bathroom is just next to the room. We felt comfortable in the room but the walls are like paper and you hear the noise. But the whole house is absolutely beautiful. 
14451638,166841654,2017-07-04,130986994,En-Shuo,If you live in the room near the door it might be noisy as you'll hear people arrive and leave. Furthermore you might also hear the host washing towers and all other stuff as the washing machine locates in front of the room door.
616204,79870562,2016-06-14,32314568,Goslik,"Jenny was very accommodating and the unit was neat and clean. What it lacks in natural lighting it makes up in location. It's very close to most things and if you don't mind a walk over a hill or two you can walk everywhere. Jenny was always available by text and apart from the wireless being temperamental the unit was what we wanted.
Thanks Jenny for a great stay

21679018,269045257,2018-05-26,11889091,Akash,I was happy to find the apartment to be beyond my expectations. It was very spacious clean and we'll equipped. The connection by bus just a few steps away was very convenient. The hosts were very helpful and eager to take care of every concern. I did not find any much bothersome sound disturbance as was mentioned on the net. I would ensure my friends and family stay there next time.
24065926,536979286,2019-09-27,15824390,Jessica,Great location in SF with tons to do nearby. The spot is essentially a hotel and was perfect for a couple nights in the city.
22208187,349218674,2018-11-16,33274619,Jon,Really enjoyed staying at Michael's place. The location is great and close to all kinds of great restaurants and things to do. Even though it's a timeshare versus a normal 'house' Airbnb it was still very easy to book and coordinate and was the perfect spot to stay while in SF.
728585,79381055,2016-06-12,225776,Tamara,Doug was super warm and welcoming to my in-laws. He came out and chatted with everyone when they arrived. The place is lovely - right in the center of Noe. It's near all the restaurants and cafes that you need. The room itself is really pretty and tastefully decorated. It is right off the garden and has a separate entrance. My In-laws said the place was super clean and comfortable. Doug even went out of his way to leave a little milk in the fridge when requested. I would definitely recommend this place.

1229606,11416941,2014-04-01,6672099,Agatha,"I loved John & Sue's place!  They have been very accomodating to our stay (even at the last min request). Although I was little worried about the unit being at a basement i didnt feel like suffocating and it did not have any basement-like feel to it.

The location was central and was within 10min of driving to every where.  We especially enjoyed the beers that John and Sue left for us!  

Thank you for being great hosts!

Because we rent the whole apartment we didn't see Amadid and Martha. But Amadis give us very detailed information and answered our questions very detailed.  If we traveled in San Francisco again I will still consider their house.
109883,537482118,2019-09-28,37607385,Nick,Absolutely one of the best places I’ve stayed. Beautiful view great location and outstanding hosts. I almost don’t want to recommend this spot because I don’t want them to fill up! I want to come back!

4463165,37245612,2015-07-05,16582421,Jonathan,"My wife and I arrived from SFO at midnight as planned.  Finding parking on the street nearby was easy.  We made our way in and found our bedroom easily as instructed.  The house is extremely quiet and we had a much needed restful sleep on the every comfortable bed.  The next morning we needed to leave by 8:30 so our stay was very short but fit our needs perfectly.  Coffee at Philz and pastries at Noe Valley Bakery both within a few blocks made for a nice bonus to our morning.  Thanks Valerie!

29221865,465994892,2019-06-08,13222060,Nanda,"Room is cozy and bathroom was close and always available.
Other facilities were great value for money and the location is great for a walk on the beach. It was a very relaxing stat!

Instructions were clear and I had a seamless experience while checking in and out not seeing a single person. Despite feeling reserved I could communicate whenever I needed through the app.

Joey went above and beyond when I needed to recover an information I forgot at the room. I highly recommend and will definitely stay there again when going to SF.

Thanks Joey!"

My mom was very nervous as she had never stayed in an Airbnb before but after the first night was Vermont with praise on how kind and thoughtful Beth is how welcome she felt and how warm the home is.

I would highly recommend and next time my Moms in town again we will be booking her another stay."
585326,350258059,2018-11-18,12773624,Kendrick,Fairly spacious private 1-bedroom unit in a house.  Private entrance is very convenient.  Room was spotless and comfortable.  Plenty of space for 2 people.  The unit itself is fairly modern and updated.  Easy check in and out process.  Plenty of nearby street parking - but may have to park 1-2 blocks away depending on time/day.  Would definitely book again.
19416507,243651491,2018-03-16,135759517,Edwin,Cindy and Michelle were great hosts. The private room was very comfortable and clean. Located in a quiet neighborhood close the MUNI bus/streetcar service. Golden Gate is near by which is an awesome great park to check out. I would definitely stay here again if I visit San Francisco. Greatly recommend!
271647,79289048,2016-06-12,72595793,Jack,"I can't believe this place got as good of reviews as it did.  There is one word to describe it ""hostel"". For over $120/night to have filthy carpets and 6 ppl sharing one bathroom was a joke.  He didn't even greet us and I was traveling with my 12 year old daughter and found the room very below average for the price.  This is my second Airbnb experience and might be my last.  The neighborhood was cool but the accommodations were not worth $20/night much less $120.  This place needs some real upgrades "
259622,32714973,2015-05-20,24660314,Yu-Cheng,They created a really friendly environment for guests and the spot is easy to get anywhere in SF. Had a really good experience here. 
32712890,540028917,2019-10-02,68879924,Catherine,Shaun's place is really great value for money. It's really easy to get to downtown SF with a 5 min walk to the L tram taking you right into the heart of the city within 20 mins. Bedrooms and bathrooms were large modern and really clean with lots of toiletries provided. Great looking kitchen too but we didn't use it. Access via the keypad key locks was super straightforward making check in and out really simple. I'd definitely stay again :)

16043093,240442021,2018-03-04,2617429,Jasmine,Stacy's place was immaculate and you can tell she's a very thoughtful host. This place is ideal for single women travelers (I felt so safe here!) and people in general. This place doesn't have any stairs so it's also a great option for older travelers.

Gregg was hospitable and friendly while Jake was shy and mostly kept to himself. This was our first AirBnB and it was an excellent choice. 
21730409,287881551,2018-07-08,102692830,Martina,Alex byl velmi pohostinný a milý. I když jsme přijeli dřív nebyl s ničím problém. V domě jsou 3 koupelny a dvě kuchyně takže nebyl problém aby se všichni hosté vešli. Do centra vede přímý autobus. Určitě dopolučuji Alexe jako hostitele.

When I arrived Vera's husband met me and walked me through the lofted one bedroom 2 bath apartment. (It's immaculately decorated I want to live there permanently) Vera & her husband left me local beers fruits & chocolates sparkling water and a bottle of wine for my stay. The night before I left they left me a present outside my door with a mini bottle of campaign and chocolates! Amazing."

2026910,172096486,2017-07-19,28975461,Angèla,Het huis van Bree is geweldig. Fijne atmosfeer. Mooi ingericht met oog voor detail erg schoon vooral heel stil 's nachts maar wel in de buurt van winkels restaurants en natuurlijk het Golden Gate park. De keuken is goed uitgerust en nodigt uit om zelf te koken. Bree is een geweldige gastvrouw die haar gasten graag thuis willen laten voelen. Onze vragen werden meteen beantwoord. Kortom een heerlijke plek  midden in San Francisco.

23240184,476695302,2019-06-26,139702100,Laura,Rachel’s place is like a mini hotel suite. Private bathroom and closet directly off your room. Sparkling clean and everything is brand new. Fridge toaster coffee maker for all your breakfast needs. There’s also a cute terrace in the back to sit out if the weather is nice. Our only issue was parking. If you arrive after work hours don’t expect the get a space. We drove around for an hour and managed to find something but we were very lucky. I would recommend arranging parking for the first night of your stay and moving the car over the next day. Other than that we had an amazing stay.
845501,51539272,2015-10-21,28341301,Maik,Das Zimmer bei Delores ist jedem zu empfehlen der gerne einige Nächte etwas außerhalb von San Francisco (mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln etwas mehr als eine Stunde bis zum Fisherman's Wharf) in einer ruhigen Nachbarschaft verbringen möchte und trotzdem einfach nach San Francisco kommen möchte. In Delores Wohnung befinden sich noch zwei weitere Zimmer sodass man sich das Badezimmer im Regelfall mit 4 weiteren Personen teilt was für uns jedoch kein Problem gewesen ist. Parkplätze waren auch direkt vor der Wohnung in ausreichender Anzahl kostenlos vorhanden (großer Pluspunkt).
18582383,204777800,2017-10-19,137520422,Ernesto,Inmejorable ubicación aunque muy ruidosa la calle. Era de esperarse en Castro.
25058782,468555469,2019-06-12,57955359,Diana,The place is sparkling clean and the host was very responsive! It was an unusual hot weather but the host tried her best to find electric fans unfortunately the stores ran out of them. The location was very accessible to where we wanted to be. This place is ideal for people on a budget but still get a five star place.
2189514,126674823,2017-01-13,85485936,Scott,Close to parks to run and exercise close to great restaurants and shops.  Perfect location to live by yourself or with family. Loved the place.

1520938,98523540,2016-08-31,11733628,Johann,"Very nice apartment as pictured clean with plenty of space for my party of four. The location in a residential area is nice safe and with perfect public transport connection into the city and to the ocean/golden gate park. Two busstops are just around the corner. Groceries and nice restaurants/cafes are in short walking distance. 
We did not meet Jonathan and Jeannette in person but they were very respondent and attentive via email and they have provided everything we needed in the apartment - even a visitor's parking permit. The beds were comfortable Wifi worked very well."

4632133,51135588,2015-10-18,22527250,Christine,The Pacific Heights Hotel is right in the heart of downtown San Fran. We were a quick walk to Lombard Street and about a 15 minute walk to China town / the wharf. Our room was very clean parking was convenient and free breakfast of (very good) muffins and coffee each morning was a nice surprise. The room did get a little loud at night but that's because we kept our window open for air. There was a fan in the closet should we have chosen to close the window and use it. The shower was clean and had good water pressure/a nice shower head. Our car was safe in the parking lot and Young let us keep our car parked for a few hours after we had checked out. For a quick trip on the cheap this is a solid place to stay. 
971116,22860304,2014-11-16,23360301,Daniel,"Never enough words to describe the quaint perfect private hospitable environment that my girlfriend and I stayed in for 4 days and 3 nights. Woke up early at 6am coffee was a breeze with the keurig and nespresso machine in the kitchen. I walked into the kitchen with my pajamas on and did not see Michael or David until we left at 8am so explore the city and surrounding areas. Very private enviornment in which j was hesitant to stay but realized it was just an extra fancy apartment of ""our own"". Loved the hospitality that was given and the knowledge of the area written on post cards for areas of interest to see in wine country. The bathrooms were a breeze to use without the awkwardness of seeing a ""stranger"" in your place of stay even though it is their house. Everything was to be described perfectly even the distance to the trolleys busses and downtown area. I and my girlfriend absolutely love the area as well as the perfect size bedroom in which we hospitted for a few days. Everything about our stay was expected and a little more I might add. It was perfect and I want to buy Michaels place! Excellent location and styling! I don't know how much more beautiful it can get with the new renditions but I am excited to hear about it. Thank you so very much for your kindness and helpfulness in the place we know nothing about. Thank you!"
22715454,331470878,2018-10-02,205239103,SangChun,It’s really a nice and beautiful house. I would definitely recommend it!
2123469,334364014,2018-10-08,26875826,Cheryl,Viviane and Lele's house is beautiful! They were so welcoming and helpful for the entire time I stayed with them. And Milo was always ready for some loving. I'll be sure to keep them in mind next time I'm in SF.
16897188,199731954,2017-10-02,71013426,Jean,Lisa is such a great host. She has thought of every little detail. Her place is private yet right in the middle of the city. Close to everything...dining hiking nightlife and quaint local restaurants. I love her recommendations for dining and sight seeing.  It made for an amazing  vacation get away. Thank you so much Lisa
14323059,173730544,2017-07-23,206492,John,"A perfect place for anyone looking for a quiet place to hang their hat while checking out some of the finest restaurants in SF!

I stayed at JP's while starting a new job and apartment hunting; this was a hectic time and JP's place was perfect for me during that time. Quiet and cozy with a nice flat screen smart TV (Roku) and comfy couch so I could watch baseball and movies during much needed down times. 

Great restaurants nearby including Nopa which is wonderful! Also Little Star (deep dish) and Brenda's (southern). A bit further afield but still walkable is Nopalito and The upscale grocery Faletti Foods. 

Decent café nearby for your morning caffeine fix. 

The unit is on the ground floor so not a lot of light but the shared garden is quite nice!"
6505426,456536389,2019-05-21,107667433,Anyi,房间干净 也很不错 是个阁楼 四个人住差不多 周边环境很好 和其他地方相比来说比较安全
8763529,137477159,2017-03-15,119628769,Tomasz,"Great atmosphere at this conveniently located BnB. Come for more than a place to sleep the friendly club like environment lived up and beyond the hosts' reputations.
Great vibes from host and goest alike!
I highly recommend checking out DandyHorse Bicycle rental right around the corner for a friendly and complete bicycle rental experience. I thought it was one of the best ways to see what the city has to offer."
6092049,78413645,2016-06-06,21806742,Cynthia,Dan thought of everything we could possibly want. He has created a very welcoming experience with lovely and artistic space completely quiet and private and squeaky clean. Perfection!
3946571,19626224,2014-09-15,440393,Hao,It is a memorable experience staying with Lisa and her lovely dog for this weekend. The room is super clean and the house is antique and well maintained. And the place is in a vibrant neighborhood where you can very good restaurant and boutique store! Also it is close to the subway and easy to commute. Or you prefer Uber like me it is about 15 min from there to Lombard street with around 12 dollars. 
22800066,343502096,2018-10-31,18247166,Scott,The perfect place in a fantastic Castro location with a wonderful host. Looking forward to staying again.
30851994,482641461,2019-07-06,182936273,Justin,Terri’s place is by far our favorite Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Her place is a total gem. Quiet streets but close to everything. The views are unbelievable. If you’re staying in the city you should stay here no questions asked!
8763407,419372895,2019-03-03,15233412,Anthony,10 years staying in hostels all over and this is one of the best I've ever stayed in. Zain and Duncan are great guys too.
3664693,21030689,2014-10-10,19318274,Karen,Lovely bolt-hole in the centre of the city and better than expected from the pictures so a very pleasant surprise. Everything was clearly explained (wifi etc.) and the juice milk and other bits in the fridge very welcoming. Also the hot water bottle was a godsend which I needed after 2 days of long haul travel!

4252808,242887414,2018-03-13,148822891,A G,Heather’s place was very quaint and comfortable. We loved the bed and enjoyed the privacy is offered. Also the wine and chocolates were amazing. Heather is very accessible and nice!

348714,43488058,2015-08-20,15371825,Alexandra,Petit studio très chaleureux que nous étions contents de retrouver le soir après nos folles journées franciscaines ! Il est très bien situé près du Golden Gate Park et à 20 m de l'arrêt du bus qui nous emmène au centre ville. Georges est très serviable et nous le remercions de sa disponibilité.
2771688,75492664,2016-05-21,67760063,Paola,I booked MD's place on behalf of a visiting colleague. MD was extremely responsive and very easy to communicate with. She made sure to stay in contact with me before and after my colleague's arrival. Prior to the check-in date MD sent a helpful guide which highlighted transportation neighborhood and dining information within the area. My colleague mentioned that this helped him immensely. Even though I didn't personally stay at her place I would give her five stars for being such a wonderful and welcoming host. 
7182761,293143617,2018-07-19,502873,Connor,Brendan is a fantastic host. He’s got a clean and lovely space in a great location one that I’d definitely recommend to others. 
8717641,504473997,2019-08-07,219383065,Antoine,I booked the appartment for my parents and they were absolutely delighted by their stay there. It's ideally located just next to Golden Gate Park. It's also very well equiped and ideal for a long stay in San Francisco. The owners are very kind and gave them a lot of useful information.
1520929,420468912,2019-03-06,47895011,Stanislav,Annekarin’s apartment was great. Perfect location in Portrero Hill area. Apartment was very clean and spacious. Would definitely return here in future.

The studio was the perfect size for my two friends & I. The neighborhood is awesome & quite central. The best burritos & tacos were right near by! We all had a wonderful and enjoyable stay at Dan's place in the Mission.
342420,274297139,2018-06-08,13711679,Bryan,Elizabeth’s place could not have been more perfect for a work trip. It’s incredibly conveniently located and had a ton of nice touches that truly made our visit something special: there’s no shortage of board game/entertainment options and they have an amazing kitchen which meant we didn’t simply eat take-out every night (which would’ve been easy being in the Mission). They provided incredibly detailed instructions on how to take full advantage at the house and we especially loved being able to listen to music throughout the house. Elizabeth was kind and communicative and really made us feel welcome. We definitely hope to stay at Elizabeth’s again on a future work trip. Thanks again for everything!
1959880,65982125,2016-03-18,4472863,Former Member,"The stay was wonderful at Kristina's home. She made my stay very comfortable and I felt like at home. She was always available to help me and we got the chance to spend some great time together. 
The room is nice with everything you need and with its unique own bathroom. They have a charming little patio from where you can enjoy a nice view of the bay  take your breakfast or have a break.
I would highly recommend her room to the airbnb community! 
Thanks again Kristina for everything! I am very grateful."

8472927,77469529,2016-06-01,57454987,Marguerite,The neighborhood was beautiful and Lilya and Alexander were wonderful hosts! They left left wine bottled water and breakfast pastries really taking the extra step to make us feel welcome.

13112761,127872499,2017-01-21,1168085,Ed,The stay at john's place was perfect. He was super friendly helpful and accommodating. The location was great right between Castro and mission. Plenty to do see and eat nearby. i cannot recommend it more to anyone looking for a relaxing place to stay.
1421774,263305479,2018-05-11,95902122,Stephanie,We loved our stay at Vanick’s place. This is a perfect studio in a great location for easy access to all that SF has to offer. Communication was fantastic and check in was stress-free. We found a bottle of local wine chocolates and coconut water when we arrived. Lovely touches! We also appreciated the guide to local restaurants and shops.
5785978,200833138,2017-10-06,28172211,Sophia,Roberto is a very helpful and caring host. Communication was super easy and the place is super close to public transportation. Only thing: bathroom needs a bit more cleaning and maybe the room ceiling a bit of dusting. Apart from that we had a great stay!
10886231,289616322,2018-07-12,185743974,Anita,Joy was very accommodating to my friends and I. She offered us tea coffee and food. The room was very clean and the entire house was very homey. There were cute animals as well! Joy definitely made San Francisco extremely welcoming for us and we will choose to stay with her again if we ever have the chance!

208727,52570635,2015-10-31,36596468,Stefan,"Robert is THE Airbnb host especially if you're planing on a longer stay and if your are into culture. Leave your travel guides at home! You'll find the perfect guide right in your flat. Born and raised in San Francisco not only does Robert know the City inside out but he will also introduce you to many interesting people. Robert's knowledge about the city's culture history and politics is amazing. You will get to know the best and most inspiring music and arts venues if you want. I stayed in Robert's flat for nearly two months;  R-. frequently offered me to join him on his numerous trips to theaters the Opera concerts and happenings of all kinds. Robert knows all sorts of interesting nice people around town. 
The appartment was exactly as described on Airbnb. The room is small yet clean and quiet (you can sleep with the window open) it has a big bed a desk and enough room to store cloths and all your other stuff. You have your own bathroom. I could use all the other rooms in the flat too. The apprtment is quite big and nicely decorated I felt immediately at home. There's a roof deck where you can enjoy the sun too. The house is located in a quiet area the China and Baker beaches are quite close. There's all sorts of shops and restaurants nearby. It is easy and cheap to get to the Ocean beach and the city center on a bus or using an Uber. "
13021568,345345696,2018-11-04,93903584,Neven,Dear Peihong thank you so much for your hospitality! We enjoyed our stay in SF very much. Uber is rather cheap so we three were in the downtown very fast every day (by headquater of Uber :)
1620039,22169168,2014-10-31,3615272,Philippe,"This place is really well located and the photos and description wonderfully accurate. I 

Stay here and you won't be disappointed. "
657121,332194845,2018-10-04,18448620,Yanan,Great host with a great place. The view from the house is breathtakingly beautiful. The house is full of thoughtful touches and is very family friendly as well. My family including my two young daughters enjoyed the stay very much.
11023703,477178616,2019-06-27,112322203,Hannah,"Absolutely loved this place!!! Honestly the best bed I have ever slept on it’s like a cloud! This little place has all you need washing machine and dryer fridge and microwave hair dryer and iron! Makes your stay so easy! 
It’s not too far out from the main town and there is shops and food very close to the house too! 
Would definitely come back :)"
25368785,507645812,2019-08-11,61039778,Eva,Rawan's place is quiet yet really close to many great Restaurants and stores. Rawan is also very responsive to our requests and the cleaning ladies are friendly and helpful! Would recommend.
16872797,309103039,2018-08-17,139510959,Amber,MY husband and I LOVED our stay with Marie! She was such a gem! clean comfortable room with many thoughtful touches - water bottles little goodies and a fabulous breakfast all provided us with a welcoming and relaxing stay.  We will definitely recommend her to friends!!
12310120,81109437,2016-06-21,67748014,Lewis,Me and my friend overal had a nice quiet stay and we didn't have any major problems. The whole place was fairly clean apart from the wooden floors which needed a vacuum. The bed was comfortable and the whole area we had was very nice! We never actually met Bobby but he did keep communications with us if we needed anything which was nice. The 'kitchette' was only a microwave in terms of cooking so that was something we were a bit disappointed about. I would say this is the perfect place for a short stay but nothing special if you are thinking of staying for more than a couple nights. Thank you 
3563261,109971298,2016-10-23,883427,Linda,Amazing location and the flat is great. Will sent over a list of recommendations in the area food and coffee. We tried a few of the places and loved them. Felt like a local staying in this place. Would book again next time I'm in the area!
40092,208294657,2017-10-31,3880914,Rami,The apartment is spacious and modest and is very comfortable and accommodating. It is located at the heart of the mission a walking distance from many great places: tartine dandelion mission cliffs alamo theatre multiple taquerias bi-rite supermarket & ice cream dolores park and more. Brian is a great host very responsive and always super helpful. Only thing to note is the proximity to Mission st which is perfectly safe but also hosts some colorful homeless people.
20365447,251307718,2018-04-07,65297526,Kayla,The home was super clean and stylish. The entire home is renovated too to bottom. Awesome home away from home!
7345170,281898790,2018-06-25,47933669,Javier (Javi),The only thing that can match the charm of this Victorian home in Mission/Noe Valley its proximity to a diverse selection of restaurants and cafes or the convenience it offers through a short walk to the nearest BART J line (light rail) and bus stations is the outstanding hospitality from Christina and Jack. If you get the opportunity to enjoy an evening wine with them please take it! They are delightful hosts.
20852099,255840922,2018-04-21,40870201,Henry,Jean was kind enough to accommodate our early check-in the place was great and clean with everything we needed. Location was great with some pretty cool spots near by definitely recommend it to anyone staying in San Francisco.
12562572,162614206,2017-06-21,118635187,Guy,"Superbe adresse pour visiter San Francisco.
Transports en commun aisément accessible ( BART à 1 mile = 20 minutes ) ou bus 36 pour se faire déposer à proximité.
Hôtes d'une gentillesse exceptionnelle ayant des valeurs de vie que l'on aimerait voir plus souvent d'une grande disponibilité et très accueillants.
Logement de belle qualité totalement indépendant et permettant de se ressourcer après les ballades à San Francisco.
BRAD nous a même proposé de nous emmener au BART (RER) avec nos sacs le jour du départ pour l'aéroport.
"
7439398,92676254,2016-08-09,50764832,Ilona,"Communication with host was excellent from start to an end of our stay however we were greet by other person then we originally thought we are booking with ( different identity) which make me suspicious at first but had no problems with during the stay. Host was accommodating and helpful. Photo of a bedroom not accurate and you are entering different then picture setting and view with poor indoor lighting which was a problem at evenings there was basic kitchen appliances missing like a kettle and cutlery (only one spoon!).
Sufficient place run similar to european student accomondation rather then luxury apartment block. Convenient location."
2203283,337856134,2018-10-17,130911698,Lan,will stay there again
39875067,560717127,2019-11-07,27562361,Josh,Adel has a comfortable beautiful place. He was a gracious host and had all the amenities that you may need available in the room and bathroom. The bed was super comfortable. He is easy to talk to and enjoyed our short conversation while checking in. I highly recommend his place.

It was close enough to brilliant restaurants within walking distance and the neighbourhood felt very safe. The hosts are really friendly and more than happy to help with whatever you need.
We will be staying here again when we come back!"
25419563,368376544,2019-01-06,43604365,Suzanne,"Stephanie’s place is super cute with a lot of nice little cozy touches. 
It is conveniently located near public transportation making it easy to get where you want to go without having to pay for a cab/lyft. 
Stephanie was always very quick to respond to any of my questions. 
The place is very quiet - I only once heard any noise from upstairs. 
However there is some busy street noise which doesn’t bother me at all but may bother others. 
Overall I had a great stay and would highly recommend Stephanie’s place."
33608274,530331267,2019-09-15,169398707,Lucas,Great!
6378495,231085140,2018-01-30,89880371,Chris,The host canceled this reservation 53 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
23111807,289193830,2018-07-11,159316890,Vignesh,"Extremely clean and silent. 
Steve greeted me when I arrived and was very quick to respond to any queries via text. The bedroom was exactly as it was shown in the pictures the bathroom was great.
There is a small refrigerator in the room ( I didn't use it much).
There isn't much to do in the neighborhood there are a few Taquerias and Chinese Restaurants on Mission St (<1 min walk from the room).

Well connected to downtown SF the 14R bus takes you downtown and there are two Bart stations (Daly City Station and Balboa Park station) both of which are approximately a 15-minute walk from the house.

Also there was complimentary tea and fast Wifi."
3506164,228226814,2018-01-18,20703551,Vik,"Elizabeth was a great host. Even when I had to change my dates last minute she was completely accommodating and responded very quickly.
She's done a wonderful job designing the space. "
16678379,229069538,2018-01-21,55566924,Lyndsey,Michelle was a great host great communication and her place was very clean and as described.  Location was great and parking can tend to be challenging in SF but we were able to find parking fairly close to the Airbnb even late at night.  It was nice to explore the city all day and then have a nice clean place to come back to in order to rest up for the next day.
585326,72589138,2016-05-03,45890281,Charley,"Su's place in the Richmond district was a relaxing location outside of the hustle and bustle of the city.
1 and a half blocks from golden gate park made for a nice afternoon walk. 
Plenty of places to eat only a short walk away. 
Very clean and tidy. Su was very welcoming and happy to assist with any questions.
Would definitely recommend..."
616204,2685388,2012-10-22,3717405,Christopher,Excellent location convenient to everything but also on a quiet street. Jenny went above and beyond to make me and my friends annual trip to San Francisco a success! Thanks we'll definitely stay at Walker's Paradise again! 
1959880,324272154,2018-09-16,51078772,Stephan,We enjoyed our stay at Kristina’s place! With an Uber or the you can reach all of San Francisco’s beautiful spots easily. The room is very clean and stylish. The only thing that is missing in the description is that the shower head is placed in between the sink and the toilet. There’s no cabinet around the shower. Overall I would definitely recommend Kristina’s place! She recommended some nice restaurants and shops around the corner and was a very nice host that made us feel immediately like home.
59381,17784099,2014-08-17,19075652,Sam,Great location walking distance to everything lovely host. If you want to  be in easy reach of all the popular tourist destinations Bill's place is the way to go!

The place is in the basement so don't expect to much light. However it is convenient and at a reasonable price for SF at this time of the year."

20388193,194044187,2017-09-15,26269615,Dan,Overall it was a great stay. The house is beautiful and has an awesome common area to work out of or relax-in. Note BayView is not in the heart of the city so it's a 10 to 15 minute Uber or Lyft to get there but it's worth it for the space. Will re-book next time I visit the Bay!
25547908,293188200,2018-07-19,78530148,Laura,Great place to stay.  Good value for the price!  Easy clean and convenient!!  Would stay again.
212783,132232792,2017-02-16,113840281,Andy,"Had a great week-long stay and was pleasant for the most part. Beds were large and comfy! Location was great with Haight streets being a few short blocks away. Getting in and out of the place was pretty autonomous. The wireless internet service was largely unusable unfortunately especially given the length of the stay. Luckily there was public access to Xfinity WiFi that we were able to use during the time. Be aware that you will be sharing a bathroom with 2 other suites on the same floor so if there are guests in other rooms there may be a wait to go to the bathroom. 

Josh was very responsive and allowed us to leave our luggage in the lobby downstairs after our checkout until we came back."
15633213,164551098,2017-06-28,19778815,Thomas,We really enjoyed our stay at Harry's place. Harry was away while we were visiting but his sister was very welcoming. The house was beautifully furnished and clean. We would definitely stay there again if we were to visit San Francisco in the future. 
23611,144879466,2017-04-16,9119660,Cathrine,I had the most wonderful stay with Cecilia! She is a kind and generous host: was always checking in to see if things were ok would make me delicious fresh orange juice in the mornings and we had the nicest chats. The room and especially the bed are super comfortable; there was even a nice desk for me to work at. The views from the living room are spectacular and it is a short walk to shops restaurants and public transportation. Make sure to take a hike up Bernal Hill to get some sunshine wildflowers and wide-angle views of the City.
144978,919373,2012-02-13,267530,Dennis,This is a simple straight-forward working man's way to live in a nice San Francisco location.  It is handy to downtown Fort Mason and Muni busses.  The street is quiet and the accommodations functional.  And did I say the price is beautiful?
1056844,14865085,2014-06-28,15314450,Megan,Chantal's place was very comfortable and well-located. She has giant windows a nice breeze and her furnishings are interesting and unique. I loves it!  Chantal was easy to get along with and very pleasant. I enjoyed my stay very much. I would definitely stay there again.
12115392,227717132,2018-01-15,250914,Boris,Unbeatable location great value. Ethan was a no-nonsense host who worked extremely well for my tight schedule!
20302991,488874002,2019-07-15,14941236,Suzanne,"Tastefully decorated in a nice area. 
Michael was quick to respond.  No TV was disappointing"
18615032,218748039,2017-12-14,54117274,Andrew,Such an awesome apartment really central and so well appointed! Will definitely stay again! Thanks!
114401,545174094,2019-10-11,4574322,Michèle,Si vous allez à San Francisco n'hésitez pas à séjourner chez George. Vous serez bien accueillis conseillés et vous vous sentirez tout de suite comme chez vous. L'emplacement est idéal la chambre spacieuse la vue magnifique.
142177,19209102,2014-09-08,315794,Vania,La casa e' bella proprio come nelle fotografie con molto spazio e luminosa. L' arredamento e' curato e insieme funzionale. In cucina c'è tutto quel che serve. Il bagno e' un po' piccolo ma l'acqua è' ben calda e si fa un'ottima doccia . I letti sono comodissimi la biancheria e' più del necessario. Noi eravamo due coppie di amici e ci siamo stati benissimo. Abbiamo usati sempre la macchina come consigliato da Noreen perché più comodi e in quattro anche più economico i parcheggi si trovano facilmente e costano il giusto prezzo. Noreen ci ha lasciato molto gentilmente usare il suo garage. Consigliamo vivamente questa casa anche per la posizione in un bel quartiere vicino al Golden Gate e al Presidio (stupendo da vedere assolutamente ). Ottimi anche i consigli sul libro di Noreen su dove mangiare fra tutti eccezionale Ella's per breakfast e brunch.
9752333,277122973,2018-06-15,138086819,Caroline,Peg and Jeff are wonderful attentive friendly hosts who provided a truly exceptional experience in their charming and lovely home. Every detail is considered.   I loved falling asleep with stars overhead and waking to clouds drifting by.  We will return! Thank you for being so helpful.
21730649,405194376,2019-01-26,56975195,Zhong,we had a great stay at Alex's. the experience was much better than we expected.
7009809,55820312,2015-12-06,7198218,Susan,We immediately felt at home. The house was as described and comfortable and clean. The location for our purposes was perfect. Golden Gate Park was easy to get to as were the other sites that we wanted to visit. The 9th Street community area that Voula recommended was interesting we enjoyed coffee at an outside table with bakery items that were superb. The sushi restaurant was very good. The house was perfect for our family get-together. Voula's explanation of the parking situation was accurate we had no problem conforming. Thank you Voula for other considerations---all of us have said that we would return.
132441,508428595,2019-08-12,210667252,Chiara,La casa era molto graziosa è tipica Kurt è stato gentilissimo ad aspettarci per il check in (volo in ritardo di 3 ore). Come detto nella descrizione la casa non è in centro ma si raggiunge facilmente con i mezzi pubblici la fermata è proprio davanti casa.
30534300,494697767,2019-07-24,37625479,Jamie,Everything was great! Kate helped us find a parking spot (as there is only 3 hour street parking from 8 am to 6 pm) it was easy to get to. All around wonderful.
29924753,446973662,2019-05-02,72566103,Nora,Staying at Yara's place was a perfect choice to discover San Francisco. Before the arrival I had doubts how convenient it was going to be because I reserved the room for 5 people but the room the beds and the bathroom were surprisingly spacious with a little backyard accessible through the room. Also it is in a lovely neighborhood with a big station nearby it is approx. 30-40 mins from downtown San Francisco by public transport but it takes only one line from whichever direction to reach it even at night so we were quite satisfied by the accessibility of the place. I can only recommend Yara's place to those who are visiting San Francisco!
30515115,424049689,2019-03-15,248247263,Omar,Solid spot. Great for business trips with a nice quite neighborhood in a lovely location. Hosts were very quick to responds to questions and were very accommodating to our needs. If and when I go back to SF I will definitely be revisiting this spot. Recommended!
1364882,43516782,2015-08-20,27779735,Fay,What a luxurious private retreat!  I'm an antiques dealer with a home furnishings business so I especially appreciated the creative design touches like the electrified industrial ship object on the kitchen counter and the way Corin hung a large starburst mirror on the ceiling.  I travel to SF afew times a year and would like to stay here again.
17576074,230247840,2018-01-27,146063303,Cody,Igor was a great host even though we were unable to meet. He made sure to give very specific instructions for checking in and parking which made it very easy to do by yourself. The bed that I stayed in was extremely comfortable! Great value and would love to stay there again in the future!
33781225,448061105,2019-05-04,162785591,Ethan,We had a wonderful stay at Jessica's. The room was cozy and stocked with whatever we needed. The location is a bit farther from the city (~25 minute uber ride) but it was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle at night for us. One small thing we were unaware of - if there are other guests upstairs it is easily heard through the ceiling and there are posted quiet hours after 10 pm. Overall it was a wonderful stay and we would definitely recommend it!
21863110,542842081,2019-10-06,1835513,Linda,"We spent two nights at Neil’s place. The room was comfortable and we loved that there was a dog in the house :) 
The area was nice had good bars and breakfast places and was close to Mission. 
All in all a good stay!"
24670819,514176882,2019-08-20,22126573,Raphael,"A very nice cosy well-located apartment in San Francisco. A beautiful bathroom and a nice kitchen. A small garden for the breakfast. 
The only negative point : the sound insulation with the main house."
22214202,554152435,2019-10-25,161283297,Jamie Lynn,This was my 2nd stay at Tiffany's listing and I enjoyed it. The place is cozy comfortable and Tiffany is very responsive and caring. I highly recommend!
1121697,106922996,2016-10-08,27439834,Kevin,Giancarlo's apartment is in a great neighborhood and the space is just as pictured. I was in town for work with three coworkers so the layout was perfect. You can tell from looking the pictures but one of the beds is a pull out couch. Giancarlo was extremely friendly and a great host. 
1984709,91477922,2016-08-05,12434656,Jerry,Robby was a great host and the home was more spacious and nicer than the pictures showed (and the pictures already make it look great)! Without question I will be giving Robby a call if I'm in the area again.
5319588,291417958,2018-07-15,122299019,Bobin,Clean house fast response quiet location highly recommended.
2058119,10598309,2014-02-26,11109285,Hassan,Javi's place was immaculate. The room the bathroom and the kitchen were clean and accessible. You can't beat the location; near everything. He was accommodating with the late check-in . Our schedules didn't allow us to meet during my two day stay; until next time. 
1535946,48962417,2015-09-29,1935845,Emlen,Lovely home in a great park of town.  It was my wife and my first trip to San Francisco together and the place was perfect.  Central to everything and Robert was a responsive and attentive host.  The house was well equipped and we felt right at home.
238190,109015773,2016-10-18,20537302,Lauren And Cliff,Beautiful home. Awesome location. Very clean and Bill was an excellent host. 
15069107,350646247,2018-11-19,32358000,Jenny,"The bedroom is quiet and comfortable.  Plenty of storage space. Bathroom alongside - well-equipped.  Friendly quiet and well-behaved dog.  
The flat is situated close to the MUNI (2nd and Kings) and the Caltrain and several useful  bus routes.  Several breakfast places close by and options for evening meals within a few blocks.
If I travel to SF again I would certainly stay here as first choice."
3689368,240461959,2018-03-04,135933740,Karina,The house was lovely with very comfortable beds. It’s a good location walking distance from a super market which was very convenient for my friends and I. Brendan was very responsive to any questions we had and even stopped by to greet us. Loved the hospitality!
5272750,63675810,2016-02-25,9603375,Siyani,"I enjoy a good adventure and unfortunately this one wasn't long enough. I very much so enjoyed the Green Tortoise and its humble fun 70's style hostel environment. Checkin went very smoothly although it was a hard lesson in parking if you get there after the parking lots close (10-11pm). I may have significantly reduced the life of my clutch navigating the hills around the block. Breakfast was tasty and would have loved to have come back for dinner. I'd ""dig"" staying there again. Thank you Green Tortoise!! "
567239,12448309,2014-05-02,9618391,Amber,In a word....bliss. The space is heavenly comfortable quiet if you need it to be but warm and friendly if you decide to strike up a conversation with both Ed and Judy. The location of the house is exquisite with views from every angle of the house...from their deck even from their street of the entire city. Close to Safeway shopping center (walkable) also walkable to 24th street which is filled with quaint shops cafes and restaurants and muni stops/glen park bart station if you really want to venture out. I would strongly recommend these hosts and their listing and stay here again anytime. 
9197404,108306036,2016-10-15,1792047,Inna,We had a great time at Shawn's place! She was an amazing host nice snd caring. And as her pets :). The location of the place is also perfect located at the coolest part of SF. We would definitely made the same choice again!

24000340,367365707,2019-01-04,231014948,Yuman,It was a good stay in Nat’s house and she is very friendly. The common area has some smell of cat pee.
795254,19127720,2014-09-07,16853569,Miriam,"We spent nearly a week in this fantastic attic. It's large enough for 2 people bright very clean and full of character. We felt very comfortable.
The location couldn't be better. Great neighborhood with tons of restaurants coffee shops & bars in walking distance. With public transportation it's very easy to explore the rest of the city.
Jane was very hospitable and provided us with information & recommendations. We loved our stay and highly recommend this spot."
23106047,277592993,2018-06-16,58625317,Hank,We had a great stay here would definitely recommend to others. Great location and space. Jayme and Jeremy are quick communicators and accommodating hosts. Thanks guys!
29906769,541125126,2019-10-04,62933314,Mackenzie,It was a perfect stay for our one night in SF.  Upon arrival we were greeted with great attentiveness. Provided us recommendations to do around the area and walked through the studio. Very safe neighborhood. Parking on the street was easy.
545685,8704537,2013-11-12,6111341,Leah,"Highly recommend! We absolutely loved Linda's Garden Suite with it's queen bed private bathroom and little kitchen area. Both the neighborhood and the place itself was cozy neat and quiet. It's a great place to unwind after a busy day in the city. There was nothing better than waking up and having a cup of coffee (supplies graciously provided by the host!) in the backyard after a peaceful night's sleep in the warm inviting suite.

Communication with Linda was also very easy. Instructions and information about the place were clear and concise. And since we were in and out at odd hours the key pad locks also made it the most convenient check-in possible. Thank you Linda for a great stay!"
465723,299847275,2018-07-31,121404052,Diane,My boyfriend and I came to SF to visit family and see some of the popular sights. Shelia’s place is in a nice neighborhood with the great bonus of having a guaranteed parking spot. The location is convenient to several tourist spots and her place had everything we needed. Shelia’s replies to my questions prior to check-in was very timely and helpful. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone and stay there again if possible.
2279254,52499672,2015-10-30,44491128,Cassie,Really easy and smooth  great location super clean. everything was great! They were even able to accommodate an earlier checkin. 
6911587,201628510,2017-10-08,28622844,Jd & Lisa,You can't get a better location for a better value if you want to be in the mission. Todd and his family are lovely hosts and staying at their place is comfortable welcoming and convenient.
8974563,510234993,2019-08-15,57273645,Claire,Fantastic place to stay Craig was so helpful prior to arrival providing all the information you would need. Definitely recommend here for short city breaks.
24036000,561143910,2019-11-08,290673342,Eve,My partner and I had a great few days in San Fransisco - Andrew and Lianna are great hosts and gave good recommendations for restaurants and things to see around the local area. The space itself is stylish spotless and comfortable (you also get a sense of additional privacy due to the layout of the property) - I would highly recommend. Thanks again for having us!
14068781,522282215,2019-09-01,270430833,Abelina,A wonderful stay! Boyfriend and I decided to go to SF for the weekend to celebrate my birthday it was a lovely visit and the home was amazing! The pets are so friendly and add a very nice comforting touch there are endless amenities and overall just had an amazing ambiance and welcoming atmosphere.  A great choice that I highly recommend for any extended venture in SF.
33578,10036230,2014-01-27,949415,Laurel,"I love staying at Kepa's. It quiet safe and has easy parking. It's really fun neighborhood and the accommodations are the best!

6015077,149848463,2017-05-06,76635939,Linda,Really great place to stay in San Francisco.  Very close to public transport.  The apartment was clean and well furnished with a great view of the Ocean.
4695477,299846790,2018-07-31,63636766,Karrah,The cottage exceeded our expectations. It was very clean and there was plenty of space for 2 guests. My sister and I enjoyed the local shopping and restaurants. 
409549,335612636,2018-10-12,7999514,Renee,"You will not be disappointed staying at Mary’s place in Bernal Heights! Featuring two self contained bedrooms a very large living space that included futon beds and a pull-across curtain for privacy (creating a third bedroom) and large dining table/space and kitchen with modern appliances and big center breakfast bar where we were able to enjoy breakfast and catch up on emails etc in a stress-free environment.

Mary also provided us with an array of breakfast supplies that helped us relax even more! 

All in all we had a wonderful stay and it was also great fun to share the Bernal Hill village and lookout with my parents (who were visiting from Australia) - an SF neighborhood i would otherwise not likely have had time to show them around."
2134475,522901325,2019-09-02,113447390,Christina,This was my first experience with renting a room instead of an entire apartment or studio. I was a bit concerned prior to arrival b/c I didn't really know what to expect. That immediately went away when they answered the door. The smile and welcoming attitude made me feel welcomed. Over the next few days we felt right at home the more we learned about them. When leaving it was like leaving family. I highly recommend anyone  to stay with them. Especially if you want a great cup of coffee! I absolutely love them!  Plus their location is easily accessible to the entire city. They have set the bar high for all my future travels!
14268636,173131505,2017-07-22,48003765,Greg,Julian was a most fantastic host. The room was clean and well furnished. You couldn't turn a corner without perfectly placed snacks staring you down and he had multiple cereal boxes for the late-night cravings. He was a kind good-humored host quick to resupply toiletries and anything edlse lacking. I highly recommend the Meerkat Manor.
1392204,17273904,2014-08-10,11597333,Nancy,What a true pleasure to stay with Dee! She was helpful and chatty but not overbearing. It was nice to hear about the local flavor of San Francisco during some opportunities we had to visit with her. The house has wonderful views and was clean and the sleeping and bathroom spaces were private. The bed was a full which made for a tight sleeping space for two people but there were two other twin beds available if we'd chosen to sleep separately. Dee made herself available to ask questions but we didn't have many since she provided everything we needed plus more (extra towels some toiletries...). The neighborhood is away from the hubbub of downtown but close enough to take a quick and easy ride on one of the Muni options. I highly recommend staying here!
968046,255208717,2018-04-19,165608566,Darryn,PK and Kiki were the perfect hosts. Their apt is impeccably clean and their warmth and friendliness made my stay even more remarkable.
4269254,262704682,2018-05-09,126954845,David,Close to public transportation the Safeway across the street was very convenient. Marjorie is very personable and helpful. A great stay if you don’t mind being in Japantown.
15888446,175031022,2017-07-27,38159880,Ellen,I stayed with Rick while attending a conference at Moscone Center.  It is an ideal location for that venue only 2 short blocks or a 5-7 min walk to the convention center with a Whole Foods Market and Peets Coffee on the way.  The guest room is spacious private clean and very comfortable.  The location is on a quiet street.  But the best part of my stay was meeting Rick and Colin who were both incredibly kind gracious and hospitable.  They made my visit to SF much more enjoyable than if I'd stayed at a convention hotel.   I highly recommend this AirBnB!

We celebrated our X'mas in this lovely house.  If we ever come back to San Francisco I will definitely try to book this place.  Thanks Irina for sharing such beautiful home.
114401,6737592,2013-08-23,7793522,Francois,It was my first time travelling on my own and I think staying at George's was the best choice! I felt I was staying at a friends house! The flat is 5mn walk from the main bars in Castro. So perfect location! The room was clean quiet and spacious. All in all highly recommended!
21327347,537441125,2019-09-28,281680465,Christopher,Anna & Michael's place was perfect for our visit. It has a fantastic location just a half block from Golden Gate Park and walking distance to the beach. They were gracious hosts and will book with them the next time I visit San Francisco!

The house is authentic and interesting. Which is better than a typical boring room in a new place. Bed is comfortable and Connie does everything to make you feel at home in her house. 

I loved the place and I slept very well in a comfortable home."
26470581,561124100,2019-11-08,62452366,Ann,Barbara’s home is beautiful and in a great location in Noe Valley. Her home had nice touches such as the heated toilet seats and snacks. Would definitely stay here again in the future!
5253439,86976108,2016-07-18,82833747,Marie,Only come here if you are looking for an absolutely amazing time!  The house was a 5 minute walk to tons of fun restaurants bars shops... anything you could ever want to experience in San Francisco!  The hosts were extremely kind informative and welcoming.  They went above and beyond to make sure everyone had a blast!  I was a little nervous coming here as it was my first air bnb experience but I felt very safe the whole time.  It is going to be hard to beat this experience and I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great time exploring the city!  10/10
5394755,73464930,2016-05-08,15633193,Maximilian,Dominic and his wife welcomed me very warmly in their house. They are very easy to chat with and provided coffee every morning even if I got up late during the weekend. The house is very nice and located in the Mission district. There are tons of restaurants or bars just around the corner.
2436213,526932607,2019-09-09,29407742,Wayne,Phyllis is a perfect host.  She is very kind and helpful.  She respects personal privacy.  Her place is a dream.  The room was sizable and well appointed.

I received the e-mail from Dana at check-in day and been told that our reservation has been cancelled due to The Donatello made a mistake and overbooked.  But Dana is very kind and fix the problem so quickly and book the expensive hotel --Westin for us to stay.  
Dana is very kind and responsible person.  I will definitely choose her place when we visit SF in the future.

Her location in the inner sunset is ideal for natives returning to visit family (like us) or for first time tourists that want a great central location to explore the city from. 

The space itself is very stylish and well thought out with many great touches. 

We were very happy and comfortable there. Highly recommend!"

15005046,105720235,2016-10-02,16734466,Christine,"Beautiful neighborhood! Close enough to the action (we're car people) yet feels like you're in a coastal town. Parking was never a problem plenty of space on the street (and we brought our limo. Kidding.). 
The apartment itself feels like a tree house all green outside the windows. It is impeccably renovated was super clean and welcoming. Thank you for the flowers fruit and coffee! 
The bathroom is a white oasis with heated floors Grade A water pressure and temperature. The bed was very comfortable.
I appreciated the broom and pan in the kitchen it was easy to clean up after ourselves.
Other than an oven the kitchen has everything pots and pans dishwasher well you can read the details of the listing. We brought a cooler with food filled the large fridge and made some tasty breakfast.
Both hosts introduced themselves. They are just the nicest people.
I hope our boys weren't too loud -- we only heard walking or moving from above a few times but it was nowhere near a bothersome noise level.
I hope we can come stay here again!"

2042095,402492267,2019-01-18,545420,Dan,Lovely room well appointed even with a freshly baked cookie.  Lawrence and his partner were a wealth of local information and even gave me a ride from the train.  Would happily stay again.

The place is spotless clean and has everything you may need during your time in the city (some food to get you started coffee and tea toiletries washer and dryer...). Very comfortable bed.

Mimi and Mosh are fantastic hosts! Communication was very easy at any time. They will make sure to provide you with any useful information you may need to have the most enjoyable stay in the city. Highly recommended!"

8474183,86723783,2016-07-17,58369909,Stacia,Jonathan was very welcoming and made it very simple for me to access the apartment while he wasn't home. The accommodations were very comfortable and the Kuerig coffee options were perfect for the morning! I would definitely stay here again if I needed a place in SF!

60365,464519,2011-08-22,353701,Véronique,"La maison d’Emilie est parfaite bien placée grande très bien équipée.
Nous avons trouvé tout ce dont nous avions besoin (lave linge sèche linge lave vaisselle linge…) elle est également d’une propreté irréprochable.
La maison est à 200 mètres des bus (toutes les 5 minutes) et à 350 m du métro… C’est idéal pour visiter San Francisco.
Le contact avec Emilie est très sympathique ses explications sont très claires merci beaucoup.
A ne pas douter si  nous retournons à San Francisco nous reprendrons cette maison nous ne pouvons que la conseiller à tous…

1489175,66927182,2016-03-25,17469530,Simrat,Excellent. Appreciated the parking easy access to highways & public transport clean home and the nice community.
10835637,416592268,2019-02-24,41508677,Andrea,Trey is amazing. I appreciate his communication and his thoroughness. I have no complaints except that I had to go back to work. I attended a work conference here and I could have been happier about the location.
468751,244836842,2018-03-19,37268742,Michelle,Great location easy walking distance to public transport and sights. Spacious Terrance was very helpful.
3759368,47646133,2015-09-21,35155463,Roger,We had a great time staying at Leo and Dan's place. The location was ideal for us it's not too far from main attractions and at the same time situated in a quiet neighborhood upon the hill. The street parking pass was a big plus and we were able to park more or less right outside the house. The accommodation we needed was as described and spacious enough for just the two of us. We did not get to meet Leo but nevertheless communication by message etc was adequate enough. 
15343159,127603983,2017-01-19,68431492,方鸯鸯,Michelle was very nice. The room was clean and beautiful and there's a black board on the wall so you can draw anything as you want. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. I had a wonderful time in San Francisco.
7949668,511665692,2019-08-17,5956220,Cameron,Great room at the top of the hill. Walking down to the coffee shop was always spectacular because the views are amazing.

3946571,33067521,2015-05-25,26718823,Natalia,Nana and I had such a wonderful stay with Lisa and Shiloh. We felt so welcome Lisa was so kind It was a really lovely change from staying in hotels. She went above and beyond and even organised an air mattress for me which she'd never done before it was so appreciated. We didn't spend a lot of time there as we were out and about seeing all of the sights but we were lucky to have enjoyed her beautiful breakfast on our last day the scones were amazing I particularly loved the ginger and her homemade spreads were delicious we were actually not even hungry till dinner time!!! Thank you so much for a wonderful stay it really was the perfect end to an incredible holiday thanks Lisa xxx
4892016,233235554,2018-02-08,18941666,Alex,Great vale for the location we were not disappointed.  Check in and check out was easy coffee and muffins in the morning were a nice touch.  I would stay here again.
19830610,345712142,2018-11-05,35161357,Carol,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay in Ian’s flat.  It was immaculately clean very comfortable and thoughtfully designed.  My husband enjoyed watching the World Series on the large screen tv mounted on an original brick wall.  My favorite spot was by the fire pit on the spacious outdoor deck.

We were in SF to visit our children who live in nearby Mission Bay.  We wanted to stay in Dogpatch and were fortunate to find Ian’s place.  The location of the flat was perfect for our needs.  The neighborhood offers many charming shops restaurants and galleries.  The Just For You Cafe around the corner is a MUST stop for breakfast and/or lunch.   Getting around the city is easy with the muni stops just steps outside the door.

To top it all off Ian was an outstanding and helpful host making our visit a very memorable one.

Thank you Ian!"
442397,488942478,2019-07-15,234480531,Mike,Great location on tramline. Some welcome food was left for us and was much appreciated.
7290262,98595410,2016-08-31,60099046,Mimi,Trevor made me feel very welcome for the entirety of my stay. They were helpful kind and friendly. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in San Francisco!

10767861,237937359,2018-02-24,25241016,Raj,Vishal is a very accommodating and welcoming host. Every part of the check in process was very well thought out and he was very flexible on check-in day. The apartment is in a great location; you can catch the light rail or subway along Market Street to get wherever you want to go. The guest room is very spacious and comfortable. We look forward to staying again!
10251,6031808,2013-07-27,5486235,Evelyn,Roman & Sarah's apartment is very roomy bright beautifully cared for and comfortable--a great home-base from which to explore San Francisco. Roman was our main contact and was a fine host with lots of info to share.  The kitchen is well stocked with basics and you can pick up whatever you need from nearby bodegas and the very-worth-visiting Rainbow Market (organic coop) a few blocks away.  It is a safe neighborhood but this is a big city so there will be areas you will want to avoid--your hosts can guide you.  We parked on the streets nearby though you will have to move your car for scheduled street cleaning.  We got around easily using our 3-day MUNI pass rented bikes near Golden Gate Park and walked...which helped balance our caloric intake from all the great food we enjoyed! 
4902855,354416203,2018-12-01,30783760,Michael,Great value! Awesome location and as easy as any check in process can get
14386727,167439292,2017-07-06,50735838,皓,Sean is very nice if you don't care sharing the house with someone else this place is a good choice.
909063,65137943,2016-03-11,44409436,Tanja,"I had a superb stay at Rafael and Mark's and highly recommend this accommodation. They are amazing hosts. They looked after every detail including postcards and First-Aid-Kit. The room was cosy clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfortable and there was also a desk for firing up the notebook. Coffee tea milk juice cereal were available and Mark made Coffee for me in the morning. He made lots of suggestions what to do in San Francisco and once he took me with his car to the de Young Museum! Whilst I really enjoyed interacting with them I was also afforded the privacy when I wanted it. It was up to me to decide how much I wished to interact or be left alone. 
The BART-Station and the MUNI-Bus stop are only a short walk away and there are also lots of restaurants and shops nearby."
14996188,410763366,2019-02-10,8883271,Julia,This place in incredible. The attention to detail (pour over coffee homemade granola sparkling water and a great city guide) made for a very cozy feel. Even on an rainy weekend - this place felt bright and cheery. Stay here you won’t regret it.
6331695,558192794,2019-11-02,695478,Caroline,Wow this is probably my favorite Airbnb in SF! The views are beautiful and really comfortable and private. Great value for the money too.
7222704,282229856,2018-06-26,150621003,Krystal,Great local spots around the location! The neighborhood is so calm and beautiful. The space was great and had great San Francisco charm.
10905721,498499551,2019-07-29,11807566,Eric,Prma Airbnb is SF. Foto’s suggereb een groter huis dan het in werkelijkheid is. Prijs/kwaliteit is hierdoor een beetje scheef
45299,475082145,2019-06-23,43629523,Daniel,"El studio de Chas se destaca por su inmejorable ubicación para visitar el distrito de Castro.
Esta ubicado a pocos pasos de los bares restaurantes el Teatro Castro.

598271,13009972,2014-05-17,5278185,Chelsie,I had a nice stay at Fran's place. It is a beautiful spot that's well taken care of. Fran most definitely pays great attention to detail and made me feel very welcome in her home. There was a pretty consistent shuffle of other guests staying in the room down the hall from mine. It did not affect my stay at all but is something to consider if you are looking for a very private experience. 
44032,914902,2012-02-12,1382811,James,Secret lounge is cosy and overall a great place to stay. located near lots of cool coffee shops food and transit.

14938407,136278605,2017-03-09,19935339,Alex,Glad I came here everything was clean and I slept comfortably. Host was able to communicate via phone when we needed something and had a great experience overall
4022209,526396288,2019-09-08,285800189,Charlotte,The bathroom was very clean but the carpet was sticky and we woke up with bug bites from what may have been bed bugs.
23900160,254703569,2018-04-17,51201458,Chris,Amazing location- go to Cliff restaurant for brekkie and go along coastal walk to Golden Gate Bridge. Place is clean functional and good privacy.

10235526,66011444,2016-03-18,16436494,Matt,"Lawrence was a pleasant gracious host. The condo was nice the bed was comfortable (memory foam and really soft sheets) and the bathroom was clean. My interaction with Lawrence was limited since I was out fairly early in the morning and returned late but he greeted me when I first arrived and we were able to chat for a few minutes and I found him to be a nice engaging person. He was accomdating of my schedule and everything went exactly as I would have expected.

The location is great - close to the Moscone and a lot of things to do in the SoMa area. But as with any downtown area in a big city that also means there is some road noise. As a seasoned traveller I always take earplugs so it was never an issue. It is certainly not bad enough to affect a recommendation. I would definitely stay with Lawrence again."
7949668,286611947,2018-07-06,3945638,Susan,Charming accommodations in quiet Potrero hills with shared bathroom.

Geoff sent a lot of helpful information prior to my arrival. He always replied within minutes. "
15075530,219132449,2017-12-16,19474942,Danilo,Tim was awesome he was very good in communication. The place in great perhaps once you ad the cleaning fees and the other fees turns more that you expect. Parking is terrible I had to parked almost 3 blocks far away.
3486460,531083209,2019-09-16,46801461,Frank,Beautifully clean and very nice quiet location near everything.  I couldn’t have asked for better

183859,364953811,2018-12-31,39090037,Alison,This was a perfect place to stay when in San Francisco. The neighbourhood was quiet and very friendly with the local 'village' providing a range of services and dining options and the canyon park and rec centre just around the corner. Very easy access to public transport options too. Stephen's place was great with everything we needed (and more) provided during our stay. The extra touches like a range of tea coffee and hot chocolate options the fresh orange juice and the delicious local sourdough provided were great. Self catering was a breeze here - even cooking our Christmas dinner! Stephen was an excellent host sharing 'insider' knowledge and tips about visiting local sites and events. Thanks for a great stay we hope to return soon!
2093695,45551801,2015-09-04,31205831,Lisa,We had a wonderful stay at jennifer's House. We arrived Late at Night which was no Problem for her. It's just a few minutes to walk to the next muni Station which drives directly to the Heart of the City. Thanks a lot Lisa and tim 
10469182,101726544,2016-09-14,41494793,Natalie,Landy was a fantastic host. She came down on our first evening and gave us the lay of the land giving us suggestions about fun things to do or restaurants to visit in the area. She knew we would be using public transit so she has maps available for us. Bonus - there's a bus stop about 1.5 blocks away. One thing to be aware of - she and her family live upstairs and are active in the evenings. You'll hear footsteps and such but it wasn't anything that disturbed us too much. All in all my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our time in San Francisco staying at Landy's place. Thank you! 
7054235,74696970,2016-05-16,32567641,Gwendolyn,"We enjoyed our stay at Benjamin´s place. It was neat and comfortable and just a few short blocks to the lovely Sunset Beach and fun eateries. Thanks Benjamin
"
9471416,82583064,2016-06-28,39599552,Kelleigh,Marie provided everything I needed to know before arriving. It was very helpful. While she personally could not be there due to her own travels I felt well cared for. The house is lovely and in a nice neighborhood. 
1665516,126300538,2017-01-10,108061522,Matthew,This was my first experience using Airbnb so I wasn't sure what to expect but wow was I blown away by this home. Adam&Roz's are truly great host as they made the home so comfortable for us as they made sure you have everything you needed for your stay and more. The home is so nice and very clean. The home is located in great neighborhood with good restaurants and markets near by and also close distance to every other part of city. I would recommend anyone wanting to stay in San Francisco to stay at this home as this is one of the best homes in the city also don't forget about Rupert their adorable dog always greeting you with a smile at the door. 
8684508,92223732,2016-08-08,82679703,Anna-Lena,Easy access easy check-in and a unbeatable price for this location right in the middle of San Fran. The Rooms are minimalistic and good everything you need for visiting this city! 
596042,7833647,2013-10-05,8683182,Arpita,Had a wonderful and hassle-free stay at Jay's. Very nice room good location and a great host. Jay was very clear and helpful with directions to her house as well as with advice on nearby stores places getting around etc. Room is nice and cosy with a very comfortable bed. My first airbnb experience couldnt have asked for a better one. Thank you Jay.
26261610,488287119,2019-07-14,123264010,Benjamin,Very cozy and clean place to stay with a short walk to the ocean to boot. Simple check-in process. Very satisfied overall.
11949198,98753053,2016-09-01,11486202,Manuel,Laurence and Nick were great hosts welcoming me in their ecclectic attic apartment with marvellous views. Even though the apartment has paper thin walls and as a consequence you have to step lightly when walking in the apartment I never had any problems with other guests or the hosts. The bathtub/toilet situation took a while to get used to as I am fairly tall and could therefore not stand up straight when taking a shower. But since this was communicated beforehand it was no big deal. Nick emailed me frequently with hints regarding hidden treasures in the area which are certainly helpful for people who have never been to SF. Overall I recommend this apartment particularly due to its prime location and marvellous view.

20155597,219930364,2017-12-19,38798494,George & Brenda,"The location and private parking were a huge plus.  The kitchen has everything you need and the bathroom was also very nice.  Good water pressure and beautiful tile work.  There was lots of extra space for suitcases.
We took advantage of Netflix and Amazon Movies at the end of busy days.  The cheese market one block over was fantastic and had all we needed for food and wine.  We liked being able to walk for casual dining close by.
Mathew was a wonderful host and responded quickly to us.  The city has so much to offer and we loved that it was easy access anywhere we wanted to explore."
1984709,60143206,2016-01-19,36591477,Cristina,All the great reviews listed here are one hundred percent accurate. The place was lovely clean and an excellent location for exploring the city. We truly enjoyed our time there. We spent a lot of time at Golden Gate Park which is just a short walk away. The neighborhood was also fantastic . Bonus: There was ample parking (a rarity in SF).
22469468,403827739,2019-01-21,138197509,Nhi,This AirBNB was beautiful! The room offers a great view of the city and the upstairs balcony offers an ever better view. It is one of the best views that you can get for this very affordable price. The bed and down comforter were extremely comfortable. You get your own private bathroom! There is a small area by the closet with a fold out table that was extremely convenient. In this area there was also complimentary tea/coffee/hot water. The room itself was cute and had everything you could need (we watched a few episodes on Netflix on the TV). Our flight landed at noon and Cedric and Jun were extremely helpful and let us store our luggage before our actual check in while we went out to explore the city. We used Uber to get to go to Ferry Market Downtown SF Mission district Golden Gate park etc. It was about a 10-15min Uber to wherever we needed to go so it was an extremely convenient location.
12155285,79786264,2016-06-14,69694885,Valerie,Emily's home is very comfortable clean and beautiful! I had a wonderful stay there. She even left a list of recommended places to see and restaurants to go to in the area (all the ones I had the chance to visit were fantastic). Not to mention the view from her house is probably the best in the city! You can see the entire city. It's a great neighborhood quiet if you want some distance from the city but also within walking distance of restaurants. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone visiting San Francisco!
1750093,550408556,2019-10-18,199532184,Emmett,Nice downstairs room. Perfect for a quick business trip into the city or a wee visit. The family was very welcoming and the location is good. The multi-pane windows did a remarkable job blocking out the the street noise so it's easy to get a good night's sleep. The Sleep Number bed is great if your picky about your mattress.

5905163,30430620,2015-04-21,31105038,Thomas,We made arrangements to meet by text and it worked out quite well. They provided a parking space for our car. The room and bed were quite comfortable. We had a very positive experience. Coffee muffins and good conversation while not a part of the package were delightful. 
23685560,261061003,2018-05-05,282776,Vikram,Laily & Tracy’s place is a beautiful spot on the border of Bernal Heights and Bayview. I stayed there for a week for work. They’re communicative and their spot is gorgeous and clean. Highly recommend it.

934012,157106815,2017-06-02,55048606,Hannah,Had a wonderful stay at David's place. Had all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay and the location couldn't be beat. Close to public transportation restaurants and one block off of golden gate park. In particular we loved having an outdoor space in the back where we could sit on the patio and let our dog get some fresh air. Great value would recommend!
10883329,333072243,2018-10-06,10868313,Luis,It's a very good spot in SF coliving and coworking space you can connect with entrepreneurs and have recommendation of the events in the bay area. Awesome Community Manager and efficient coworking space. Recommended if you don't need 5 stars hotels.

31124126,510163061,2019-08-15,160992103,Myo,Decent place to stay around 30-45 minutes bus ride to downtown. Walls can be a bit thin but bedding is comfortable and amenities like the bathroom are great!
18548006,165093146,2017-06-30,9330161,Adrien,"I highly recommend this place. We had a great experience staying here for a week. It's very spacious and a completely private place and everything was very clean and new.

Amenities and snacks coffee and everything was very thoughtfully prepared. 

Although we haven't really met because we had a separate entrance to the house whenever I had any problem or a question Scott and Jennifer were responsive within a minute and helped us.

We used lyft or rental car during our stay so the location and a bit of a distance from the city center was not a problem for us and it was very easy to street park nearby."
18675661,336843796,2018-10-14,90765242,Dean,Great roomy and clean Clean CLEAN.  Loved Pete’s place for location in the Castro and near the muni station with access to everywhere else.    Supermarket flower shop drug store one black away.  Quick easy communication and very accommodating.
17696905,305111384,2018-08-10,46733417,Emily,"Commune is right - everything is shared and everyone pitches in to run the hostel! Very fun idea to experience so not your normal hostel but very welcoming and cool! Would call it somewhere between a hostel and a B&B - where you have run of the kitchen. Guests seem a little second to the people who regularly live in the house but that’s expected as you’re staying in their home. Cleaning service came every day & made the bed & cleaned our area. Fun fact about the room - we had our own sink so that made getting ready so easy! 
Great location to the rest of SF and easy to get to all the key neighborhoods. "
10137578,177422334,2017-08-02,102443255,Srishti,Totally worth it.

25443874,529399375,2019-09-14,24892949,Hannah,"Stayed for 3 nights as SF first timers wanting to save a bit of money. The location was great.. public transport around the corner a great pub on the next block and an abundance of restaurants at the top of the road.. we ate nearby every day and everything was great!

Comfy bed really clean. Clear instructions and house rules!"
26950540,456142288,2019-05-20,109382433,Seul,Xiomara is a good host and indeed I acknowledge that part. Location is good; the house and facilities are good though your feeling comfortable is dependent on the host’s hospitality or contingency.
2518781,200836401,2017-10-06,97994140,Dustin,This place is perfect. Located in an amazing area. Only minutes away from everything in the city via Lyft or Uber. The space was very clean welcoming and cozy. I see no reason to ever stay anywhere else while in SF. We had a great time! Thanks!
3718865,27145092,2015-02-26,17822950,Carla,I'd arrived on the West Coast a few days prior to staying with Katie. I was driving the coast with my fiance. We'd stayed in quite a few hotels that weren't up to par... So what a nice surprise to arrive at Katie's! Clean big and the bathroom was AMAZING. The sleeping quarters are like a bat cave ensuring good sleep after gathering travel fatigue. I also missed my dog SO much and let Katie know this. So she greeted me with her dog Steve who is the cutest!!! Ended up taking Steve on a walk and he helped ease the pain of leaving my dog behind.  Thanks for the great stay!

The location is very convenient and the room is remarkably quiet despite the apartment being on a main street. Highly recommended. "
13318584,83795628,2016-07-04,21827255,A.P.,Rigo greeted us upon our stay and let us check in quite early which was really nice. They had lots of extra touches that made our stay nice such as coffee treats fresh flowers and a bottle of wine. Super nice touch everything was very clean and well kept. The neighborhood was a little sketchy driving in but they have done a wonderful job on making this place feel like home and safe. They were extremely easy to contact for recommendations and questions. Overall loved our stay a little bit out of town which was nice and quite but just expect at least a half hour to get downtown. Would stay again!
29874095,460239707,2019-05-28,86308339,Yolanda,I enjoy my stay here! Sparking clean large space and access to all the facilities. But maybe don’t walk outside at night (I took Uber out and back so it didn’t affect me) Overall I’m satisfied with my stay!

2046807,31060630,2015-05-01,1766198,Leah,The place was clean and very conviently located. Lots of amazing restaurants and cafes within 5 minute walk. Kevin was very easy to communicate with and checked in with us to make sure everything was ok. Place is quite small but great if you are looking for a place to crash after exploring the city! 
545685,53377127,2015-11-08,45687408,Dora,"The unit was great and very clean and was exactly how it was described.  I liked that the unit was separate which made it comfortable to come and go as I pleased.

This location has 2 different units and on my last night there some other guests had occupied the second unit.  There was no issue and I didn't even see the other guests but the units are separated by a door and they tended to be a bit loud at some times."

7886634,563421410,2019-11-12,58617572,Jonathan,This was a great place for a four night getaway for two tired parents. Close access to public transit as well as the Castro restaurants were very much in walking distance (especially Spike's Coffee - best veggie sandwich). We would definitely stay there again next time we are in San Francisco!
1043282,73905770,2016-05-11,46237426,Debbi,john welcomed us as if we were family! A gracious  talented  and down to earth man! Loved our conversations with him and meeting some of his friends! Castro is a magnificent area... Friendly and close to public transportation! We felt safe there!

4093967,331440540,2018-10-02,1780035,Nicole,Skate and Jeannie where amazing hosts with an amazing home. It was my boyfriend and my first time in San Francisco and I don’t think we could have picked a better place to stay. Their house is full of color and charm the neighborhood has so many great places to check out  and their garden is unbelievable—I wanted to stay forever! Do yourself a favor and book  with Skate and Jeannie  :)
8351923,161323668,2017-06-17,117009746,Leen,De kamer was mooi en proper. Er was niets op aan te merken. Goede ligging dichtbij het openbaar vervoer. 
8101297,219535433,2017-12-17,22755795,Michael,The place was in a great location and easy to move in and out of throughout the day. Plenty of space in the bedroom and a cozy overall apartment as well. Anthony was very easy to communicate with via email and direct message.  I recommend!
1148625,30408402,2015-04-21,26700851,Mauricio,"Dennis is a great host. His home is lovely and quiet. Everything was clean and tidy. 
Unfortunately I couldn't arrive until 1 hour after the agreed time but he gave me good instructions on how to get into the house and he even had some printed guidelines about how things worked at his home (like wifi shower etc). 
Dennis barely was at home during the weekend I stay there so the privacy was remarkable. 
I would definitely return to his house if I ever return to San Francisco."
8277718,80233161,2016-06-17,45779675,Meith Bimal,Melanie and her family were excellent hosts. We felt very much at home. It was like staying with our own family. We are new to San Francisco and they helped us a lot in looking for apartments here. Her dogs are cute and very friendly too ! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. 
20957480,257895530,2018-04-27,8733182,Michael,Renu's place is a great value for still being in the city. It's not a far walk from the MUNI and the separate entrance is helpful for returning late. They're very quick to respond and easy to talk to. There's almost a full kitchen but I wouldn't count on cooking any meals there. Best for reheating take out.
545685,101698239,2016-09-14,38468897,Ryan,"We had a great visit to SF and loved staying in the garden suite. The accommodations were very nice the sheets were soft and the bathroom was very clean. The mini fridge and microwave was helpful for our leftovers from restaurants in the city. Very close to Golden Gate Park.  We would definatley stay here again. Thank you very much!
-Ryan and Geneva"
964952,3866182,2013-03-22,210882,Gaurav,I normally reside in SF but was in a situation where I needed a place to stay and Peining's place far exceeded my expectations.  It's a beautiful apartment with all the amenities that you would possibly need (and more) and in a fun neighborhood.  There is a lot of space a wonderfully equipped kitchen high-end entertainment system (including speakers in the bathroom) and three very quiet and comfortable bedrooms.  The apartment is also impeccably clean.  Peining is very friendly and easy to communicate with.  I'd love to stay here again.  Highly recommended.  Thanks Peining!
18140914,253539022,2018-04-14,115235268,Filiberto,Great place in a quiet neighborhood. My hosts were very responsive and attentive. I would definitely stay here again.

21745893,561552706,2019-11-09,3411867,Michael,"The cozy room and the accommodation was absolutely clean! The accommodation is very easy to reach and nearby there are 2 good shops and the public transportation. There are also some really good restaurants nearby. The two hosts have many good tips on what you can do and will help you if need anything.

The equipment in the condo is great and everything you need is there. Even breakfast is meant.

Short and simple: The best Airbnb we've ever had. Thank you!"
867530,189769733,2017-09-02,86581801,Kristin,Cat & EB are great hosts! They worked with our weird arrival schedule had info on the area waiting for us (including tips on how to get around and most importantly where to get the best coffee!!) and basic info on how to get around with the BART and MUNI systems. This place isn't in downtown SF but that's part of the appeal I think. It's much quieter than staying downtown.
2130640,483518258,2019-07-07,25941276,Jeffrianne,Lovely apartment in a hip quiet neighborhood. Close to a great cafe for coffee pastries and breakfast. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The owners were very friendly and responsive. The place is set up very well for families with children. It was clean and tidy. The downstairs level can be a bit cool but space heaters are provided and work well for cooler San Francisco evenings. Street parking was generally quite easy either on the street or around the corner although it required frequent moving the car during the weekdays.
12041223,403812852,2019-01-21,14519088,Matt,I live near the area and booked this place for my mom and sister to stay when visiting. Great location and nice hosts. Cool neighborhood.

We look forward to another visit so we can sit down with a glass of wine. The room was spacious clean cozy and quiet. Great neighborhood walking distance to lots of tasty restaurants and attractions. Carl also gave us a detailed list of recommendations for places to eat in the neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again!

28079865,528795658,2019-09-13,18943344,Valerie,This is such a great place for the value and location! Just a couple blocks from Union Square you won't find hotel rooms this big for this price in the area. It's basically a one bedroom suite with a little kitchenette and living room. Very comfortable and spacious! And having a gym in the building was great for a longer stay. I'd definitely stay again. Thanks a lot!
7035672,272548694,2018-06-03,29798585,Marissa,Kyle and Andrea were very responsive and hospitable. Their place was very comfortable for us on our first trip with an infant. From the bassinet to the heavenly bed  the kitchen and the parking spot and access to laundry we had all the comforts of home in a quiet neighborhood of a busy city.  We also had nice conversation. We will definitely be back.

1206233,59221687,2016-01-08,8153517,Samantha,The location was wonderful - right in the middle of a very vibrant and interesting area and conveniently accessible by public transport. Ashir was very welcoming and helpful - he gave us detailed instructions on how to get there from the airport and where to find the key as well general info about the house and where things were. The room was well lit and nicely decorated and had ample storage space. We had a great time. We recommend staying here for Ashir's hospitality and the amazing location.

1209893,40756001,2015-08-02,759605,Cathy,We are former SF residents who returned for an extra long vacation (17 nights) this summer to visit friends and family.  We enjoyed Toni's  apartment very much.  Toni was very responsive and communicative throughout the planning and stay.  She is very thoughtful and left us information for easy reference.  The apartment is beautifully decorated with a very well equipped kitchen.  The neighborhood is great and very convenient for walking and public transportation.  I would definitely recommend this place to those looking for a comfortable central place in SF.  
4710280,150313938,2017-05-07,56233262,Jason,Sarah and Anthony's place is even better than it looks in the photos has incredible views from the living room and is in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood of SF. They were gracious hosts and were very easy to coordinate with. We would definitely stay here again next time we're in San Fran!
1740537,34620859,2015-06-10,4096166,Marina,The house is very very nice and is perfectly located near the J line and bus stops. The Dolores Mission park is one hill away and the area is full of great places to eat and shop. It was the perfect location for a perfect first visit to San Francisco.
14996188,200006224,2017-10-03,116404161,Le-Marie,"Einfach nur großartig!
Die Suite von Suzanne und Peter hat unsere 5 Tage in San Francisco perfekt gemacht. Es ist so wunderschön hier und die beiden sind einfach toll! 
Es ist sehr sauber wunderschön eingerichtet und die Terrasse lässt sich morgens super nutzen um den Kaffee in der Sonne zu trinken.
Ich würde diese Wohnung jedem Hotelzimmer vorziehen man fühlt sich wie zu Hause :-)  
Vielen Dank an Suzanne und Peter für die Unterstützung bei unserem Kamera Problem.
Und Danke für die schöne Zeit! 
Ganz liebe Grüße von Fabian und Le-Marie

Kevin was incredibly accommodating and made our stay very easy and comfortable. He and his wife even surprised us with a bottle of wine for our anniversary when we arrived! 

Their home is beautifully nestled against Mt. Davidson and the sound of the rustling trees makes it incredibly relaxing. The space itself is also beautiful with a lot of really nice touches throughout. We already miss it! It's also very private with it's own entrance on the side of the house.

It's a short walk to the Forest Hill Muni station and lots of busses close by as well. We had no problem getting around the city from their location using public transit and the occasional Uber.

I would highly recommend Kevin's cozy studio! A beautiful private peaceful place to stay with easy access to several parts of San Francisco!"

Vidhu was great at communicating all the detail timely and accurately.
Would stay again! "

3030653,312111054,2018-08-22,129067247,Jacquelyn,We really enjoyed our stay at Lindsay and Nicole's place! Check-in and communication were easy and quick. The place is the perfect size for 2. We really appreciated the small touches like tea energy bars and the binder that has local tips and places to eat at. They were very responsive and friendly and the place was very clean which is an absolute must for me! The neighborhood is pretty quiet so it's nice to end your day here. It's pretty close to a bunch of touristy places just a 10-15 min Uber ride out. If street parking is an issue there is a parking garage-16th and Hoff Garage-that you can park your car overnight just $22/night which is pretty good for SF. Definitely would recommend if you're staying in the SF area :)

4184406,448092504,2019-05-04,16129679,Lauren,Spacious. Perfect for business travel. I had a great stay at Brian's place and really enjoyed Tiko the cat! The only complication was figuring out how to unlock the front door on night #1.  Had the hosts not been right there (and as wonderfully responsive as they were) I may have been stuck outside for a bit. Overall a great stay in an awesome location.

This was my first time staying in someone's home and I had more than a few reservations but Peter's easy approach and open door policy made it seem like my home for a few days.  This home is between my two favorite neighborhoods (Castro/Mission) and a half block from public transport.  Perfect location and beautiful view!

16839867,407022089,2019-01-31,71565698,Jerry,I used to live in San Francisco so know how exceptional it is to be located 1/2 block in from the water in the Marina.  If you are interested in outdoor activities this location is paradise.  I also loved the studio apartment.  It is on the very top level with tons of windows and great light and access to a charming rooftop deck with great views all around.  I was entirely comfortable during my month stay.  Shelley is an excellent host highly responsive and flexible quickly addressing the few minor questions I had during the course of my visit.  Highly recommended.

22706387,400054182,2019-01-10,1390260,Julia,My stay at this Airbnb was just OK. The unit itself is clean and recently renovated. The building appears to be undergoing renovation currently so some floorboards and wall surfaces are missing in the entrance/hallway. My main issue was the lack of window coverings provided anywhere in the apartment. The bedroom faces a busy parking lot. People are coming and going all night long in vehicles and dragging trash cans around creating a lot of noise and activating motion sensor floodlights that shine directly into the bedroom. The flat is also located at an intersection of 2 busy roads with 2 bus stops right there so it's already very noisy from traffic. I am a light sleeper so this created a problem for me even with earplugs I could not get a good night's rest.
7054235,412901315,2019-02-16,238407302,Sarah,This is a really lovely place! Benjamin and his wife were super nice and hospitable. You are two blocks from the beach and it's absolutely beautiful! The room is clean and big and really comfortable. The only downside is that there is no TV but that wasn't an issue for me. There is so much to explore in the neighborhood I wasn't there long enough to sit and watch TV. I highly recommend this place!!!

The location is great really close to Hayes where there are lots of nice restaurants etc. The room is very comfortable and all amenities are provided for.

We would definitely recommend you stay with him if you are looking to visit San Francisco!
17925808,284596788,2018-07-01,56244597,Patrick,Liliana's place was clean comfortable and welcoming. The bedroom is a good size with a comfortable mattress plenty of storage and a pleasant view.  The shared spaces have a lived-in feel but were clean and comfortable. The location is great with frequent bus service to many parts of town  walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and nearby shops and restaurants (especially on Polk St.). It is quiet for being so close to downtown and main arterials except for the rare noise from neighbors. Liliana and her husband were welcoming and very kindly accommodated my late arrival. Liliana's welcoming and open personality helped me feel comfortable using the shared spaces and she checked-in from time-to-time to make sure that I had what I needed. I would very much recommend staying with Liliana.

We stayed in the master bedroom with the 3 beds and private bathroom. The room and private bathroom was very clean and spacious.  Igor was very accommodating and easygoing. We rented bikes for 24 hours and Igor offered for us to keep the bikes in his backyard overnight. You do not need a car when staying at Igor's house. There is a bus stop within 2-3 blocks. We took the bus and used Uber to get around.  We were very happy with our stay and enjoyed talking to both Igor and Dimitri. We would be happy to stay here again!

What we received in Carrie & Randy's "" Cottage SF "" was more like our own little-esque home: Beautiful hardwood floors everything one would need to cook with a comfy Queen sized bed direct -flat screen TV  views and privacy were among the basics all nestled in a hillside - canyon community in a real San Francisco neighborhood. Walk to Zagat rated eateries BART station and city MUNI transporation hubs. These digs are the kind of places that San Francisco's heart truly lurks in.

14948905,168605798,2017-07-09,8625306,Yakshi,We loved the location and the beautiful furnishings. Great place for a group of five or a family plenty of room. Ample bathroom space too!
5852066,239670730,2018-03-02,109380708,Anna,Couldn’t have found a better place to stay while visiting SF! The location was so perfect right next to Alamo square. The place was so nice and clean. Paul communicated very well and was a perfect host!
16219958,163085715,2017-06-23,112573071,Tori,Great location! Very easy to walk to downtown golden gate park and the Golden Gate Bridge!
18550910,263726694,2018-05-12,187013378,Pauline,Joe is a very responsive and thoughtful host who's place is very quiet and peaceful while being just steps away from shops bars eateries and public transport.  The photo's on the internet accurately represent his stylish and clean lodgings and best of all the bed was the most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept in.   I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Joe's place and I couldn't recommend his hospitality highly enough.
10769424,99749176,2016-09-05,65850814,Christian,We enjoyed our stay and Beth is very kind and supportive. She helped us with reservation for Restaurants and her recommendations for important sights were very helpful. It's a good home base to discover the City.

114401,202332757,2017-10-10,36565579,Charles,George's home is beautiful. Clean and conveniently located. George is very friendly and his cat is adorable. Very nice stay in SF!

4614763,74155189,2016-05-13,10389788,John & Willemijn,I arranged this apartment for my colleagues while we were in San Francisco for work. They loved the place and neighborhood it had all the required amenities and it was very clean. It was very convenient for a work visit because it has a little desk and it is very close to public transport (both BART and MUNI). Del was also very accommodating especially when there were some last minutes changes as in who of my colleagues was going to stay at the apartment and there were also some change mid way. I definitely recommend staying at this place and I would book this again. 
5904304,327449542,2018-09-23,76664304,Jeremias,Sebastian apartment is great extremely well located to walk through the most important places in the city surrounded by cool places to grab a bite or coffee and he and his girlfriend were really kind.
25356099,422999607,2019-03-12,26204567,Brandon,Sat was an awesome host! Her place was super clean and check in and out was really simple. Having a parking space was soooo nice! And she had thoughtful touches like local info and snacks ready for us. The three bedrooms and two baths were an incredible value. We had plenty of sleeping space. There’s no kitchen but there is a sort of kitchenette which was just fine for us. Definitely recommended if you don’t need to stay right in the heart of the city.
4720512,273026231,2018-06-04,59897353,Harleigh,Everything was exactly as pictured and super easily accessible. There were a lot of cute little restaurants and record shops nearby and all of the Ubers/Lyfts were decent prices no matter where we went. The house itself was super clean and very comfortable and I would definitely recommend staying here!
12562572,340110690,2018-10-22,59826640,Beth,Brad and Ray’s place is awesome! The neighborhood is cute and feels very safe. Their place was very clean and well stocked. They provided some breakfast foods snacks and even chocolate and wine which was a sweet touch. Highly recommend their place and would definitely stay there again!
2509236,406163601,2019-01-28,40006734,Corneliu,My stay at Sally’s was comfortable. The neighborhood is safe to walk around day or night. Plenty of parking if you have a car. It’s a 5 min walk to the KT muni line and about a 15-20 min walk to Whole Foods BART metro Trader Joe’s the mall etc. Very convenient. Sally or her son responded quickly to any request or issue that came up.
24063893,338532835,2018-10-19,20867424,Jennifer,We loved the apartment - super charming very clean with all the necessary amenities. The location is wonderful - we will definitely be recommending it to friends visiting San Francisco in the future!

Es necesario el coche para visitar los lugares emblemáticos de la ciudad.
Maria fue muy amable."

28803800,517701930,2019-08-25,178876642,Chad,Place served its purpose well. Beds are extremely comfortable. Still trying to figure out what year it is by the way. Having said that I was a bit confused as to why I had to share a bed with someone when I could have just pulled the extra bed out of the couch. Preference maybe? You be the judge. After long days of gallivanting around the town it was peaceful to come home and relax to the sounds of children playing in the bounce house above. Can’t say I didn’t want to join them although I did wonder how they got that bounce house up all those stairs.
4959980,77307943,2016-05-31,73683109,Juan,Everything was as advertised we booked this place on a last minute memorial day trip and it all worked out as planned. Thanks Tali.
18221524,146821485,2017-04-23,44875579,Peter,It's a nice location for getting to many different sites in San Francisco or for getting to public transportation (even used the Cable Car at Powell Street).  Bush is a little busy but the apartment is on the 4th floor (don't worry there is  there is an elevator with lots of charm) and so the apartment is quiet.  The neighbors are all very quiet. The apartment itself is functional and clean with a nice kitchen.  This is a great place for a single or couple (not for a family).
24376665,262114016,2018-05-07,3157743,Philipp,Place was as expected. Easy communication and really quick response. We really enjoyed out stay and would definitely stay again.

918341,333828973,2018-10-07,203750611,Eun Young,"Nice host and beautiful place!
동네는 시내에서 조금 떨어져 있어서 운전하는 분들에게 편리할 것 같다.
하지만 집이 넓고 너무 예뻐서 시내에서 떨어진 거리를 감수할 수 있을만큼 머무르는 동안 너무 좋았다. 관광을 포기하고 집에서 편히 쉬고싶을 정도로 좋았다."
4510968,75787728,2016-05-23,65843517,Cavan,We met Anna very briefly but she seemed like a very kind person. the apartment was very cozy and accommodating. It was perfectly located for those who want to see SF without being in the heart of the city. I definitely would return to this location. 
31888526,486516534,2019-07-12,12777521,Ricardo L.,Excellent place! Clean comfortable beautiful perfect!  Great communication little perfect touches.  Please do yourself a favor and stay here.

17501002,348423171,2018-11-13,28403249,Kenzie And Harrison,We had a few troubles on our trip and they were the perfect most helpful hosts to us. The place is very nice and clean and hosts were there to help us with whatever we needed
59381,502478123,2019-08-04,195456050,Braden,Amazing location and great host!
4607177,125590617,2017-01-06,5318057,Molly,When it comes to Airbnbs - this place is as good as it gets. As a warm and welcoming host Lindsay makes everything easy and awesome.  The location is central to some of San Francisco's top attractions -  with great urban hikes restaurants and cafes. I'll be dreaming about this place for a long time to come. 
1699390,450204906,2019-05-08,14087694,Esther,Very cozy room with super comfy bed. Natasha and Kai are lovely hosts very helpful and great resources for what to see and do. It's an excellent location being on the edge of the mission and two blocks from BART. Their home is relaxing and quiet at night.
18757990,187292083,2017-08-26,144188833,Daniel,Great experience. Location was amazing quiet residential area just a quick uber away from downtown. Aaron was great reached out during our stay and willing to help in case we needed anything. Room was very clean and the bathroom shower and heated floors was definitely a nice touch. Would stay here again when coming back into the city!
18904,33993494,2015-06-03,1667044,Pamela,Patrick was very friendly and his house is very tastefully decorated. He made us feel very welcome and was a terrific help explaining how to use public transport to go sightseeing in San Francisco. We loved his dog Fanny and felt very safe whilst we stayed with Patrick. There are some great inexpensive restaurants closeby and we enjoyed not only Patrick's company but also the other guests who were staying there during our visit. Patrick drove us to the airport when we left and we really appreciated all that he did for us throughout our stay. He is a great person to have as a host and we would both recommend Patricks house to fellow travellers.
2739477,200835891,2017-10-06,16474646,Amber,Brian's house is amazing and totally lives up to all the photos! We had such a great stay here the beds are so so comfortable and the decor is out of this world - the closest I've ever felt to living in a castle. Great location near to the bustle of Castrobut just a few blocks away so it's super peaceful at night and an easy walk to the mission and so much delicious food! Would definitely recommend staying here!
3759246,63762283,2016-02-26,59636170,Sheenal,David was really the best of what you can expect from an Air BnB host. He was polite prompt and hospitable. My boyfriend and I just needed a place to stay the night in the city and the location was excellent. The room was really well lit and accommodating and it was also really quiet. Awesome stay!
24163232,259880610,2018-05-02,187536111,Dan,The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
51557,1565216,2012-06-26,2031615,Natascha,Staying in Len's Studio was wonderful. When I arrived one of the friendly neighbors welcomed me and already told me how great the place is and he wasn't joking. When I came in I was surprised how big the flat actually is. I expected it to be much smaller. It's roomy and wonderfully decorated and when you look out of the living room window you see other Victorian houses. Living there - also so very close to Safeway (open 24/7) where you will find anything that you need  - you will believe that you're actually living there not just make believe others that you're NOT a tourist =)  He also has tons of books about San Francisco Maps and the like and even if you did not know what to do in that city you will know after flipping through them. Wifi TV everything was just as Len described and I will certainly try to stay at this place again when I travel to San Francisco again. PS: The other reviewers were right it's the best location ever :)

11338538,69850415,2016-04-14,732993,Sam,"Beautiful apartment! 3 floors of luxury. You are minutes away from Hayes Valley one of my favorite parts of the city. Either have a nice stroll or take a Lyft/Uber - it takes minutes. Alamo Square Park is very closer. Relax on the grass and see the Painted Ladies.
The apartment was absolutely excellent and the host was quick to communicate. We enjoyed the apartment so much that we would certainly stay here again. The apartment was clean had fast wifi and generally ticked all the boxes."
27665176,491073972,2019-07-19,40183606,Bassem,"Clive is a great host he gave us all the tips and tricks we needed to explore San Francisco. He also gave some historical background about the city and how it evolved with time. Clive's house is in Mission we rented 1 room the bathroom is shared with other people which made the price relatively less pricey from other places. The house was silent beds very comfortable. The house is around 15 to 20 min by car from the heart of SF.  We were 2 people so we split uber however the metro line is 7 min walk away from the home. Mission is a nice area mainly populated by Latins. Very close to the house there is' Phil's coffee which is a famous coffee shop in west bay as well as nice tacos shops and many other things. 
If you want to experience living in a Victorian house and a calm area in SF I would recommend this place."
11242172,148010375,2017-04-29,68056393,Andrea,La casa si trova in un ottima posizione l'unico problema la cucina in comune e gli odori forti di cucinato ma le stanze erano pulite. 
581216,113172682,2016-11-10,73137204,Teresa,We had an amazing holiday and Cathie was the perfect host extremely helpful and friendly.  The flat was perfect and situated so close to everything.  Will definately recommend to friends thank you.

The location was ideal for us having no car. Five minutes walk from the Bart and a good selection of food shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.
We would certainly recommend it."
27107519,477669664,2019-06-28,223157595,Toni,Location location location! Coffee shopping Dolores Park fantastic food The Castro... everything is right there. The space is beautifully appointed and clean. The outdoor terrace is relaxing after a long day-not to mention a hot tub for soaking! I would definitely stay here again.
4105892,108859703,2016-10-17,96448510,Lynsey,Free and easy access and my friend and I felt comfortable coming and going as we pleased.  Very eclectic and comfy outdoor sitting area with an A-typical property and great view of the city.  The park blocks are pretty with a nice cafe at the bottom of the hill and a short walk up the hill with walking paths from the property for a nearly 360 view. They have a gem in the city and are a gracious couple.
918341,8816479,2013-11-19,5921452,Jessica,This is an amazing place and little neighborhood! The apartment was spotless comfortable had all the amenities as well as extras that I appreciated-a few drinks in the fridge and tea. Transportation was nearby and the area itself was fun to explore with many great restaurants and shops. Kepa was a lovely host very responsive to my inquiries before arriving in SF and helpful when we were there-answering logistical questions and offering ideas of places to see. And the outdoor garden was a great space to sit out and read/relax in the morning. I would definitely stay here again on a trip to SF!
567239,5734816,2013-07-14,6742781,Jeffrey,"A quick trip to San Francisco on business followed by a quick scamper over to Davis. The Peaceful Noe Valley Refuge was convenient to buses light rail and BART. I was able to get downtown and anywhere I needed to be without worrying about renting a car.

I found the accommodations comfortable and quiet. The neighborhood has some very good restaurants as one would expect of San Francisco.
"
10393552,196305457,2017-09-22,25602813,Elizabeth,Jeff was quick to get back to us and answer our questions. The hotel is centrally located to just about everything you could want to do in San Fran. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was huge with a king size bed (which was hard to find in San Fran) and very clean. The top floor of the hotel has a club lounge where they have coffee and tea out all day. From 4-6pm they offer free wine and cheese for guests. The bar on the second floor was small but they offer happy hour twice a day with live jazz music. Even though this was a timeshare hotel no one ever asked us to buy or even listen to a presentation. We would love to stay here again on our next trip!
5616609,401964181,2019-01-16,9874586,Fran,Great host. Friendly couple. Response time is outstanding.
2349483,458166649,2019-05-25,250535490,Naisa,Staying with Frances and Dave was great. Both were so friendly as was their daughter and dog though he sometimes tries to trick you into thinking he’s a scary boy. The room and bathroom were both clean and tidy. I really appreciated the binder full of near by restaurants with hand written notes on why Frances and Dave liked the locations. The bathroom and room were well stocked with toiletries snacks coffee tea towels and the like. The bed was very soft. The backyard was beautiful with so many plants and flowers. The view from the back porch was a stunning look of downtown and the Bay Bridge. I really enjoyed my visit with Frances and Dave and will try to book with them again when I visit San Francisco next.
1752371,342895498,2018-10-29,29151667,Jessica,Rico's place was perfect for our weekend trip to San Francisco.  He was MORE than accommodating when I needed to drop my bags off early to return a rental car from my trip to Sonoma.  The neighborhood is beautiful with many restaurants/cafes and there was a street festival on the Sunday I was there which Rico made sure to tell me about.  The space was perfect and I enjoyed the outdoor patio as much as the indoor space.  What really stood out was his communication and the personal touches which express to me that he really cares about his guests.  I will definitely return and recommend to friends and family.
8524982,191475113,2017-09-07,59317041,Philippe,Sans problème  bel chambre + salle de bain  confortable et bien située avec quartier plein de restaurants pour le soir .
12987777,79019527,2016-06-10,11360953,Alexis,I had a great time at Sharon's apartment. The area was nice and quiet while also being a 5mns walk to a variety of bars and restaurants. The apartment itself was newly remodeled and clean.
2387068,99205436,2016-09-04,36423340,Clara,Peg is a really Nice person very hepfull and welcoming. She let a lot of privacy but she still available for any questions. Her house is beautiful and the room was perfect with a huge King size bed a Private bathroom. Her dog is very cute ans it s always Pleasant to see them. There is a bus Line very close to the house which Bring you in the Downtown in 20mn. The district is quiet but you have to love chinese food if you want to lunch outside. I recommand Peg's house to everyone

2396847,53741595,2015-11-12,25425249,Sarah,Absolutely loved staying at Yelena's! She was extremely nice and helpful and more than accommodating with checking in/out and having all of the necessary toiletries and household items you might need on hand. The apartment was in great condition and very clean (I am a bit of a neat freak and germaphobe so when I say clean I mean clean!) The location was very convenient to exploring San Fran and the surrounding areas and I was able to find parking nearby (either right in front or a short 2-3 minute walk away). I felt safe in this neighborhood and would definitely stay here again I will be planning my next visit to San Fran around staying in this apartment since everything was so perfect! Thanks again Yelena!

Highly recommend!
770991,170136918,2017-07-14,35890578,Susan,"Rose was a great communicator providing comprehensive responses to my questions and concerns prior to my arrival.
She greeted me once I'd settled a bit in the charming apartment and oriented me to the area and SF high points.  She also provided me with comprehensive transportation information which was invaluable.  Rose offered use of a clipper card and had stocked the fridge with milk water butter eggs homemade jam and artisanal bread - perfect!  I felt very comfortable and all my needs were met.  Thank you Rose and Sebastian.  A very nice experience "
27312503,358517095,2018-12-14,4122397,John,This apartment was fantastic! Right across the street from work. Spotlessly clean. Amazing views from the apartment and the rooftop. Good bath/shower good size bedroom and bathroom.

10347570,202746822,2017-10-12,45349881,Craig,"My girlfriend and I enjoyed our three night stay.

Vidhu was a great host. The loft was exactly as seen in the photos and the neighbourhood had everything We wanted. An easy uber to the sights or a short walk to a good selection of bars and restaurants on 24th.

An added perk was the parking. No 2 hour limits etc.  The only time to take note of the rules was for street cleaning days. 

All in all a great stay."
474107,338499393,2018-10-19,52508045,Tam,Ines is a lovely host everything we needed was provided. San Francisco is an expensive place so I was pleased to find this gem. It may not be in town but uber rides into the city centre are easy and cheap.
1110346,132905447,2017-02-19,12283842,Xia,Stella's room was every bit as beautiful as the photos. It is in a quiet well located neighbourhood that made it easy to see the sights of SF.  Stella gave us a warm welcome and we loves her cute dog named Bruno.We would return in an instant and completely enjoyed our stay. Many thanks!
1995487,68003935,2016-04-01,11480382,James,From the initial checkin to the moment we departed our stay was superb. Stellar amenities with a spectacular view of downtown SF and a view of Oakland Bridge. Amble supply of fresh towels linens and toiletries. Conveniently located near the mission and castro district that support several eateries and nightlife. Thank you for a memorable stay!
10058568,74893378,2016-05-17,827174,Paul,"We had a wonderful time staying at Ryan's house in Cole Valley for a month. The pictures don't do it justice as the scale and ceiling height of each room is immense. 
Ryan was always helpful and quick to address any minor issues. The area is lovely and gives you a true experience of life in the pretty Victorian homes and areas of central SF. Access to the Golden Gate park Haight Mission Castro and even Hayes Valley areas is possible by foot or quick taxi. Cole Valley itself is a little gem of a village. So close to Haight but very different with great bars and restaurants plus a number of useful shops for locals. The metro line passing through it makes it all the more perfect. I'm not sure I would want to stay anywhere else. 
The deck at the back of the home is large and very pretty surrounded by a canopy of trees and some amazing succulent plants. Most mornings the sun fills it and streams into the kitchen which gets heated beautifully even when outside might be a bit cold.
Since we stayed a month we loved using the big screen TV and catching up on a few box sets via Netflix etc. In the evenings the sun streams into the front reception room and you can watch it set over the skyline - which even provides a glimpse of the top of the Golden Gate Bridge.
In the interests of balance the only thing we can mention that wasn't quite perfect was the beds - not quite as comfy as we'd like especially in the small bedroom which has a foldout metal bed and thin mattress. Nothing else was more than a minor quirk though so we highly recommend Ryan's home."
44032,1822987,2012-07-28,2959891,Fiona,Had a lovely stay at the secret lounge. David went out of his way to pre arrange check in earlier than required time. We arrived in the city in the morning so we were able to drop off our bags. The location was very clean and had everything we needed. There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance that for dine in or take out. Short walk to the train station as well. Would stay here again.

10455995,280652493,2018-06-23,9119811,Terry,This is a home away from home. Located on the quietest street in SF (we have stayed to 6 different neighborhoods in the city) with an incredible view of downtown and East Bay. Sarah and Mark were attentive hosts answering any questions we had about the local area. Lots of cute cafes in Potrero Hill and Dogpatch (very close). Two markets within a block make it easy to pick up coffee/snacks for the house. The location is at the top of a hill so be prepared to walk a few blocks (usually) to the buses. The 10 and 22 will take you non-stop to most places you will want to visit as a first-timer. It's an easy walk to Giants Stadium...all flat! Of all the places we have stayed in SF this has been our favorite...thanks again!
8859249,151032064,2017-05-10,23024210,Ken,Great stay here! A cozy place to stay near the bus line and a short walk to the MUNI station! It is located next to a busy road so be ready for a little bit of road noise at night if you go to bed earlier.  We used a white noise app on our phone and it was fine.  This place has everything we needed and Gary and Erika were super fast in responding to our requests.  Would totally stay here again. Clean and cozy!
8472927,107495708,2016-10-10,36208659,Noelle,Excellent communication.  A perfect nest in a safe beautiful neighborhood. :)

56621,19121604,2014-09-07,5686074,Chiyoko,I stayed at Jay’s house for 7 nights.  I enjoyed her place very much.  It’s close to everywhere I wanted to go to and less than a block away from Lafayette park which has a gorgeous view of the Bay.  I really enjoyed the sun-set view from there.  It is situated in a nice safe area.  The house is overall kept clean but not OCD clean.  I enjoyed socializing with other guests in the kitchen.  I felt a little unsafe about the sliding doors which didn’t have a lock.  But Jay was careful about having right guests (most of whom were interns and working professionals) and so I had no trouble at all.  I would definitely stay at her place again.    
17271591,158824063,2017-06-08,84575348,Abby,My husband and I loved our stay here! It is in a central location and is walking distance from most of the places we want to see! We loved the view from the living room and the roof top terrace! We'd love to come back again someday! 
568161,7889500,2013-10-07,8883438,Kathryn,Staying with Beth and her family was my first experience with airbnb and it was a delightful one. I was welcomed by this gracious family in their sunny quiet and comfortable home The neighborhood is quiet yet just blocks away from a great market numerous coffee shops and BART; all this and no extra parking fees.  As my daughter is a student at the University of San Francisco I will be visiting the area many times over the next several years.  With this experience as my reference point it is likely I will  never stay in a hotel in the City again.  
162934,556177185,2019-10-28,21127688,Kira,I have stayed at Noelle's twice and love it. Its the perfect quiet cozy cave in a great location with an amazing shower! I sleep so deep every time here.
5581254,42662534,2015-08-15,31480655,Cecile,Kesinees apartment is conveniently located public transport is just around the corner. It is perfect for two and okay for four visitors. Kesinee gave us a warm welcome and gave us lots of tips about places to visit. We enjoyed our stay!! Their dog is great!!!
1556680,218288119,2017-12-11,12755601,TirzahJoy,We loved our time there and it fit the 8 of us well- David left another mattress out for our use and all of our kids had a place to sleep. We loved the layout and had more than enough toys and cozy socks to last the trip!
4305042,230714332,2018-01-28,86579901,Elyzza,We had a pleasant stay at this upscale beautiful place. The view is amazing! Mel is a wonderful host! His responses were quick and he was very accommodating. Parking is limited since the home is located on a steep hill with a very narrow road but Mel reserved a parking spot for us in front of their home. We were pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of champagne and glasses waiting for us in the fridge. Their lovely place and superb hospitality made our anniversary weekend truly unforgettable.
22325337,556515042,2019-10-29,116267856,Rebecca,Neils place is really close to everything but without all the road noise that comes with being by a big city! Parking at night can be hard to find if you go out but during the day it’s easy. I would bnb from here again!
5572169,541095233,2019-10-04,20165484,Lindsay,Awesome place in a great location. Clean cute and comes with a great host! Lots of recommendations and quick responses. Would gladly stay again!

8904047,57921993,2015-12-30,6013550,Lindsey,We had nice stay at Amy's place. It was very easy to check in and was in a really great neighborhood in walking distance to a lot of great food bars shopping and public transportation. Our only issue was it was a bit noisy with the folks upstairs in the morning. (But we are not early risers.) But otherwise-- great spot!
8685766,74456511,2016-05-15,34407034,Michael,The experience was superb. The hotel had a nice atmosphere. The rooms were small but very modern. Very minimalistic which was all we needed.
1053666,95660023,2016-08-20,4431072,Peter,This place was exactly as depicted on the site. It was very comfortable spacious and clean. Even though there isn't a kitchen it's not necessary because there are great restaurants coffee shops and grocery stores right nearby. The apartment is in a great location central but quiet. I was amazed how quiet it was for being on the first floor. Lilu and Neil were great hosts as well. I forgot my keys one night and texted them the were there immediately to let me back in. Overall I had a great stay. 
593253,454648427,2019-05-18,59804316,Robert,I enjoyed my stay very much.  The bedroom was spacious and the location is perfect for exploring the city.
4013746,146118847,2017-04-21,11709691,Leonid,Great accommodations in a quiet neighborhood within 20 minutes commute to the center of San Francisco. The hosts are wonderful and always respond to inquiries within minutes on Airbnb. 
1433917,10531496,2014-02-24,7188392,Lori,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Mick and Barbara in their beautiful Castro apartment.  The apartment was well appointed comfortable and spacious and the kitchen was far better equipped than my own---it even had an espresso maker!  Our hosts left us a lovely basket of goodies beer in the fridge a bottle of wine and a pantry full of spices oil and other cooking basics.  We'll definitely stay here again!  
1673011,278808914,2018-06-18,15981733,Grant,A spacious beautiful home. A world class view and location. 
2349483,102080540,2016-09-16,80087730,Sandra,Frances was a warm and welcoming host. Open to help with anything we needed and advice on the trip. The room was pleasant and quiet with a comfortable bed. She gave us plenty of suggestions for restaurants nearby. The location isn't central however we liked it because it felt like true San Fran. The easiest way we found to get around from here is by uber which was cheaper than public transport if you are a couple travelling around. 
9449061,74420202,2016-05-15,4719988,David,A very nice apartment in a superb area of San Francisco. Easy to access all the sightseeing spots.
3394127,128149333,2017-01-22,77298092,Catherine,Andrew's place was wonderful to stay in and well taken care of. Even while traveling himself Andrew was very responsive and helpful during the duration of my stay. The feline companion in the studio was also very welcoming and a great companion for my visit to SF for work.
8739,7619111,2013-09-27,6810620,Ann,"A lovely place to stay in the Mission district. Ivan and Wendy are such gracious hosts they even provided a pack n play for my daughter. My sister and I are happy to have found their home since it's so close to all the eateries and shops we wanted to visit. (we had breakfast at Tartine twice! ) Thanks Ivan and Wendy!

"
16219958,338173334,2018-10-18,124996,Valerie,"Perfect spot to explore the city rest and discover new sweets in little Russia. Igor was a wonderful and thoughtful host everthing was sparkling clean breakfast was lovely!  (Note: if  you have mobility issues there are lots of stairs but perfect otherwise! ) 
Would love to visit again!"
8859249,120461273,2016-12-10,12539998,Leila,"Although we never met Erika and Gary they were very nice and checked in every day to make sure we did not need anything (and to provide suggestions regarding what to do on a rainy day!). The apartment is accessed through their backyard through a private staircase. It's a sweet little place beautifully furnished and clean with great light. Occasionally we heard their children but that didn't bother us at all. There is a cute deck although it's impossible to use in the rain! 

The location is great if you want to explore Golden Gate Park or Ocean Beach (which be forewarned is currently closed for some reason). It's a bit far away from shops and restaurants but you can take the N train down Judah St. to get to these provided you have a pass. It's probably about a 2 mile walk from those community areas which is fine if you have nice weather (we didn't really). "
10321776,126802285,2017-01-14,4055969,Melissa,"This was the perfect place to stay for a week in SF. Ocean Beach is beautiful and quiet while still being central to the city. 

The apartment was extremely comfortable and well stocked with toiletries and basic kitchen items. Having a refrigerator was also very useful.

Arpita was a great host and checked in to make sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. She also provided tons of great suggestions for activities and restaurants around the neighborhood. It couldn't have been a better stay!"
1104362,60453962,2016-01-24,47267656,Lex,Good accurate listing and the host offered assistance (via email) but also stayed out of the way (I'm shy and prefer to handle things myself).    Nice clean beautiful apartment with a super-comfy bed.  Pro tip: press the shower dial inward while turning to get an actually warm shower.  Great location.  Late travelers: check out Orphan Andy's for 24/7 diner-style food.  
9347891,332170375,2018-10-04,180176236,Lynne,Our first experience of using air BnB and very lucky to use this lovely apartment. Chris always very quick to respond to messages apartment immaculately clean and comfortable with thoughtful extra touches of tea coffee milk and breakfast things. Quiet residential area. Safeway’s a 5 min walk away and 10-15 mins to places to eat. A great retreat after a hectic day seeing the sights of San Francisco.
23185870,240727167,2018-03-05,82195809,Dhani,Mary's place is conveniently located in walking distance to the Mission District - strong art & culture scene and many great restaurants. The house is located on a quiet street with cafes and corner stores a few feet away. Mary is quick to respond to questions and/or concerns. Her place has a gorgeous view and is very nicely decorated. We enjoyed our stay very much!
238190,6396223,2013-08-11,6468716,Sang-Ho,I stayed at Bill's place over the summer for about 2 months and it was a great experience. This was my first time truly living on my own and I'm glad that Bill was able to make this an easy transition for me. The location is great and right by Fisherman's Wharf Russian Hill and North Beach. The public transportation goes really close to his apartment too and can take you most places in the city. His apartment is clean and very nice and he has two great kids that are there about half the time. Really fast internet too which was great for me to stream videos and play games. Overall a great experience and a thank Bill for an awesome summer. 
7697503,490526157,2019-07-18,272068512,Eduardo,Estupendo.
241235,23998143,2014-12-16,22930817,Evan,The best location for all the awesome spots near downtown SF.  Hosts make it a point to help with bags give thorough rundowns and even go out of their way to include everyone in community fun! Even though I slept right outside the common area (2 floor setup) it was surprisingly quiet and the hostel inhabitants more or less stuck to the established hours. Very inviting for youthful travelers with budgets in the big city.
17982304,519541141,2019-08-28,49207654,Matthew,"What to say?

I chose this place for a short stay for my mum and myself.  My mum had the bedroom while I took the sofa bed in the lounge.

The place is roomy - in many large cities it would be the size of an entire apartment.  It would easily accommodate two couples.  There’s ample storage a well laid out kitchen and very pleasant patio available for guest use.  The bathroom is not huge but is adequate enough and well presented - crucially water pressure is very good - it’s amazing how a weak shower can spoil your stay somewhere.

The location is truly excellent.  It’s on a quiet residential street just a five minute walk - on a very gentle gradient - from the centre of the Castro.  It’s ideally located for anyone who wants to visit San Francisco.  Whether for a guest who has concerns about mobility around San Francisco’s steep streets - turn right out of the house and the short walk to the Castro is not steep at all.  Or whether a guest is interested in hill walking or running - turn left out the house and you’ve got a steep climb right there.  It’s just the right location.  Presentation is also excellent - all appointments have clearly been chosen with care.

My overall feeling about the place is that if I were visiting alone it’s the kind of place one might retreat to if writing a novel.  In a quiet spot in a nice clean neighbourhood a few minutes walk from the noise.  Good sized supermarket and restaurants all within an easy walk and the F Tram right there to take you down Market St to downtown.

Our hosts were unobtrusive and offered any help needed if we had any questions which were few.  They’ve pretty much got all the bases covered here.  We had a terrific stay."
9063798,563714495,2019-11-13,123826134,Vyacheslav,Nice place to stay thank you very much!
997382,127043824,2017-01-15,23468019,Stefan,Location was ideal. Access to the house was made easy via codes on all the doors which is great so you don't loose the key! Parking was very difficult (it's SF expected) but I parked nearby in a lot which was recommended by Josh via his first email which was nice as a traveler to keep my goods semi-safe and still be close by. His communication was excellent - for the price and location I'd recommend it to the minimalist solo traveler who isn't to picky. 
4105958,30243313,2015-04-19,989481,Ken,Paul and his wife were very hospitable taking time to make sure everything went smoothly. The inclusion of snacks and a bottle of wine was a pleasant surprise and the apartment itself was very comfortable and conveniently located. I would definitely recommend staying there.

28009722,476700547,2019-06-26,5215461,Snow,Nancy’s place is truly a gem. Short walk to public transports restaurants cafes and many attractions. Checking in and out were very smooth. Nancy responded quickly when I asked her something. The studio itself was amazing. You have everything you need there. Bed was super comfy! Will definitely stay there again when I am in SF next time! Thank you!
17301795,210677013,2017-11-10,146021699,Staci,The house was really nice and very spacious the neighbors really sweet & the neighborhood was safe.  We had a few small issues but the host was really easy to work with.
1483853,25400123,2015-01-14,25892857,Walter,Great stay. Picture is very accurate to reality. Modern style very clean and relatively new furnishings. There was even a tv embedded in the bathroom mirror. Good sized room for a San Francisco hotel. Perfect location just 1 block away from union square. Will definitely stay again in the future.
2188976,19975957,2014-09-21,6203385,Kali,Jason was a very welcoming host - provided many recommendations on local restaurants and methods of transportation. Was very accommodating with our schedule. Listing was as described. Convenient location in the Mission District.

7902505,53902617,2015-11-14,21256667,Laylee,Sarah's studio apartment was a great spot for my company's remote Team Member visiting from San Diego. He really appreciated the Netflix breakfast snacks and fast WiFi (he said the bottle of vino didn't hurt either)! He definitely would stay there again! 
8382187,300274299,2018-08-01,192565184,Angelo,"My wife and I stayed 2 nights at Ludmela's ""in law"" suite and it was PERFECT! Ludmela let us check in early so we could drop our bags off (super nice)  and then we could walk to the beaches pacific ocean and the golden gate bridge. The location was my favorite part. We got to talk to Ludmela and her mother who were very nice! The place even had a nice backyard to sit and enjoy! If we go back to San Francisco we will try to stay here again! "
3612236,31725057,2015-05-09,30860109,Kenneth,"Looking for a decently priced place to stay in San Fran at the peak travelling time was pretty tough especially since it had to be centrally located due to the fact that we did not have a car for our trip. Luckily I came across Jordan's listing here because it couldn't have gone more perfectly. 

Even though I couldn't reach Jordan personally after numerous emails once I got confirmed I just (Hidden by Airbnb) d the address found a website and emailed to see if I was confirmed for the time I had booked and that was extremely easy. 

The area is right smack in the middle of Union Square  extremely close to the Powell BART Powell Cable Car turnaround and tons of buses to take you all over the city. The place itself is small and very old school with the room being very simple. Decently comfortable bed good sized mini fridge clean en-suite washroom. It's not luxurious at all but a very comfortable place to lay your head and relax before/after a long day around town. 

If you don't have a car like us then I'd highly recommend this spot we got around so easily due to all the transit that surrounds the area.  There are also tons of places to eat within steps I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
148769,147614457,2017-04-27,87693363,Rey,Great location and everything you need for a stay in the city! I will definitely try to book with mark again
1556680,271958782,2018-06-02,154765559,Carole,"David’s place was a great base for exploring all San Francisco has to offer. Ocean beach and golden gate park are within easy walking distance as are a great children’s playground supermarket and a variety of eating places. 
We caught the bus into the city which took about 40 minutes and cost $2.75 the bus stop was less than a 5 minute walk. 
The apartment itself was clean well stocked and quiet. 
David always responded promptly to any communication and was always polite and helpful. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
34946905,567547248,2019-11-22,296177968,Miri,We had a great stay with Joshin ... Excellent hospitality!
1992217,25287458,2015-01-11,1038143,Wolfgang,Very easy to communicate completely hassle-free. Great place as advertised with all the amenities you could possibly need (shampoo hair dryer lots of towels....). Excellent location and clean apartment. And to top it all off: a great host. I know I'll be back :)
21026079,568706465,2019-11-24,95584213,Paul,Your best option for a true SF experience. This place is a magnet for wanderers (including those of the world heart and/or mind) Plenty of interaction with like minded travelers + staff but plenty of space to be alone if that's your thing. The space itself is a reflection of this creative spirit full of dissonant surprises sprinkled throughout. If you're looking for a high end experience this isn't it. If you're looking for a memorable experience with great similarly minded people in a very cool venue then this certainly is it!
12999869,326227000,2018-09-21,74241067,Ryan,I was in SF for a week on business. I wanted to stay somewhere quiet clean and with easy access to different parts of the city. Sarah and Pankaj’s place exceeded my expectations! I slept like a king got some work done and ate each evening in a lovely living space and even enjoyed a delicious dinner with Sarah and Pankaj one night. Both were consistently available to help me navigate the city but also gave me space to wind down and relax each day. The home itself is a stylistic masterpiece; really elegant yet subtle modern touches. And if there was construction nearby I never heard it. The surrounding neighborhood is very clean upscale and has some great local food spots. Finally the view of the sunset from the living room was the perfect way to end each day. I walked to and from work each day and I’ll definitely be staying here next time I’m in town.

1919372,37526408,2015-07-07,37198405,Andrea,"This space was absolutely charming! Located in what we came to recognize as one of the most coveted neighborhoods in San Francisco the convenience of this tasteful studio was immeasurable. My fiancé and I were first-time visitors to both San Francisco and California and we were able to have immediate access popular spots such as Nopa; which is a fantastic restaurant that has been labeled an absolute must for an exquisitely creative taste of San Francisco dining.
The building housing the flat was gorgeous and pristine and the interior decor did not disappoint. Ladies if you are traveling with a partner you will truly appreciate the bright airy and spacious bathroom! Flowers artfully placed throughout the studio veritably enhanced the romantic air in this jewel-toned space.
Essentially every word you've read in the multitude of previous positive reviews of Art's beautiful studio is correct! I highly recommend this space and will definitely be booking again soon!"
1434314,14914622,2014-06-29,570908,Stef,"This is a 6 star place! It's stylish very comfortable and a jacuzzi on the terrace with views over SF makes it really stand apart. We loved the espresso machine and complimentary beans made us really feel at home :) 
The kitchen has a lot of gear and was stocked with spices and oils.  
Beds are comfy and the street is very quite at night so well suited for a good night's rest. 
Alex is a superb host early arrival was no problem at all we received a warm welcome and he gave thoughtful tips prior to our stay as well as superfast answers on the questions we had. "
24463,565770504,2019-11-17,156664485,Leigh Ann,Wonderful host welcomed us into this lovely and comfortable place atop an attractive neighborhood. Spectacular views make it well worth the steep climbs you experience in this part of San Francisco. We would gladly stay here again.
1104912,281438892,2018-06-24,139282065,Amy,Chani’s place was easy to access and a great find in a city with very expensive options. Right up the street from the beach you experience a quiet neighborhood with easy access to other neighborhoods in the city.
20852769,210495287,2017-11-09,35168765,Nina,The place was great. I will say it was a bit cold but I realized a window was open and the host was super responsive to share how to adjust the heat and access the wifi when I asked.

794626,353395282,2018-11-27,120605507,Jamie Lee Maria,This was a very great apartment. Great location and very clean. Plenty of space for us. I wish the owner would have warned us about the loud construction and loud children that started at 7 am but other then that we had an amazing stay.
4959980,36217010,2015-06-26,17009124,Chris,She was there on time very nice and everything looked good.
27598470,500175948,2019-08-01,18725702,Anand,"My friends and I stayed here and it was about what we expected. It was a nice place for us to stay for two nights and check-in and check-out were very easy thanks to the lockbox.

George provided very clear instructions / tips about the home so we didn't really have any questions or issues whatsoever. One final thing that I really appreciated was on the day-of George reached out to ask if he should set up the sofa bed for us before we arrived which was really nice since we arrived late!"
6653474,448030745,2019-05-04,129697732,Luca,The space was exactly as advertised and we had a great time at Ari's apartment. Recommended!
1511076,51045635,2015-10-17,44439557,Ben,"Jefferson and Gary were wonderful hosts!  They greeted us showed us the lay of the land and provided a huge list of things we could do while we were in the city.  My traveling companion and I were never at the house much but when we were it was a beautiful oasis to retreat to.  The decor in the house is phenomenal each day i noticed new little pieces of art that I had overlooked the day before.  

We took a red-eye flight home and Jefferson worked with us to ensure we could pick our bags up before we headed out without having to lug them around with us all day.  I would highly recommend that others stay with Jefferson and Gary!"
7844031,237136324,2018-02-21,9857476,Matt,I’ve stayed at Barry’s spot a couple of times and it’s perfect. The location is central. The home is spotless. The bed is comfortable and Barry is an awesome host!
14268636,231762451,2018-02-02,49825869,Andrew,Staying with Julian was awesome. He had eggs in the fridge for all of his guests for breakfast and the room was super stylish + clean. Also went out of his way to help me secure a parking spot the night I came in! We chatted about tech for a while as well which was fun. You won’t find a better host.

able to find free parking on the streets! A great first air bnb experience!! "
229240,250960871,2018-04-06,131310354,Ranae,Good place for a quick short stay even for us older folks. The entry stairs are long but the staff person came down to carry my bags up without my asking. The room was quite quiet even with eight occupied bank beds. You need to be able to get into a top bunk.
21730649,464924702,2019-06-06,245839215,Jessica,El alojamiento de Alex es perfecto si vas a hospedarte una o dos noches. Las camas son muy cómodas y las duchas funcionan a la perfección. Está un poco alejado del transporte público y no hay supermercados cerca. Es ideal si se tiene locomoción propia. Se encuentra en un buen punto ya que está cerca del puente y del parque.
22487945,291379954,2018-07-15,178084237,Brandon,Great spot! Cheap Ubers to downtown and financial district. Very clean

189068,2648924,2012-10-18,3543037,Tiffany,Kingmond and Mary were wonderful hosts during our ten day stay in San Francisco we felt right at home with them. Breakfast was delicious and there is really beautiful sunlight in the morning. For yoga practitioners there is excellent floor space in the living room with a full-size mirror if you want to keep up your practice during your travels. Taxi to symphony hall is around $20 and buses to the BART are right at the door. Must visit Kingmond's photography studio downstairs a lot of admirable work to see.

10889831,288403120,2018-07-09,43523504,Helen,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Danna’s place.

The room is large and cozy the bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is conveniently located right next to the bedroom. The house also has a lovely sunny balcony and a cute backyard.

The house is located in a quiet residential area just a 5 min drive from Twin Peaks with magnificent views of the city. There are several cafes and restaurants in walking distance. However a car would be useful for sightseeing. 

Danna is also an absolutely wonderful host. She was very friendly social and helpful. As a bonus her two cats are delightfully curious and playful :)"
3183280,15879647,2014-07-17,11403946,Renee,Aruna is so helpful and accommodating. Her place is amazing and centrally located. I would definitely rent this airbnb again. Everything was perfect!
18126981,270317291,2018-05-28,13150174,Elizabeth,Great price. If you plan on spending very little time at the Airbnb this is perfect. A more expensive option may be preferable if you’re looking for a cozy place to relax and spend your evenings. 
859336,134534347,2017-02-27,42884709,Danielle & Shaun,Great location in San Fran. Walking distance for breaky/ coffee spots restaurants and bars. Short uber ride to fishermans wharf and Golden Gate Bridge. Clean place and very spacious! Perfect host thanks Anka!

21217809,311250975,2018-08-20,130428980,Lindsay,Kim and the fellow co-hosts of the air bnb were so friendly and offered my boyfriend and I such a comfortable clean and charming place to stay while traveling around San Francisco for the first time. The location is great for staying near the city with the perks of a more affordable price. I am more than satisfied with my stay at Kim’s and I would stay here again in the future. 
1421774,412100447,2019-02-14,25703497,Kathryn,Amazing space filled with lovely personal touches and a wonderful location. The bed was amazingly comfy the bathroom felt like a spa. Would certainly stay here again!

16305055,172724604,2017-07-21,45577608,Christian,"Angenehme Unterkunft  400m bis zum Tram das direkt ins Herz von St Francisco fährt...auch nachts und mit dem Muni-ticket.
 Im kleinen Garten haben wir sogar Opossum gesehen Kolibri und andere Vögel. Golden Gate Bridge mit Velo in 1h erreichbar. Der Ocean  in 15 Min. Zu Fuss! Ebenso der Zoo...Einkauf und essen  auch spät möglich. Gerne wieder! "
20799337,495919859,2019-07-26,8872499,Christine,"This is a good apartment made great by the host's hospitality and attention to detail. The apartment is roomy and clean. The bed is comfortable and the sitting area (which also has a cleverly concealed Murphy bed) is also roomy and pleasant for relaxing and watching TV. But what really sets this place apart are the many thoughtful little touches from the host. Multiple charging stations around the apartment featuring all different types of connectors a full coffee and tea selection candies by the bed snacks by the TV floor fans for air and white noise nightlight in the bathroom and detailed notes all over the place that make everything very easy to navigate. Communication is very prompt and complete. 

Thank you for an easy and hospitable stay Charles!"
8500048,255520555,2018-04-20,63812208,Madeline,This place was awesome! It has a super efficient layout and mid century modern look. Brandi was really easy and quick to communicate with which made us feel welcomed and right at home. I would definitely recommend anyone traveling as a couple or with a friend to stay here.
15486470,252698231,2018-04-11,64607122,Nicholas,A comfortable and stylish apartment with great period details and a helpful and responsive host. We loved the shops and restaurants a block away but the apartment was quiet particularly the two rooms in the back. We loved our 3 night stay thank you Suzanne.
3716504,425730337,2019-03-18,19997662,Kate,I stayed only one night but Nancy was a great host with a very interesting home.
2356554,369216511,2019-01-09,2215288,Casey,I stayed at Tatiana's while in SF for work. Great place super private on a quiet street. It was clean and stocked with everything you'd need. Tatiana is a thoughtful communicative host. Highly recommend.

Thank you we had a great time"
22563498,247489532,2018-03-28,28783823,Ashley,"Jenny went above and beyond during my stay here! Even though I only came for a single night for business purposes Jenny's hospitality was impeccable. She was extremely flexible with my late check in and gave me a brief tour of her lovely home. The room is better than the pictures; lots of natural lighting an extremely comfortable and spacious bed plush carpets (and slippers!) for the floor and large closet for extra space. Bathroom was extremely clean speedy wifi and great location. On my last day she invited her airbnb guests to dinner and wine that she bought for us! Amazing conversations and overall a true communal airbnb experience. 

Side note: she also has two lovely dogs - they're sweet but just a heads up if you have any dog allergies or whatnot."
77175,109001444,2016-10-18,91758046,Jochen,Gorgeous place to stay in San Francisco. Easy access to the BART. The infos of Tyler were very useful. It was a beautiful and heartily time for us. 
992913,31566805,2015-05-07,24678801,Timac,The location of the place is perfect and easy to explore the city through bus cable car or walking. Gregory was a very friendly host and provided some good tips for us to visit the city.
10251,3217571,2013-01-02,2267039,Cye Matthews,The apartment was a clean and spacious place to stay for a few days for our family of five.  It is convenient to public transportation and restaurants.

Un sejour bien trop court en leur compagnie pour ma part  manque de temps... Je recommande ces hôtes les yeux fermés !

The neighbourhood had lots of choices from cheap and fresh to hip and fancy. Steps away from transport. Rafael and Mark were friendly kind and knowledgeable. R helped me with my bags and Mark provided great coffee! Thanks guys!

6423158,194362032,2017-09-16,132199107,Ruth,Alice's place is spacious - it has a kitchen with a washer and dryer; and a big room with a bed a couch that converts to a bed and a small dining area. Both of the beds were very comfortable. It is in a quiet neighborhood that is a short ride to downtown San Francisco and is easily accessible via Uber or public transportation. After exploring the busy city it was nice to come back to a nice quiet place and relax. Alice was a great host she responds to any airbnb inquiries immediately and was very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again if I ever make it back to San Francisco.
14938407,282237494,2018-06-26,175777449,Katie,"This was a great location near Bart in Daly City. It was clean and spacious. It felt like a hostel. Nice large communal living room attached to kitchen on the second floor. Kitchen was stocked nicely with utensils plates appliances communal refrigerator and even a small cabinet with some food to share (dried pasta canned food etc). 
Parking is available on a first come first serve basis with 3 spots right out front. There are a lot of rooms in the house but we parked nearby on an adjacent street overnight with no problems and it was only 1 block away. 
Although we didn’t use Bart it is about 2-3 blocks away less than a 10 minute walk. 
Victor was a great host and came to check in on the guests while we were arriving. Very quick to respond. 
Loved it and would stay again. Thank you Victor!"
1059961,25452566,2015-01-16,8854877,Shankar,"Laura and David were excellent and welcoming hosts. They communicated often ahead of the stay and made sure they were home when I arrived to help me with the lay out of the apartment and the facilities. 
They have an adorable dog Chelsea and David was kind enough to keep her engaged with treats to make sure she was comfortable with me there. 
The room was comfortable and clean and plenty spacious for one person. the bath room was also very clean and comfortable. 
Overall I had a very comfortable stay and would have no hesitation in recommending KelSoMA. "

15383658,532955942,2019-09-20,33661895,Trace,The location was absolutely perfect - my favorite restaurants in the same block. If you want a stylish fabulously decorated place - in the heart of “real” San Francisco - this is it.   Perfect for the business traveler.
1511076,136592511,2017-03-11,15790450,Erin,We loved staying with Jefferson & Gary! Their place is super comfy with a really awesome art collection. They could not have been nicer or more welcoming. We would happily stay with them again!

The neighborhood is very nice and quite; the Alamo Square is just next door with a beautiful view on the city. Also the Golden Gate Park is in walking distance. We highly recommend this place; we stayed here for business and could rest appropriately!!
11023703,78607216,2016-06-07,47699213,Maren,"We had a great stay!The Studio was cleanand we had everything we need.
You need definetly a car to come around."
220418,170126990,2017-07-14,129114627,Andrew,Beautiful home with awesome character. Close to great spots including Haight and Ashbury obviously Golden gate Park the painted Ladies etc. Every Uber we took was under $10 to anywhere further out. If you are on the third floor like we were hope your bags aren't too heavy as it's quite the hike lol. Cool place would stay again.
33578,138405427,2017-03-19,39284717,Justin,My wife and I really enjoyed staying at kepas place it had a real homestead vibe. She is very nice if you get a chance to talk to her and can tell you what's good in the neighborhood.

5376278,200006543,2017-10-03,7520904,Imene,L'emplacement est parfait. Les transports publics sont très proches. On peut facilement se rendre au downtown ou partout ailleurs avec le MUNI pass. L'appartement est très joli très artistique. La cuisine et le salon sont spacieux. Sahar était très serviable et accueillante. On s'est senti comme chez nous. Excellent rapport qualité prix. J'y reviendrais sans hésitation !
21693492,564862043,2019-11-16,287669656,Jenny,Loved this stay! Such a unique place with a very interesting background. Would definitely come back in a heart beat.

12025717,365855429,2019-01-01,2450533,Constance,We were a family of five grandma parents and two boys 9 and 12 who enjoyed our stay at Vlad and Ira’s. There were two day beds with a trundle for one in the living room and one bedroom and bath. The only inconvenience was that the bathroom is inside the bedroom. The cosiness of the space otherwise worked well and we appreciated the snacks and the condiments left for us. Our hosts gave us great dining suggestions.
4718629,275805085,2018-06-11,141329032,Annika,"Josh is a great host. 
Nice place. Super close by the beach and easy to get to the Bay Area  with the L line.

The had great recommendations for spots on the neighbourhood and the location is very central it was ideal for getting around the city. Would definitely stay there again! 
9188845,106702076,2016-10-07,91371755,Mark,Chaz was fantastic.  From the moment I booked it he was very communicative about everything.  Very detailed instructions for arrival so there was absolutely no confusion.  Place was very clean and comfortable.  Chaz is an excellent host and had all kinds of recommendations on things to do in SF.  I know the city well so that wasn't that important to me but for someone coming in that does not know the area I can see how that would be welcome.  Definitely would recommend staying with this great host.
28764476,532436562,2019-09-19,293481791,Gareth,I had such a great experience! The check in process was so smooth and the guide that Fadi provided was super helpful and accurate.

26950540,510918236,2019-08-16,25549229,Pelin,Worst airbnb experience ever. Weird smell throughout the house. Uncomfortable and tight bed. No toilet paper boxes everywhere. Mentioned I was coming with my friend bunch of times prior to arrival. Host does not mention 65 dollar second guest fee until I check in. When I said “oh I wish you let me know earlier” host became short sarcastic and VERY passive aggressive to a point where she started scaring me and my friend. When we decided to stay somewhere else mostly because the host’s attitude she started personally verbally attacking me sending me inappropriate messages to my cell phone.
6836928,251293856,2018-04-07,35848564,Gervase,very nice modern space in a great area
13788749,130828859,2017-02-08,66125629,Rachel,This listing is perfect for a solo (or couple) traveller in San Francisco! Easy 20+ minute walk to downtown and leisurely 1 hour walk to Fisherman's Wharf. I also walked to the Golden Gate Bridge but stopped along the way a few times so not sure about the exact timing but it was very easy. The room is great excellent value and Kandle was an extremely kind and helpful host! Definitely would stay again
22230201,322677918,2018-09-13,11214747,David,From the beautiful view of the city through the bay windows to the spacious comfortable bedroom and bathroom to the great neighborhood Carol's place is hard to beat.  Suzanna Carol's daughter was a great communicator welcoming me and providing me with all the necessary information to make my stay memorable. Now that I've experienced a few days in San Francisco I want to return soon and I'm hoping that I'll be lucky enough to secure this charming place again.

5480795,345321308,2018-11-04,49615436,Itzel,"It is a well located place very comfortable and close to mostly everything (it can feel sometimes far because of the hills if you go by walking) but truth is it is a pretty small city.

They offer coffee and bread in the mornings also juice and tea which is nice; they are very friendly people and welling to help with everything you ask for.

Nice neighbourhood just a couple blocks from a street full of places for eating and bars there’s a couple stores around the block to get what you need a Walgreens near by and more. 

Would stay again. 

:)"
15314587,511681473,2019-08-17,218479452,Jessica,Stayed here with 2 others for 3 months over the course of a summer. Jo Anne is excellent at speedy responses and was able to quickly address the few issues we had during our stay. Location is just two blocks away from some of the best dim sum in the country. Wifi can be a bit spotty if you're trying to make a video call or play games but otherwise it's fine. Place was very clean and well furnished with anything we would possibly need.
12175415,103458764,2016-09-22,75840349,Allyson,"I would definitely recommend this place for a stay in San fransisco. Our flight arrived at 9 am (much earlier than check in) and Deborah allowed us to stop by and drop our bags off so we could enjoy our day out and about. The place is very clean and well kept. Deborah is very easy to get ahold of and replies to texts in a timely manner. We didn't rent a car on our visit but uber is very easy to use for the distances you don't want to walk. We took Deborah's advice and had breakfast at ""eats"" one morning which was delicious. We also took her advise and tried bstar which was AMAZING! I would definitely recommend going there for happy hour... or anytime really. "
2677288,47923182,2015-09-21,44311226,William,James was a great host who made me feel very welcome. He was also accommodating when my arrival time changed last minute. The place was nice and the neighborhood lively. I'll definitely keep my eye on this place next time I stay in the area. 
2123469,171801585,2017-07-18,88323272,Venkata,Nice house and great location close to Golden gate park and very accommodative hosts. There can be 3 other guests in the place  something to consider for family visits . There is a friendly big dog with the owner which was not known until after booking confirmation. We felt bit uncomfortable when dog is around us at the dining table
3182798,329415620,2018-09-28,2134001,Ethan,What a unique spot. Good value and a bit of adventure. Easy walk to the financial district where we had a work event. Coffee on the top deck in the morning was a great way to start the day.

The place itself was clean and in accordance with pictures. Doris and Liz were friendly and easy to communicate with. They had got us some groceries such as milk eggs bagels bacon etc for our arrival which was a lovely and much appreciated surprise. Would definitely recommend Doris’ place.
30275221,436300671,2019-04-12,66690957,Jasmin,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei Jessica. Die Unterkunft ist gut gelegen. Innerhalb von 5-10 min erreicht man Bus- und Straßenbahnhaltestellen. 
Der Mission District ist toll. Es gibt viel zu sehen und direkt um die Ecke ist auch ein super leckeres Frühstückscafé. 
Das Zimmer ist im Erdgeschoss und hat eine kleine Küchenzeile mit Kühlschrank Mikrowelle und Wasserkocher. 
Außerdem hat Jessica an alles gedacht was man so brauchen könnte wie z.B. Kaffee Tee Wasser Müsli. Das war wirklich super! 
Sie hat immer sofort geantwortet und war sehr hilfsbereit! Danke!! 
Die Matratze war für uns zu weich. 
Ansonsten war alles sehr sauber und das Bettzeug und die Handtücher hochwertig. 
Dieses kleine Apartment können wir wirklich weiterempfehlen."

Thank you Stephanie!
20267540,246112676,2018-03-24,43498268,Amos,"We cannot rave enough about our stay at Gabriela’s. It seemed like every detail was taken in to consideration both in our private room and in the shared spaces.
We felt completely welcome and at home and had a wonderful time exploring the city with Gabriela’s amazing tips while coming back to her very chic SF home.
Can’t wait to return! Thank you so much!"

Most importantly of all Stephanie was a caring attentive host who went to great lengths to ensure a wonderful stay. I'd love to go back sometime.
22812395,288459775,2018-07-09,47994882,Jonathan,Without a doubt one of the best AirBnBs I've ever stayed in. I loved that the place had many breakfast and snacking options. One of the first things I usually do on a trip is go to a Walmart to fill in those gaps but was pleasantly surprised that it was covered. Loved the amount of towels available in the space. Five people could have easily stayed comfortably. The space feels relatively modern and clean. And most importantly the host was very attentive to our needs. Highly recommended!!
16556338,404339551,2019-01-23,56142267,Maliha,We enjoyed our stay at Herbert's! Great view from the deck and a very nice house! Herbert also gave us some good tips and was very responsive. Wish we could have stayed longer!
35710003,566233440,2019-11-18,52780306,James & Barbara,"The castle room was awesome! Didn't have a kid to sleep in to of the castle. Just two adults and it was great. I was a little concerned with only one bathroom and four rooms sharing. Thought it would be a problem in morning. To my surprise it absolutely was no problem. Only one morning someone was in shower when we got up time get ready. Other guests were very aware that multiple people use one bathroom so everyone was quick.
The room was extremely quite even being on a busy street.  You don't hear anything!
Everything was great and this is our go time spot when we come visit our son!"

1203172,21341027,2014-10-15,20587442,Katharina,"Our host was in friendly and informative email contact with us prior to our arrival.  Upon arrival we found a very welcoming note on the table and the mini fridge in the room was stocked with wonderful beverages.
The description of the accommodations were very accurate and the neighborhood was very nice and felt safe even at night."
15478431,488250104,2019-07-14,59781661,Jamie,"I would HIGHLY recommend this boat as part of your San Fran experience. The space was clean and surprisingly spacious we only had 2 people but talked about easily fitting 4 for our next stay. 

The location off Pier 39 was perfect and allowed quick access to all the city has to offer. We were a little worried about being so close to a popular pier and if there would be too much noise but it was very quiet at night although we did make the mistake of leaving the ceiling port hole (not sure what you call it haha) open the first night which did let a lot of noise in the second night we closed it and slept wonderfully! 

The kitchen and bathroom amenities were perfect for a short stay and the marina building with showers was conveniently just steps away! The check in process was a breeze and we really enjoyed getting to meet the owner and getting a brief but thorough tour of the boat and it's amenities. We felt very safe the whole time security was definitely present and even questioned us one night to make sure we were supposed to be there. It was nice to know they were checking in on the marina and made us feel even more secure. 

We were even greeted by a sea lion on the dock next to the boat we named him Sammy feel free to tell him we say hi if you end up booking this boat! He was a nice quiet guy no barking and only had one eye. He added such a nice element to our trip that we will never forget.

You'll get amazing views of Alcatraz the Golden Gate Bridge (on clear days) the Bay Bridge and AMAZING sunsets perfect for enjoying a  bottle of wine for. We wish we had planned more time to just sit on the boat and enjoy views because it was very hard to leave on the last day. San Fran has SO much to offer but if you plan on booking this boat be sure to build some ""boat time"" into your itinerary. At night we enjoyed listening to the waves and even fell asleep on the bow of the boat (with a blanket of course!) both nights! 

We definitely left our Hearts in San Francisco on The Irish Rouge next to our guard sea lion Sammy - we can't wait to return and stay on this boat again!!"
20803354,419751701,2019-03-04,94952066,Hubert,Nice place very quiet and comfortable
14030807,102749312,2016-09-19,67086851,Oleg,Preston is a very good host. We had easy access to the house as you can enter it via secret code at any time of the day/night. All the pictures of the house are the real ones and our arrival was very welcoming. I'd recommend the place to future tenants and I'd stay again at Preston's place.

He also had some great advices for nearby locations bus stops etc. He was very helpful with everything. The apartment is very well located in a nice neighbourhood with a lot of restaurants and bars. Many attractions are easy to reach by feet (Coit Tower Fisherman's Wharf Cable Cars). If you are not afraid to walk it is also possible to walk to the Golden Gate Bridge (2h) or to Height Ashbury (25h). The apartment has a small bathroom and a big kitchen.

The bed was so amazingly comfortable neighborhood was quiet and close to buses and even the subway snacks and coffee provided very functional small kitchen (we ate breakfast in and sampled SF restaurants) beautiful shower... all the details were considered in this place.  We had a truly magical week.  Thank you Don you're an awesome host.  Cat"

Their place is beautifully presented very clean and located in a nice quiet street yet is very close to all the best shops and restaurants in the area. 
We were delighted to find that the fridge stocked with yummy things to eat and drink which made it feel like home. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely recommend it to friends and family and will be returning ourselves. Thanks again guys you have a wonderful place. "
14990478,280222621,2018-06-22,183336904,Steve,The cottage is cozy but it is very tiny and there aren't much extra space for anything other than to take shower and sleep.  The cottage directly faces the back of the house where the host lives.  And their back door was open the whole time we were there which made it feel not entirely private.  Still it is a charming place and that is all we needed so it worked for us.  
6957662,328961149,2018-09-27,25321359,Steve,commercial area with restaurants and shopping and also close to public transportation.

Die Küche ist großartig ausgestattet deshalb haben wir einen Abend selbst gekocht. Mit Bussen und Uber ist die Innenstadt schnell und einfach zu erreichen. 
Nächstes mal werde ich wieder bei Chaz übernachten! "
1620411,109006451,2016-10-18,97006167,Elaine,"Amitsa and JeanLuc were so very accommodating. Keys available to us upon our arrival and very flexible checkout time. We felt very cozy and at home here. Pleasantly surprised that the place has been updated even more since the photos. New flooring and layout of furniture very nice. Very clean and most importantly comfy bed & pillows! 
Love the location. It is true that the little one above makes plenty of noise; however as grandparents of a two year old we were not bothered! -And the noise was mostly during the day so it did not disturb our sleep. We will most definitely return!"
4026354,338162699,2018-10-18,77862373,Steffi,"Unterkunft war wie beschrieben. Für 4 Leute genau ausschreichend. Eigener Parkplatz. Leider waren die Nachbarn von oben immer sehr laut wenn es dunkel wurde und man schlafen wollte. Dafür kann Candy aber nichts. Leider war auch die Spülmaschine defekt.
Candy hat Wein und ein paar Cracker als Willkommensgeschenk gestellt das war eine sehr nette Geste. Danke.
Die Umgebung war leider nicht so prickelnd. Kaum brauchbare Restaurants keine Lebensmittelläden. Dafür sehr ruhig und wenig Verkehr."
30294321,463198985,2019-06-02,130294204,Alaine,The host canceled this reservation 52 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1985338,60695857,2016-01-26,26570341,George,"If you want to stay in a quaint five star hotel off the beaten path look no further! You’ve just found the perfect place to stay in San Francisco! Nichole and Julien are excellent hosts and my daughter had an awesome time with their daughter. 

Despite their busy schedule Nicole and Julien were attentive to our needs and provided all that they advertised and more. The accommodations are spacious and the food provided for breakfast was excellent. My two year old daughter loved the backyard and deck—she enjoyed reaching for the lemons in the trees! The bathroom was nigh-perfect. There was never ever a shortage of hot water for our family of three and the shower head  was adjustable which made bathing my daughter a snap.

The location is excellent for those wishing to explore all of San Francisco. The nearby Bernal Park has a fabulous view of the city. There is a bus near the house that goes through Castro and will take you near the Painted Ladies Delores Park and about a 15-20 minute walk from Golden Gate Park. Another bus will take you directly to the BART which provides direct access to the popular tourist destinations. 

I strongly recommend this accommodation for: long stays; families with small children; those who like walking to get somewhere; those who like good coffee; those who plan well; those who want peace and quiet; or those who need a good working environment. (I had work deadlines during our stay.)

654279,79627755,2016-06-13,57877292,Yana,We stayed with Tim since Chris was on a trip himself. It was super lovely and clean and couldn't have been better. Great location and Tim is absolutely awesome. I will miss the early morning chats in the kitchen :-)
657121,316683658,2018-08-31,54060385,Sasha,San Francisco! What a city! I took time in choosing the right accommodation and we all agreed that we could have not done it better! How lucky we were to find Trevor and his amazing apartment on North Beach. The place is modern beautiful spacious so well equipped and has the most fantastic views! The top floor has glass walls overlooking Lombard St the Golden Gate Bridge the bay… an ever-changing view. So much of the great area was within a walking distance or a short car ride away. Trevor was an outstanding host! Always quick with the most thorough and informative replies useful tips and clear directions. Thank you Trevor for helping us to make this experience a very special to us! I highly recommend this property anyone would be in for a real treat.
19877901,329766615,2018-09-29,102129340,Katie,Big room with a good bed and coffee maker is a nice touch. We used the BART during our stay the walk is about 15 minutes which we found fine. Roberto and Julia were great hosts Roberto even gave us a lift all the way to Pier 33 (Alcatraz) when he saw us walking to the BART one morning! Would recommend as an affordable place to stay while in San Francisco.
1864390,53805257,2015-11-13,15793219,Tess,"Kaleen was a great host. Met us at the apartment and had put the heat on for us as it was a cold evening. She had maps of San Francisco and tourist brochures in the place. It was a really big apartment lovely bedrooms two bathrooms. Spacious and very nice. The location was great for walking distance to Hayes Street where there is alot of restaurants and bars. It is quite far from the metro system.

However Kaleen had said there was parking easily available but we could not find any parking and struggled every day to move the car from one 2hr spot to another. There really wasn't any place to park your car all day whilst out sight-seeing. This was the only problem we had with the listing otherwise it was amazing. "

It is so close so it makes coming back and forth extremely easy. If you have a meeting and left something you can run back and get it. Also if you too much stuff you can drop it off easily to lighten the load."

1525886,172381977,2017-07-20,112532887,Stina,Jag och min partner spenderade två nätter i Delilahs otroligt charmiga lägenhet. Rummet vi sov i var väldigt rymligt och rent med en stor bekväm säng. Vi anlände senare än vi bestämt på grund av problem i trafiken men Delilah såg ändå till att vara vaken till vår ankomst och var väldigt vänlig. Området kändes tryggt och parkeringen var lättillgänglig. Jag rekommenderar varmt detta boende om ni vill ha en äkta San Francisco-upplevelse med en tillmötesgående värd!
114401,86574292,2016-07-17,78729346,Wessel,Had a great time staying at George's place! Amazing location comfortable bed and a beautiful balcony with an amazing view.

4607177,508358983,2019-08-12,82904090,Kara,Lindsay's place was perfect for a 3-night stay! She was very responsive and quick to accommodate my early check-in. The place is beautifully furnished and Lindsay includes thoughtful touches like chocolates wine and coffee! The location is amazing--only a few short steps to Coit Tower and right in the heart of Telegraph Hill. I had a wonderful experience staying at Lindsay's place and definitely recommend!

His place is very clean great layout and spacious. The location was perfect for a short ride into the city every morning for the conference I was attending. He did everything to make me feel at home and make sure I enjoyed my time in San Fransico. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay at Rigo's home again.

And the main thing - we stayed in many places during this trip but stay in San Francisco was the most memorable because of great hosts - Esther and Kevin! Thank you again and I hope to stay in touch!
2502543,17499819,2014-08-13,12541768,Deborah,"Check in was smooth.
Place was as described - spacious comfortable with everything we needed.
We loved the neighbourhood. We explored other areas but our favourite place was right at the top of the street - vibrant interesting fun. The diner at York & 24th St is amazing and just minutes away and there's a host of other stuff too.
Great for families or for anyone who loves city life.
Host was accomodating."

1898486,11831105,2014-04-16,12439396,Sabine,We stayed with our two children in Ed and Sunny's cottage for a couple days only and I'm convinced we were able to have the best stay we could thanks to the friendliness of our host. The cottage is really comfortable highly qualitative situated in a great location. On top of this we have been warmly welcomed and greatly advised on the activities worth the detour :-) We would love to come back and definitely stay longer!
2592518,329393401,2018-09-28,28051648,Jeremy,Great spot - great location - easy checkin. Felt like a hotel bathroom (in a good way!) - clean lots of toiletries and plenty of towels!
2115503,51015957,2015-10-17,39650034,Rachel,My boyfriend and I had a great time staying at Anthony's place in San Francisco.  It was our first time doing Air BnB and we were impressed by how easy and convenient it was.  Anthony was great giving us heads up info before we arrived to make getting in a breeze.  He also gave us fantastic recommendations for local restaurants and we loved the uber pool he suggested for getting around the city.  We loved the neighborhood.  It was quiet but still close to all the city has to offer and the proximity to the ocean was a big plus!  The place was clean and comfortable.  We wished we could have stayed longer.  Highly recommend this AirBnb!
8195144,133768798,2017-02-24,11525909,Kimberly,Great location and very clean.  Elena was a great host. :)

51557,3238206,2013-01-03,2955138,Jamie,"I spent an extended stay in San Francisco in Len's Studio on Hermann Street during November and December 2012. What a great place - excellently located with Market the Mission Lower Haight Castro and Hays Valley all within close walking distance. The Muni is also right on your door step for travel further afield and there are plenty of grocery shops all around including a huge Safeways. The studio itself is extremely spacious with a great living space with huge south facing victorian bay windows and fully equipped eat in kitchen (everything you could want from dishwasher fridge freezer to coffee machine!). A very clean and modern bathroom with possibly the best shower I have ever had (although bear in mind I am from London - not know for great plumbing and water pressure!).

Overall an excellent place to stay - I had the best time ever - couldn't fault it at all - I will definitely be back!"
21812815,295585952,2018-07-23,117648968,Vero,"Aaron was a great host even that we never met him . The location of the Appartement is really good and only a few steps away from the bus station.
Would take the Appartement again!!!"
9563163,129404016,2017-01-30,9286914,Fanny,Dani was very friendly and welcoming. The room and apartment are lovely and close to everything so very convenient to visit! It was a very pleasant stay and the smile of Dani contributed! And her cats are so nice ! Thanks for all Dani !
22601496,254940429,2018-04-18,181559399,Alma,The place was just as described. The room we had which had a private bath as well was clean and tidy. Appreciate that they provided the house slippers. Very convenient to the city and also close to Sutro Baths which was nice to take a stroll to. We liked that there was street parking as well. Would definitely stay there again!
213532,200526099,2017-10-05,64801775,Cindy,The place is overall cozy. Bathroom is shared. Didn't get any clean up for the room even though we payed the service and cleaning fees. Can't complain much because the price is fairly worth it.
6836785,308096148,2018-08-15,273278,Christina,Great stay!  Thanks Erika! 
14790424,317193601,2018-09-01,5638045,Shih-Ho,We had a great time staying at Jana and Peter's home. The listing was accurately described clean comfortable and conveniently located. On top of that Jana and Peter's were totally terrific hosts!

998701,329392650,2018-09-28,181936868,Sandra,Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei Martha und Tony. Beide sind sehr freundlich und herzlich und haben uns mit tollen Tipps versorgt. 100 prozentige Weiterempfehlung von uns! Wir haben uns direkt wie zuhause gefühlt.
11910999,520052412,2019-08-29,18148276,Rachel,Roberto was very kind  accommodating and communicative no doubt. I HATE leaving bad reviews  But the level of cleanliness from this air bnb should  NOT be allowed. The bathroom was so filthy that I did not even shower. Also I was kind of disappointed because it was not specified as “shared bath”. I’m all for the vintage  and shabby chic stay  I wasn’t expecting anything new. But cleanliness should not be ignored.
3133266,102914992,2016-09-19,18443026,Polina,Jay and Tina are very welcoming hosts the flat is quite spacious and very well localed in a nice neighbourhood. The communications were very prompt. One bedroom is slightly loud as the windows are going to the road but the other two bedrooms are quite and nice. The place overall is very cosy and you always feel like home.
256176,289632991,2018-07-12,85262572,Asher,Eva is an amazing host. She is very quick to communicate and check that everything is ok. Her place is right next to public transport that takes you all over the city. A few blocks away is Haight-Ashbury Streets and whole foods. I would come back here in a heartbeat. Thankyou Eva!

19813728,174062655,2017-07-24,30859374,Francis,Kin et Mustapha sont un jeune couple très charmant et accueillant qui ont cherché à nous être agréable durant les 5 jours de notre séjour chez eux. Leur appartement est situé dans une rue tranquille et proche d'un joli parc. Nous recommandons ce logement.
3780418,52691084,2015-11-01,19292685,John,Everything was perfect; location amenities design value and a very helpful and friendly host. We will definitely return. We were able to get anywhere for a $5-$15 uber and several times used the bus system for only $2.25. So many very nice places were also in walking distance. Highly highly recommend! 
5007358,350241772,2018-11-18,96121050,Alana,This is a great place with a very comfortable bed and nice private bath with all the amenities you could possibly need. The space was clean and in a fantastic location. We look forward to staying here again soon thanks Tony!!
3309722,497726121,2019-07-28,3404776,Suzy,The studio was a perfect spot for our weekend in San Francisco! We were within walking distance to the Mission and Castro (where we spend most of our time) but also got a chance to explore the neighborhood of Noe Valley (which turns out is an absolute delight!). Cliff was available if we needed assistance but also allowed us our privacy - a perfect balance. The studio was outfitted with everything we needed and was comfortable inside and out (especially on the amazing rooftop deck). We would absolutely stay here again.
7680348,277602590,2018-06-16,1371515,Sarah,This wasn't my first time at Alexis and hopefully it won't be my last. The home is beautiful sparkling clean and the bed is super comfy. Alexis is a wonderful person she really cares about you. Also so many deep conversations. Stay at her place is a pleasure for me.
21484566,246968164,2018-03-26,33304289,Renee,Great space. Close to restaurants etc. Quiet neighborhood.
20799337,560444267,2019-11-06,216268278,Kristin,This place is very clean and welcoming. Perfect location for my week of business in the city.
26566885,455531750,2019-05-19,22383618,Vicki,The apartment was as described however it wasn’t sparkling clean. We thought it was a bit expensive for what it was.
55636,177345,2011-02-01,350362,Alvin,Excellent older apartment with one great view.  Clean condition with an updated kitchen.  Bonus - Paul was a very hospitable host!
16824774,413659006,2019-02-17,50305098,Marilyn,This place is amazing! The host (Penelope) is so welcoming and accommodating.  She was very flexible with our schedule and was the best host.  The space is stylish impeccably clean comfortable and serine.  The bed is super comfy too!
32813435,547724686,2019-10-15,269849888,Dan,The location and check in process could not have been more convenient. There are restaurants and a great coffee shop steps from this place along with a fantastic farmer’s market on Sunday morning. For a shared residence it was very quiet and we had zero complications with the shared restroom use. One review stated there was not a mirror in the room but we stayed in room C and there was a mirror which was great. The room was simple but very comfortable. Exactly what we needed.
213532,642609,2011-10-18,1170757,Gordon,Josh was a fantastic and accommodating host.  The room was our own and private. A lovely view out the window to an interesting tree line. I found the traffic a little much but ear plugs cost 3 bucks and they sell them everywhere.
1281132,257869141,2018-04-27,53873639,Darlene,"Space is exactly as seen in the pictures. Very clean comfortable and lots of natural light.  It’s a short walk from Courtland Avenue where there are a few boutique restaurants shops and a small grocery store. 
While easily accessible to everything by public transportation (bus/BART) it is farther away than we expected (40+ minutes depending on where you want to go). Uber and Lyft costs around  $15 to downtown. 
Eyal and Yina are the perfect hosts always available to answer any questions or provide help as needed."
28712636,527773315,2019-09-11,260720021,Steven,Great location just a few blocks from Golden Gate Park.  Interior was up-to-date beautifully furnished light and airy.  It was very well maintained and clean.
16043093,250624104,2018-04-05,124143692,Anne,Lovely place to stay especially with family. Stacy gives great recommendations for walkable sights food and activities. We especially appreciated how the space is accommodating for little ones and in a great neighborhood with easy access to San Francisco sights!
568161,132081357,2017-02-15,96944168,민주,"집주변도 조용하고 역이랑 가까워서 다운타운이동하는데 좋았습니다. Beth와 가족모두 너무 친절하고 궁금하거나 여행정도 같은 것도 직접 노트북으로 친절하게 잘 알려주세요 
집도 너무 깨끗해요"
21217809,510901015,2019-08-16,7348533,Liam,Thanks to Kim & Michael for their great communication and understanding.
4184406,27402832,2015-03-03,6282535,Isabella,perfect as usual I come here regularly and I cannot be any happier it is a must to stay at Brian's when I come to San Francisco
6628985,174375986,2017-07-25,37262724,Jessica,"The place is easy to find and Sylvie is an extremely friendly and helpful host.

There are a few things to point out for future guests: 
- parking is restricted to two hours during the working week and there is weekly street cleaning on the road although this is standard in San Francisco 
- the room is located under the main house and although Slyvie takes great care to ensure the noise is kept to a minimum if you are a light sleeper it might not be the best place for you. 
- wifi was inconsistent during our stay. Again Slyvie was extremely helpful and hopefully it was just a one-off 

Overall this is a great room with lots of space and a big ensuite at a good price. We would recommend it for a stay in San Francisco"
3759246,244880509,2018-03-19,26873982,Hugo,Location was great. Plenty of local restaurants and bars within walking distance. David is readily available to address any questions/concerns you may have and offer his personal recommendations.
27427727,345341178,2018-11-04,22742799,Amelia,This is an amazing studio it's light airy and the rooftop deck is perfect for a wine & book on a sunny day. It's also in a prime spot in lower haight a short walk to public transport great restaurants and bars. Nat was great super responsive and friendly. Love this airbnb! Highly recommended.
8167459,132072057,2017-02-15,100926782,Bobby,What a wonderful time we had at Michelle's place. She was the nicest & most accommodating host. She made Valentine's Day for me & my girlfriend memorable!! The unit was very spacious private & better than any hotel we could have found. 5 stars Michelle

26668091,511744518,2019-08-17,273409025,Raphael,"Stayed there for a 1-month business trip and it was the best place possible both regarding interior space/decoration/style and distance to the office I had to visit there (plus the many nice places parks and restaurants around the neighborhood).
Would definitely recommend to anyone that may need to visit places near it."
968046,274615047,2018-06-09,190826901,Adnan,Pk is an amazing host and he has a great apartment in a location that's really close to BART and also has the 14/14X stop just outside. The wifi was also really fast. I had a great time with Pk and his family and Pk gave me lots of great advice and tips! He was also kind enough to give me breakfast on the weekends! I can't recommend his place enough you'll be in good hands :).
20837529,418287864,2019-03-01,234044399,Yusuke,"綺麗でお勧めできます｡

2175930,476222397,2019-06-25,9271193,Shepheard,Better place in San Francisco? Not likely. The location the apartment the kitchen and supplies comfortable bed and an awesome host all counts were 100%. Thanks so much M and C. You guys and your kids are incredible!
8351923,332160601,2018-10-04,179656409,John,I will preface this by saying this was our very first time using air Bnb. This place was great!!! Walking distance to the metro and a cute little area of restaurants cafes and shops. Check in is a breeze with the key code and the unit is very private. The welcome basket was a nice touch.  Would definitely stay here again!
23326161,417282732,2019-02-26,34381603,LaBreonna,AMAZING!!!! My friend and I stayed for three days to just enjoy San Francisco and engage in tourist activities. I needed to relax after a pretty huge comprehensive exam submission they our hosts were so amazing!  From the moment we arrived we loved Levon and Ashley the space the energy everything. They were quick to answer questions offer local tips and provided all star service. I definitely plan to book again anytime I’m in SF!
8500048,142947121,2017-04-09,9553490,Dan,Brandi goes out of her way to help the guests feel welcomed and at home -- starting with clear guidance continuing with a custom welcome basket full of amazing local goodies  and being responsive throughout. Her design sense is also second to none - loved the colorful decor textures and color palette of the comfy warm interior space and the lovely backdoor garden. And it's a fantastic location in one of San Francisco's most walkable and homey neighborhoods. 
568161,7795402,2013-10-03,8645113,Xuzhi,I arrived in SF late at night and Beth stayed up waiting for me. Her dogs gave me a big welcome when I showed up. Beth's house is in a good location but not noisy at all only takes a few minutes walking form BART. Beth offered me good tips about one-day trip in SF. 
14386727,195778232,2017-09-20,94990,Albert,Sean's place is as advertised. The room has a nice little deck with a view. The place is clean.
1393654,99720274,2016-09-05,75130021,Jennifer,Kevin's place was extremely clean and tidy. The neighborhood is also very nice and quiet yet close to everything (park etc). Communication throughout the whole process was top notch. Will most definitely stay there again if we are ever back in SF!
13845578,342393835,2018-10-28,158898296,Luis,"Lance's place was great. He made sure we were comfortable at all times. 

He had some great amenities in the space. The location is very convenient to downtown San Fransisco and very easy to get an Uber to and from. Lance also had some great recommendations and was very responsive to our messages while there.

I would definetly recommend Lance's place and if I'm ever in the area again I would stay there again."
1687330,31091634,2015-05-02,24785876,Xueting,Jon was a great host he met us at the apartment which was idealy located for us near the civic center. The studio was clean and quite peaceful there's element in the area. We never felt threatened or uneasy in fact most people were nice or didn't bother you at all. 
150848,52390671,2015-10-29,29731770,Becca,"We had the most amazing time. As a first time AirBnB guest we didn't really know what to expect but this exceeded our expectations!! 
Nancy was so helpful and accommodating. She gave us so much information when we arrived which saved us hours of trying to work out where and how to get transport what sightseeing options were available etc. When we couldn't get parking she looked up so many options for us. 
The room was lovely and everything was so clean. There was everything we needed. The location was perfect to be able to get to town so quickly but stay out of the hustle and bustle! 
We know where we will try to book next time we go to San Francisco!! "
808919,564879446,2019-11-16,34925715,Filipe,This is a traditional victorian house right next to Alamo Square and the painted ladies. Susan is a lovely person and host. Her home is a great choice to stay in SF and I would definitely come back! Thank you Susan for a great time.

3442439,253537657,2018-04-14,60394650,Louise,"This is a great find in a perfect area for exploring San Francisco. Although slightly out the centre there are loads of transport options including the trains and buses. 

Candace and Joshua provided us with a clean inviting and well equipped apartment. There wasn’t anything they hadn’t thought of. 

The ‘House Guide’ is particularly helpful with lots of ideas for local food and shops. 

The Netflix and Amazon prime on the TV along with a good selection of DVDs was a nice touch. 

The outdoor area is lovely and sheltered if you wish to have an al fresco breakfast. 

The check in was seamless and sent well in advance. Upon our arrival Joshua helped us out with lots of recommendations for sight seeing in the city.  

Would highly recommend this apartment to anybody visiting the area."

7697503,316185070,2018-08-30,82900609,Mike,We enjoyed our stay at Dayne's place. He was a lovely host and the house is stylish with a spacious living area. We used public transport to get around town cheaply. We visited the downtown area and Golden Gate Park. There is a useful supermarket nearby and restaurants. We also made use of the kitchen which is well-equipped.
259622,75049368,2016-05-18,30853006,Robin,This hostel was a lot of fun! Everyone was super friendly and helpful. The bed was pretty comfortable and the bathrooms were clean!

4614763,126405653,2017-01-11,45837980,Steve,"Del's unit was perfect for my most recent visit to San Francisco. Del was quick to communicate which was important as I had a 7 hour delay in arriving. I was greeted by Del who gave me a quick tour of the unit the neighborhood and she left an anchor steam in the fridge for me (much needed after the above mentioned delay). 

The unit is very clean with everything you could need. Full kitchen modern and clean bathroom and plenty of space to relax while watching tv or catching up on emails after a work day. The bedroom was a good size with an extremely comfortable bed and a great closet. Perhaps most importantly the unit was very quiet and peaceful making for a pleasant stay after long work days.

The neighborhood was also quiet but there was plenty within walking distance. A Walgreen's just up the street would be convenient but luckily I did not need it for this trip. In terms of food there were plenty of options within walking distance. I chose the Alamac Brewery that had an excellent burger fries and beers which would I highly recommend. 

I would highly recommend this AirBnB and will look to stay here again with future visits. "
8474452,62132954,2016-02-11,19238372,Jeanine,The apartment was very nice and well appointed.  The hosts were very accommodating of check-in time. Everything you could need was available in apartment!
585225,104635372,2016-09-27,11689039,Katie,My husband and I had a very restful stay here after a friend's wedding weekend in wine country... the space felt very light and airy. With easy access to all that SF has to offer this is a relaxed neighborhood with lots of street parking. Host is super attentive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again!
84777,17146633,2014-08-08,14551119,Lone,We loved to stay at Johns place! He was a great host and the room and apartment was perfect. You will never get tired of the fantastic view over SF and we really liked the location between Heights and Castro. We were so satisfied with everything - and remember to go to the Castro Theatre!!
39724134,570579869,2019-11-29,5844585,Roman,"The space Ms. Judy offers is spectacular. We stayed in the one bedroom for two nights. Check-in was easy and safe. The main entry way is well lit and it was clear which room was ours. 
After entering our room we were so pleasantly surprised! The space was scrubbed clean we had a French press electric tea kettle plenty of linens shampoo conditioner body scrub plates cups  utensils and glasses!! 
The bed was comfortable; just the right amount of firm and soft. Oh! And when it was time for a shower the water heated up quickly!!
The one bedroom has access to the backyard! It was a simple and serene place to be.
There is plenty of free parking. I was able to find a spot directly in front of Ms. Judy's home all three days. 
We enjoyed our walks to the beach and back! So simple! 
Please consider staying here if you want a full service clean communicative respectful and comfortable Airbnb experience."
16456337,145530036,2017-04-18,28414622,Anna,Megan and Manny are great hosts - we felt really welcomed at their home from booking until leaving. The bed is really comfortable and their tips on places to visit and eat were so useful. Noe Valley was a lovely neighbourhood with lots of shops and restaurants just a couple of blocks from the apartment and getting public transport to other parts of the city was straightforward. We had a great stay - thanks!
5559608,428229548,2019-03-24,100059986,James,This is a cozy place in the beautiful Noe Valley neighborhood. It’s nice and quiet for San Francisco. The location is super convenient as it’s just steps from the Muni J line with easy access to Mission Dolores Park Valencia Street downtown and the Embarcadero. There’s train noise but it didn’t bother us one bit. Matthew is a great host and was super flexible with our check in time. Highly recommended!
795254,523898601,2019-09-04,48422966,Florian,Janes’ beautiful and clean apartment in Lower Haights (good neighborhood) is the perfect location to explore the city of San Francisco. We really enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend it to others. Thank you Jane for your great hospitality!
10599384,69592841,2016-04-11,42743805,Erik,"This was a great place to stay in SF! Good friendly neighbourhood close to stores cafés and restaurants. The host is a great guy who we became friends with while staying there. Very generous friendly and hospitable. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in SF.

7009654,45729632,2015-09-05,42536675,Jonah,The place was clean and cozy with charming San Fransisco character. The place was airy with big windows and a lot of light. Host was easy to communicate with. We enjoyed our stay. 
725300,123990087,2016-12-31,57757434,Amanda,Great parking and lovely home.

8472927,54646401,2015-11-22,20504904,Parke,Liliya and Alexander's place was just what we needed.  After a long flight from London their place was a quick drive from the airport clean quiet and well furnished.  The bed was very comfortable and the kitchenette was stocked with tea coffee orange juice and bagels/cream cheese.  There were several restaurants nearby that Liliya and Alexander suggested all of which looked great.  The street was nice and very quiet.  
12115392,431312478,2019-03-31,135759328,Vincent,Ethan’s place was close to all the popular hot spots no more than a short Uber/Lyft ride. The room was welcoming and clean. Bed was pretty comfy and Ethan provided an extra comforter that came in handy for the  slightly chilly morning. Parking can be an inconvenience if you check-in around noon as many people are out and about enjoying the sunny weather by the nearby Dolores park. The bathroom could be a tad bit cleaner but wasn’t a big deal for us. Overall enjoyed our stay and would recommend! :)
213532,20328471,2014-09-28,1338817,Sonja,The location is great close to many bars and restaurant and in an historic charming house. Definitely a great spot for San Francisco.
21385697,300706220,2018-08-02,67530856,Dehlia,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I'm so glad it was with Keisha and her beautiful home. 

As a woman traveling on her own I was apprehensive about using Airbnb but after this I feel much better about it. Her home made me very comfortable after a long day out. Everything was clean and tidy and the amenities were great. The extra room was lovely with space to work or just relax and take in the view.

If I ever needed to come back to this area I'd love to stay here again."
216064,467491513,2019-06-10,25405139,Eric,The tour was very worthwhile; Benjamin provided smart and insightful commentary that was relevant and well presented.
15179182,205023790,2017-10-20,8648142,Samuel,Um espaço muito aconchegante em São Francisco. Nossos anfitriões foram muito gentis e nós tivemos uma excelente estadia.
16797018,416978531,2019-02-25,67825901,Melanie,Sarah & Pankaj's place is absolutely marvelous.  It is beautiful peaceful a place to meet people from around the world and I felt at home.  I love the friendliness I experienced there.  The accommodations are comfortable and the home has exquisite finishes.  This is the place to stay when I visit San Francisco.  Melanie
2488520,26260525,2015-02-08,21788082,Michael,"Gabe was a gracious host!  The e-locking mechanism really made my late arrival due to the weather a snap.  What a great host to have as my first Airbnb experience.  The loft is very cute clean neat.  Amenities are a plus.  

The neighborhood is certainly a tad ""salty"" but we never had any problem.

Garage spot was a HUGE +.  I didn't start the week with a car but I went out and picked up a rental car with no fear that I'd have a great parking spot! "
24749696,364517956,2018-12-30,233005867,Austin,Overall great stay
1229606,32843754,2015-05-22,24446498,Domingo,Johns place was just the type of hospitality we were looking for during a work trip. Middle of SOMA and walking distance to a lot of happy hour and food spots. The pull out couch is in a private room which gave us the two person privacy we were looking for in a two bedroom but still being economical. 
862201,40721296,2015-08-02,14803042,Rosalie,We love the beautiful kitchen and amazing shower.  Our stay was relaxing and comfortable.  Thank you Jojo!
212783,228059401,2018-01-17,153266521,Ryan,Very good location in the midst of things. Small space but good for someone who just needs a place to sleep and wants to explore town by day.
37427876,551834351,2019-10-20,8049302,Jackie,"Everything about my one night was great!  As I was enjoying my tea (provided) out in the garden in the morning a hummingbird came by to say ""Hello"".  I couldn't believe it."
24723,172351,2011-01-19,184273,Julie,We had a wonderful stay in Cynthia and Steve's apartment and would definitely recomend it. We really enjoyed staying in a San Francisco neighbourhood and looking at the architecture of the houses and buildings in the area. We found the public transport very convenient and easy to use and it was also close enough to walk to Union Square. Steve was very welcoming and accomodating and willing to give information about San Francisco.  The apartment was very clean spacious warm and nicely presented. Shower was great and bed very comfortable. It is definitely a  basement apartment but as we were out and about all day the lack of a view didn't bother us. 
2670951,23012900,2014-11-20,22995705,Manuel,"This was our first airbnb experience. The place is exactly as described on the photos. The apartment is comfortable newly renovated and very clean (take off your shoes please). We knew that parking would be an issue so we didn't rent a car for our stay but used used Zipcar by the day on those days that we wanted to do day trips outside the city leaving the car where we found it at the end of the day. There are a couple of Zipcar locations a few blocks away. 

 We took a taxi in and out to the airport because we didn't want to take any chances; but if you are traveling light you could use the train and bus there and back. The place can easily sleep 6 people since it has three bedrooms. The master bedroom is very comfortable and has its own bathroom. 
It is a two story building and downstairs is a business. It has it's own stairs and entrance.  

We had a minor miscommunication on our arrival time. Our flight arrived at the expected arrival time we arrived at the apartment ""early"" at 9:20PM but we found the downstairs gate closed shut so we couldn't access the stairs to the door and access the apartment. After some distressed calling the housekeeper showed up after 20 minutes to open the gate and took care of that problem. Thank you for the quick reaction!

The apartment is located on a busy main artery with access to mass transit (buses). I recommend that you plan your public transit trips using (Hidden by Airbnb) maps and look at the transit time. It changes according to the traffic. 

There are a lot of places to eat and we used a few but most of the time we were out and about the city or the country side arriving late at night.  For breakfast starting at 8:00AM we strongly recommend ""Eats"" at 50 Clement St. This place has one of the best breakfast meals that we have had. The neighborhood is safe but if you don't live in a city the first day you may be taken aback. We live in a suburb so it took us a day to get used to it; after that it was home! 

Pat her husband and son were always a text or call away. Very responsive. If you request suggestions of what to do Pat is very helpful on this regard as well.

I hope the you find this review helpful. 

The only thing that we regret is not staying a little longer. We couldn't fit everything on 7 days.

14852542,562994370,2019-11-11,18513597,Sandra,Megan's place is very clean inspiring comfortable and ideally located in the heart of it all.  I highly recommend it if you wish for a homey stay.  Megan was very accommodating.
4387067,142940938,2017-04-09,118678212,Catherine,Great location room and host! Highly recommended. 
11421711,316688685,2018-08-31,15758623,Andrew,Mark and Sarah were great hosts! They live upstairs but the airbnb part of the house is completely separate so you have your own space living room etc. It was a great clean and comfortable place to stay private bathroom and with everything we needed (such as kitchen stuff). Great location with some nice places to eat/drink just a few min walk away. Take a look at Mark and Sarah's tips on the kitchen wall with their favourite local places. That was great! There are a few bus stops in the area so it's easy to get around. Definitely recommend.
437385,91042216,2016-08-03,81698536,Stephen,It was my first time using Airbnb and didn't know what to expect. Melanie has a lovely home and she was very accommodating. The room was very clean with a new private bath. I would highly recommend this rental. It was much better than I expected.
6080799,172375912,2017-07-20,61282208,Erica,Saras place was so cute and so close to the ocean! Its a short uber ride away from public transportation. She was so great at communication!!
6120540,221526157,2017-12-26,160743388,Simon,I just want to say thank you Philip and Pam. Thanks for letting us stay in such a lovely and comfortable room during Christmas. Very clean and helpful. Thumbs up in every regard 
20873957,206967888,2017-10-27,61577817,Brent,Great place to stay at while we were in town for work.  I would stay there again.  Jefferson was a great host and his home is very comfortable and clean. A++
18596420,432693969,2019-04-04,250703486,Erica,It was exactly what it was reported to be. A basement apartment in the suburbs. There were food options to walk to and we never had a hard time being picked by an Uber.
59381,100505596,2016-09-09,53844339,Brad,another great stay. Met some other nice guests this week
10494263,329404213,2018-09-28,192729868,Alan,It was a wonderful experience stay with Liz. She was able to give lots of good local advice for how to get around and places to go. I feel I got a much more local experience of San Francisco than I would have if I had just gotten a hotel. It was also an incredible value for my conference.
30091565,507652099,2019-08-11,137667328,William,Good place very helpful host. Easy check in and helpful advice. Parking was no problem used the medical center for weekdays and weekend parking was free.   It was easy to find as well.
17237462,430104309,2019-03-29,2497381,Andrew,Nice little spot in the mission. Really enjoyed the neighborhood--there are a dozen amazing taquerias within blocks. Easy access to the rest of the city too. House is nice definitely feels like you're in someone's home which is a nice change from some of the other options in SF.
30888683,538544058,2019-09-29,244018200,Julia,Nice location and a perfect place for two guests. Everything was clean and much more was provided than I expected! Bed was okay definitely a place for a shorter trip. WiFi was good and there was a bunch of outlets and closet space. Overall a great experience and great hosts.
4069838,59762658,2016-01-15,43544809,Hongliu,The place is brilliant! We had a wonderful experience there and Ashley is also very nice. We love the garage the decoration books and the small garden.  
11345707,526282067,2019-09-08,108544461,Sarah,This cottage was a perfect home base for exploring San Francisco!  It was an easy BART ride from SFO and into the City.  We really enjoyed the thoughtful touches like drinks snacks toiletries and Clipper Cards for use!  The bed was very comfortable and all communication was very timely.  Would definitely stay here again!
29037491,338177389,2018-10-18,135525070,Geof,A nice place on a bustling street but quiet at night.
3612236,62023931,2016-02-10,19268589,Kendra,"This is actually a very impersonal pseudo-hotel.  It is not someone's flat.  The host did not interact with us at all and the front desk seemed to be manned by international exchange type young people who were eager to be helpful but had very little information or influence on how things were run.

It was very bad value for the money.  At 200 dollars a night for two people the room was clean but entirely monastic in its simplicity. There were worn out towels but no hand soap or any other added value: no breakfast or mini fridge or added amenities that you might have if you stay in someone's home.  The internet was so weak that you could barely get the signal to e-mail someone let alone watch Netflix.  They were also renovating the hotel rooms on the same floor so there were noisy construction noises starting quite early in the morning.  "
4121691,131609133,2017-02-12,56853194,Nick,Cute and very practical. Great use of space and lots of obvious upkeep and investment. My family had a great time. I would come back. Great access to the zoo and beaches. Close to the trolley system. Very clean and safe feeling neighborhood.
5151423,207759600,2017-10-29,154232354,Carla,Beautiful private garden a chance to see the inside of an old SF home.  We are big people and bed was much more comfortable than we anticipated.  There is a desk for computer if you are working.  Little dog was no issue at all.  Lots of authentic restaurants especially Asian and little fresh grocery stores and bakeries  We walk to Japanese Tea Garden botanical garden deYoung Art Museum and California Academy of Science with a great aquarium plus frequent concerts.  Don't be afraid here my son lives 5 blocks away and I have strolled my grandkids in the area for years and walk around at night.
11494067,70341661,2016-04-17,6082441,Kathryn,"Catherine's spacious Bernal Heights studio was amazing! I live in the area and wanted a place to stay for my mother's visit to San Francisco. The location is at the heart of Bernal Heights one block off of Cortland where you'll find restaurants bars cute shops and markets. The neighborhood is sunny with lush flowering trees against a backdrop of charming San Francisco homes. Two blocks up is Bernal Hill an amazing park with 360 degree views of the city and walking trails. Public transportation is available nearby and street parking is very easy in this area compared to other San Francisco neighborhoods. 

The apartment was soo nice. It's huge for a studio and has a separate area for the bed closest and bathroom - so basically a master suite on one end of the studio. The other end has a spacious living room with lots of natural light from windows on three sides and access to an outside yard surrounded by a tall fence for lots of privacy. The kitchen is new and modern and was fully stocked with dishes and necessities which was such a nice touch. Catherine even supplied coffee and a few snacks which was soo appreciated! All of the appliances are new. 

This place is decorated incredibly nicely and with so much style. It's modern yet warm and inviting and so so clean! The mattress and bedding were clearly very high quality and the bedroom closets were stocked with extra towels sheets and even two luxury bath robes. 

Everything about this place was perfect. Catherine was an exceptional host and made sure to check in and make sure everything was ok. 

Thanks Catherine! "
19236728,332605882,2018-10-05,202566232,Craig,Large spacious and comfortable room. Hotel in a great location. Great communication from host. Couldn't ask for more!
13046853,309778988,2018-08-18,3092635,Victoria,We had a lovely stay at this apartment. It’s in a great location and close to the main Castro high street and a great base to explore the city. The apartment is comfortable and has everything you’ll need. The garden is great and was a sun trap in the afternoons. Greg was very helpful and a great host. 
72921,726327,2011-11-17,1218452,Jacqueline,The location was great just a few blocks from Haight with some good restaurants within walking distance. The building was a bit older than expected but the apartment was spacious and comfortable. 
851889,279806166,2018-06-21,9857476,Matt,"Wren's home was absolutely perfect and she thought of everything to make the stay comfortable. The bed and pillows were some of the most comfortable I've ever slept on in an Airbnb. Wren had chargers for every electronic device and they were perfectly placed around the home. She was generous by offering her food in the pantry and beverages in the fridge. 

Her view is fantastic and a perfect place for sunset. I enjoyed opening the windows and reading a book while the breeze came through. This was one of the best airbnb's I've ever stayed in."
5345792,59767731,2016-01-15,51521143,Damien,Leo is great. Super Host. The place is amazing. Well decorated with a great view on Mission. 
4106442,29615413,2015-04-10,3304514,Larry,This is a great apartment. The backyard is lovely and there were a lot of emeneties. If you like staying in the mission this is really the perfect place 
10367010,464088802,2019-06-04,157067206,Ronny,Room was comfortable very clean and in very good condition the toilet was clean excellent WiFi connection .  Neighbourhood was nice and safe with easy access to public transport (2 minutes walk) however it could take up to one hour to get to Fisherman’s warf. the location is ideal if you are driving. Parking could be a little bit challenging if you are arriving late as all places in the street may be taken. The only negative point in my opinion is that the room doesn’t qualify as studio apartment as there is not kitchen whatsoever there is just a long narrow shelf with some dishes cutleries toaster and a microwave. The sink actually is for washing clothes as it is part of the laundry room with a fridge this laundry room is basically located at the entrance of the room with independent entrance through the garage.
19150623,466964296,2019-06-09,254643285,Lisa,Nice quiet neighborhood. Easy access to public transportation and by car. We used both. The house was comfortable and had enough room for us to be together and in our own rooms when needed. Comfy beds. Jessica was available almost immediately to answer questions or help when needed. I appreciated it We enjoyed our stay.
4948340,236896502,2018-02-20,38793384,Aaron,Great location and Budi is a great host!
585225,43479112,2015-08-20,16954961,Michael,Gabe is a fantastic host. He is reliable kind and helpful. The studio is very cozy and is in a great neighbourhood perfect for exploring SF. Could not recommend this place more!
59702,99966924,2016-09-06,91140187,Martin,"We stayed in Toby's Cottage for four nights and had a wonderful time there. 

We liked the art of Toby and her husband Joe which is present in the entire house and garden. Also we got an private tour through the studio.

We loved the hospitality the sense of humor and the long talks after having explored San Francisco. Especially the tip to get round by Uber was a great one :)

Summing it up the stay at Toby's placed made our personal San Francisco experience unique and complete.

Thank you two so much and we hope we will meet some time again."
3257886,120754583,2016-12-11,5520230,Hannah,Our stay at Kathy and Matt's place was great! The location isn't central but that makes the parking so easy! It's only about a 20-25 minute drive into the city center. The space was perfect for our group of four. We weren't able to check in until close to midnight and they were so accommodating! Matt even stayed up to meet us and say hello when we arrived. We would definitely recommend a stay here for a trip to the city!
16052484,438881861,2019-04-17,41008805,Bing,Good location less than 20 mins to SF downtown. Bathroom is beautiful. I would like to recommend this place to my friends.

14450414,98133894,2016-08-29,36584844,David,The apartment was spotless.  It was cozy and very well decorated.  The host has excellent taste and the decor is eclectic.  Bed and pillows were very comfortable.  Really nice bathroom and sweet outdoor patio.  The neighborhood is funky edgey and will capture your interest and attention.  If you're looking for Disney this isn't it.  If you want to chill in a real neighborhood with flavor grit and character - this is the spot.  Easily accessible to downtown Berkeley Sausalito etc...  
66119,14561740,2014-06-22,12949237,Onowa,Joe was very helpful from the start. He even arranged to have us check in early which was very much appreciated.

The studio was clean and comfortable the garden lovely and we enjoyed to cook in the kitchen. We would definitely stay there again. Phil is a great host and very helpful. Thank you so much. 
25662,143189542,2017-04-10,2368951,Julie,I found Gayle's place to be exactly what I needed: comfortable quiet easy to walk to cafe's restaurants and groceries.  I was attending a workshop that was an easy and affordable car share away.  At the end of each day I was really happy to have a quiet place to unwind.  I walked to nearby grocery stores to have a few supplies on hand and made it to a few of the recommended restaurants. I think Gayle's place is a great spot for visitors to stay for a few days.
2670951,55196005,2015-11-29,29508586,Jingyi,The house is really good and clean. It's feel like our own house.

Convenience to BART was a plus the nearest stop is but a block-and-a-half away.

I will definitely consider this spot if I return to SF."
4104344,327422518,2018-09-23,43579187,Michael,David’s place was fantastic for our weekend trip to SF. Walking distance from the Castro. Comfortable bed. Private bathroom. Deck outside the bedroom. Very friendly hosts. We would definitely recommend and will try to book again next visit.
1855096,513664604,2019-08-19,2365940,Ralf & Christine,Sehr netter Host! Fabelhafte Wohnung mit allem ausgestattet was man braucht für 4 Personen. Perfekte Park-Situation sehr gute Restaurants und Cafes dirkt um die Ecke. Gute Lage um in alle Richtungen auszuschwärmen um San Francisco zu erkunden. Sehr zu empfehlen.
17305040,480019146,2019-07-01,246422444,Paul,A lovely spacious and clean accomodation. Stuart is a great host providing everything you need. His place  is situated in a lovely neighbourhood with a great cafe nearby for casual drinks or full meals run by friendly staff. There is a direct  bus service 5 minutes walk away taking you directly onto Market Street in downtown SF. What more could you want; staying in a local neighbourhood but having easy access to central SF.

Would gladly stay again! :)"
19570882,198517392,2017-09-29,100619981,Sabrina,The house is cozy and super neat! Very tasteful and perfect for family trip. Nice neighborhood and close to everything.
774323,77732511,2016-06-03,34083347,Hannah,"Jan is a wonderful host and her apartment is perfectly located in the mission for exploring both the mission and the city. The apartment is in close proximity to some San Fransisco culinary delights. 
The room is very comfortable (with ensuite) - the bed is really comfy! There is a fan for warmer nights and the room is quiet if the window is open. 
Jan is very accommodating and has great knowledge of the area we really enjoyed staying here and getting to know this lovely San Fransisco local! Highly recommend."
413663,504338029,2019-08-07,194618667,Jeff Et Sylvie,Thalia est une hôte très accueillante et sympathique. Elle a su tout de suite nous mettre à l’aise et nous acculturer à la cuisine traditionnelle. Une expérience en famille à faire et une dégustation de pizzas authentiques. Elle nous a indiqué des lieux à visiter surtout les incontournables de Florence. Grazie mille Thalia :)
1725853,188484027,2017-08-29,64403012,Beth,"We had a great stay at Alex & Lina's place. It was a good location and the apartment was beautiful. We really enjoyed our trip and would definitely stay here again.

Beth & family"
748222,102229647,2016-09-17,3464321,Nicole,Michael and Yesica were wonderful hosts! Their apartment is stylish and comfortable and in a great location for exploring the city. It was super easy to get there from SFO and is only a couple of blocks away Valencia St which is full of shops restaurants and bars. The Bart station was easily accessible via 24th or 16th. You are staying in the Mission and we made it a point to get off Bart at the 16th St station when coming home late at night- there were more people around and places open which made us feel better about walking home. I highly recommend Michael and Yesica's place and would definitely stay again. You get a better city experience at a much lower rate than a hotel.
22536998,452730376,2019-05-13,8714172,David,Roomy with two private bedrooms two full baths two sitting areas with sofas dining table and a very attractive new-appearing kitchen. Good location near restaurants Golden Gate Park and public transportation. We had one problem which Vicky investigated and fixed. Would stay there again
30532741,411812983,2019-02-13,227822252,예령,Serhan's place was perfect. The bedroom was clean and spacious for two people to stay and the location is nearby almost every tourist points. Union square downtown is just two stops away from this place. There is a busstop and underground transportation stop in 5 minutes by walking and the neighborhood is very quiet during night and felt safe to walk even close to midnight. The self-checkin process was very easy too. I really enjoyed time staying in Serhan's place and highly recommend for others to stay !
1178281,9726054,2014-01-06,10890209,Zack,This was a amazing experience. If your lucky enough to stay here count yourself lucky. UCLA/Cal Bears only so Trojans stay out.
22309220,251339375,2018-04-07,69108275,Lucas,This may be the best Airbnb experience I’ve had. The room and apartment themselves were great—clean spacious and well furnished. Kirk and Nichole were quick to respond to my messages and address any issues that arose. They have snacks coffee and other small things to share which made me feel at home. They also allowed a late checkout since no one was staying the next day and I wanted to leave my luggage at the apartment until my late flight. Can’t recommend highly enough!
16706877,262668412,2018-05-09,38389965,Robert,Great response time friendly amazing little place. Super efficient clean and convenient in a quiet neighborhood.
18329172,364522230,2018-12-30,34482406,Stanley,Great place to stay. Spacious clean and stylish. We definitely enjoyed staying there for the entirety of our trip.
23054267,245531504,2018-03-22,10108922,Ariane,Amy’s apartment is fantastic! The bed pillows and sheets are super comfy. I was able to wash my clothes after being in a bunch of hotels for a work trip and it was nice to “come home and relax” ... she’s a fantastic host and makes sure you’re happy! Would definitely recommend it!
7389541,52762963,2015-11-01,2160140,Sam,Great place to stay in San Francisco! Quick walk to the beach and it's easy to get to the  center of the city in half an hour or so (the N line stop is just a minute walk away). Michelle and her husband were both very nice! I also really appreciated the strawberries and homemade cookies they provided. It's a really nice space - definitely recommended!
166771,53906964,2015-11-14,33703360,Michelle,"This was my first solo adventure using this site and Patti has set the bar high. The flat was lovely (larger than it looks) the location perfect and the little touches Patti left (tea bags for a Scot means gold!) were so sweet.

If you are lucky enough to get a yes come from Patti you are going to have a great time indeed.

Thank you so much and I would definitely recommend you to friends family and co workers passing through. Till next time xx"
8055632,71899747,2016-04-29,43050703,Chris,Emanuel is a great host who is willing to help with any questions and his crib is awesome and convenient. 20 minutes drive from all major scenery spots and parking is not a problem. The driveway is large enough to maneuver and the place is near the freeway entrance. Wifi is speedy the bedroom is clean and tidy.  If I come again I will definitely stay at Emanuel's place.
10767861,94918272,2016-08-17,6943414,Philipp,Vishal was a great host. His apartment is full equipment with all the stuff you may need during a short stay. The room fits a couple perfectly fine and has enough room for two suitcases. Vishal let us in remotely which worked perfectly fine.  When we arrived we were so tired that we fell a sleep quite early we did not hear a thing when he got back home later that night. Vishal respected our privacy and accompanied us at night. We can totally recommend stating in his apartment.
9532943,127254089,2017-01-16,30169822,Nathanaël,Great location very simple room and bathroom but there's everything you need to explore SF!
14266916,295976798,2018-07-24,166394784,Sue,This is a great B&B with plenty of space for a family plus a lovely backyard courtyard space. The location offers great coffee and restaurant options within a few blocks. Marie andLaurent were friendly and responsive hosts. We hope to stay here again.
13284332,191503243,2017-09-07,143970568,Megha,Great location if you want to enjoy all that is offered in Union Square! I am a very light sleeper so the noise of the street kept me up for a bit but my boyfriend was fine- so personal preference! Jeff was great with communication and very helpful.
795254,18744813,2014-08-31,10904543,Adam,The apartment was in an extremely convenient location in the SF. We were new to the city and the location was perfect to explore the city. Jane was an extremely good host and the attic is comfortable very nicely furnished and extremely well kept. 
19954872,286220056,2018-07-05,983504,Laurenellen,Nice location. Rooms are spacious and appear just as in listing. No frills and not the most comfortable beds in the world but you'll live. The back roof area is neat. Ching is a great communicator and seasoned host and check-in and check-out were a breeze. (Especially for a group arriving at different times!) We enjoyed our stay. Thanks!
470686,38193003,2015-07-13,16475442,David,We were allowed a very flexible check in time which helped us since we were coming in from the east coast.  Hao greeted us upon arrival and everything was exactly how it looked in the photos.  It's a really great location and very nice neighborhood.
11939561,142331836,2017-04-07,66980518,Crystal,Tiffany's apartment is perfectly comfortable and equipped for a great stay in the Mission. My husband and I enjoyed the quick walk to Bart and nearby restaurants. Tiffany has done an excellent job decorating and stocking the apartment with all the necessities. Check in and check out were quick  and easy and Tiffany was very responsive to any questions we had. I definitely recommend staying in Tiffany's apartment. We loved it!
3250486,201109048,2017-10-07,9180290,Ciara,Christian's place is lovely with great photography and art on the walls. I had a bunch of really interesting conversations with Christian. The bed was so comfortable and the room suited me perfectly. The apartment is well located and easy to access. I would highly recommend this place.
213532,69439939,2016-04-11,15786774,Nathan,The room was clean and quiet; the building was a bit rickety (but in a charming way). The two shared bathrooms were no inconvenience at all.  Room #4 was light and airy with plenty of windows.  Would definitely stay here again!
32871760,507600667,2019-08-11,15483045,Daniel,This place was great! The location is perfect—10 minute walk from BART Mission Dolores Park and a ton of restaurants. The whole apartment and backyard space felt very private and peaceful. Zoe was super easy to communicate with and check-in/out was great. Would definitely recommend as a great home base to explore San Francisco!
166199,41926131,2015-08-10,17376861,Alicia,Great place. Private clean very nice owners. Highly recommend. Will rent again. 
7483031,128166914,2017-01-22,17307569,Karl,The apartment is impeccably clean and thoughtfully organized and stocked with all you need to make a comfortable stay. Kitchen is functional for travel cooking oj water tea coffee and basic spices are all waiting. Toiletries also well stocked.  Hosts are pleasant helpful and responsive. With out being intrusive. The space itself is secure and quiet. Large comfortable beds in. It's rooms. Back yard is nice and private. Very nice experience and worked perfectly rly in conjunction with Uber to make sf trip a breeze.
21985129,502627911,2019-08-04,79258057,Autumn,Great location not too far from downtown. Perfect little place for our weekend trip with a private entrance and bathroom!
9051149,168900229,2017-07-10,839800,Bjarni,"Where to start!

I would say that experiencing Elmar’s hosting and his amazing hospitality was one of the highlits of our trip through California.
Elmer went out of his way to make us feel welcome is his house. We stayed in a guest bedroom and we connected immediately with Elmar and his wonderful Corgi London. 
Communication was super easy the house was very clean and full of anemities for us to use whether it was in the kitchen bathroom or bedroom.
Elmer is an amazing host; friendly considerate fun and caring – we couln’t give him a better recommendation!

2670951,59082358,2016-01-06,19739282,Novalena,This by far has been one of my most favorite airbnb experiences to date!  Patsy's home is filled with amazing amenities and allows you to feel like you are staying at the Fairmont:)  The home is more beautiful in person and the location has so many shops around the area you will not be in need for anything you can't have.  Uber or Lyft are great ways to get around and the home is easy for them to find.  We stayed here for our nuptials with our in-laws and they enjoyed the cozy and upgraded feeling of the home too.  I would recommend to stay here in a heartbeat and hope to return in the near future.  
12437037,273008448,2018-06-04,166917306,Amy,Sandy was very kind to accomodate a discounted rate to a couple campers looking for a last minute bed for one night in the city and her father was kind and helpful. The place was sufficient and clean though does not have any food prep facilities other than a mini fridge. Be advised that the suite is through their entrance and at the back of their garage full of personal belongings inside an old door that looks like a utility closet. There is a second door to the backyard beside the suite entrance that does not close properly. We also had someone try to open the door to our suite around 9am without knocking presumably her father who again came 15 minutes before check out to remind us of our check out time as he had new visitors already there waiting to leave their belongings. Not the highest in security and a little creepy but all in all the suite was fine and the location was great however compared to other options we would have been disappointed if we had paid full price.
32496599,438030556,2019-04-15,35151277,Jennifer,My husband and I really enjoyed staying at Debbie and Hank’s place. The location was perfect for us as we like things that are quiet. You are literally 2 blocks from the ocean and away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The neighborhood is really cute...and you can walk to restaurants like Cliff House for a romantic dinner at sunset. The space was also great as it has everything you need. The garden is fabulous and was nice to sit out there after a long day of sightseeing.   Since this place is on the west side of the city....you will need to either take the bus or Uber to get around. It’s about a $20 Uber ride to get to downtown San Francisco.
14808208,182392332,2017-08-14,19242546,Erin,Jo Anne's home looks beautiful in its pictures but it is even lovelier in person. The kitchen and bathrooms are very tastefully done and the whole home is furnished comfortably. It is much larger than I expected and we enjoyed the location very much. On the weekend that we stayed we didn't have a lot of luck with parking in the neighborhood so we opted to park at UCSF which is not inexpensive but my car was safe; since we walked everywhere or took Muni we didn't need the car anyway. Highly recommended.
23672181,546487140,2019-10-13,192313646,Raúl,Lovely place clean and tidy good comunication well located and a lot of amenities. We had an awesome stay at Andrea's place and a perfect time in SF. Totally recommended. We will come back.
25318633,368402710,2019-01-06,47580168,Rachel,Awesome location cozy apartment
4439461,153321084,2017-05-20,120116888,Julianne,Nice and close to the Fillmore. No problems finding parking. Comfy bed and very nice hosts. You can't use the tub bummer but we still had a nice time. 
1110787,92694774,2016-08-09,54956686,Richard,Amanda's apartment was our first experience of Airbnb and Amanda was very helpful offering advice on getting there. Getting in was the problem. The access code to collect the key at the keycafe would not work and tired after an 18 hour flight with my daughter unwell this was a headache I didn't need. The internet cafe was close to shutting before we finally had success. In my opinion leaving the key from a keycafe 1 mile away is not a good idea and cost us in taxis and time. The apartment was ok though too small for a family of four and the sofa bed was uncomfortable. Apart from that we had a good time in SF and the people we met were super helpful.
1767543,55601742,2015-12-03,32752778,Brian,We were very pleased with our stay.  The carriage house was clean and welcoming and the location was wonderful. Thanks!
29828791,528803804,2019-09-13,127048190,Andrea,I loved the stay here the place was sparkling clean super cute the rooftop is incredible. Everything was great!
12780009,161897376,2017-06-18,1736262,Heidi,Great option for staying in the city near Union Square. Rooms are clean new and modern and perfect for just needing a comfortable ebed and place to stay while visiting. Note - I did bring a travel iron hairdryer and shower soap but that was all the extras I needed to bring in order to make my 4 night stay perfect! 
13848713,454611230,2019-05-18,30447954,Maryjane,Dean’s place gives you the privacy that you need and a good space to come back at night after a hectic day. I will stay at Dean’s place again if given the chance. Thank you Dean.
59344,8066097,2013-10-14,2614847,Pascal,The place is clean and cozy and was the perfect choice for a weekend get-away.
32518108,506503276,2019-08-10,273973229,John,We loved staying at Danh's! The location is great! We were able to walk or take public transportation everywhere we wanted to go in San Francisco. Although Danh was away on business he responded to all our questions with helpful suggestions. We would definitely go back!
3309722,303152110,2018-08-06,134287919,Laura,This place was relaxing with a beautiful deck with a view. Felt conformable and loved the neighborhood.  Definitely wound stay here again. 
9752333,99559595,2016-09-05,2122767,Samantha,What a great space! We loved staying at Peg's. San Francisco was our last stop on our road trip and it was great to have such a lovely flat to relax in. It was a bonus to discover there was a washing machine too. The location was great and we would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting San Fran.
4105958,41217299,2015-08-05,4785299,Edward,My family stayed Paul's cosy and lovely house 3 nights. Paul prepared considerate welcome package for us and gave us very detailed introduction of his house.  We absolutely recommend this house to others. 
16073836,344088584,2018-11-02,54870195,Anna,"Very good location 
Comfiest beds ever
Well stocked house
Spotlessly clean"
598271,138368131,2017-03-19,46797516,Joel,"Great location with gorgeous views of the area the place is very charming and beautifully decorated. 
I especially loved the patio off of the east bedroom  it's great to wake up and be out there taking in the morning breeze. 

Fran is a great host with a lovely attitude and a comforting character. "
4519757,109982502,2016-10-23,26535467,Monica,Staying at this hostel was a great experience. It was clean and the staff was wonderful. A standout in my opinion was the number of bathrooms on each floor. At other hostels that I've stayed at in the past sometimes you had to wait to use the bathroom or shower. It was great that there were enough so that at least one was available to use which is really helpful when you're trying to rush out in the mornings. One thing to be aware of is that if your room is facing the street it can get a little loud at night from the partying.
14179987,502585164,2019-08-04,33151290,Sam,Clean cozy apartments in a fabulous location. The marina is the only place to be.
794626,142886163,2017-04-09,4930162,Rich,"We were doing a road trip around California and wanted somewhere in San Francisco to dump the car for a few days and explore on foot. 

Loved this place. We used a load of buses. 

The bus drivers in San Fran are really friendly. I'll never get over that. The bus drivers here in London are angry psychopaths.

We bussed to Golden Gate Bridge via the Japanese garden in Golden Gate Park (nowhere near the bridge) and across town.

We also had a go on the famous cable car. And a tram and boats. 

We also used the Bart train which is the slightly faster way down town but you meet people on buses.

Mary at the 44 stop said her father was 131 years old.

Bernal Heights is a super area to explore in its own right. And I'd recommend this apartment for families. 

The beds are probs due for an upgrade but we all five of us from 17 to 75 years old slept well. 

Justin's a great host.

It turns out I've got two Airbnb accounts thanks to a panicked 'login with (Hidden by Airbnb) ' so I never got the really helpful email from Justin in advance.

It's almost worth going back just to try the local Salvadorian diner and other nearby treats.

767506,9840279,2014-01-13,11004199,Danielle,We had a wonderful stay at the Jennifer and Chris' home.  It is conveniently located in the city with easy access to public transportation. There is an conveniently located market behind the house that has a full selection of bakery goods cheeses organic produce beer and wine. The house itself is very well suited for two couples because there are essentially two separate living spaces.  Two small families traveling together would work well too.  The house is spacious and very clean.  In addition there is driveway parking and convenient parking in the neighborhood.  Jennifer was very helpful and easy to contact during our stay. 
746079,35369741,2015-06-18,28637039,Barbara,"This was our first experience with Air BNB. We have to thank Ian to have it made wonderful ! Ian is a great host very nice and always ready to provide suggestion on the city. The house is plenty of facilities which made our stay even more comfortable and it is super nice. It is also close to the subway station- ten minutes walk which is a very pleasant one. I would high recommend it to anyone who wish to visit the city.
Thank you again Ian and TJ for everything!"
13293285,317894525,2018-09-02,160748542,Alexis,Check-in was super easy and it was nice that some basic amenities were covered. However the noise was a lot more than we expected and many of the recommendations for things to do in the area were outdated. The price felt steep for the experience.
33578,362763,2011-07-09,449771,Ludovic,Kepa and her place are absolutely great. I have enjoyed both her rentals and it has been a pleasure every time. Her meticulously kept garden and great personality make for a great stay. Furthermore after having spent some time in San Francisco I can now say that Potrero may well be my favorite area in the city. Kepa's place is within walking distance of fantastic restaurants bars and music venues. I look forward to my next stay.
19416507,420792295,2019-03-07,34766167,Elodie,We had a wonderfull stay! The room was comfortable and the appartment was well located! i ll recommand it without a blink !
748256,148941425,2017-05-01,127778823,Ziheng,Michael and Yesica's place is clean and tidy. I would go back and see the sweet couple again.
964751,70491905,2016-04-18,62557641,Carolyn,Phil your efficiency apartment is perfect for us. We love the privacy and it's very clean and comfortable. GGP is so close and using the bus was a breeze. 
442397,268347465,2018-05-24,169383726,Marty,"We are so fortunate to have discovered Marianne’s Airbnb in The beautiful sunset district of San Francisco. We were Away from the hustle and bustle of downtown San Francisco at our tranquil Avenue near the beach. It was always so refreshing to come home after being sightseers. 

Marianne gave us the grand tour of the home upon our arrival making sure that we understood where everything was to meet our needs. It was super important for us to have that parking garage space so that our vehicle was secure at the end of each day. The home itself sparkled with windows looking out onto the street and the garden area. The beds were all luxurious as were the bathrooms with each of the bedrooms having their own on suite. The kitchen was full appointed with a beautiful dishwasher eating area and picture window. We couldn’t have asked for anything more or better. It did feel like home away from home."
2539953,243649549,2018-03-16,55821896,Bobbi,Thankful for earlier check in. The house was cute and clean. There was a small issue Alexandra took care of right away and we enjoyed our stay very much. Great hospitality! $4 uber/lyft ride to Castro districts Main Street.

32549667,438886748,2019-04-17,35303481,Grace,It is very beautiful place to stay. Park just in front of the listing place itself has lots of charm too! Recommend you to stay if you want to stay in homely area.
8101297,267751777,2018-05-22,182006865,Saskia,The Location was perfect close to chestnut street and lombard street. The room was nice and clean. Anthony wrote back immediately and Check in and out was uncomplicated.
14268636,136005227,2017-03-07,97200006,Stefan,The room is nice and Jack does everything that you have a nice time. 
5749181,52102728,2015-10-26,45101315,Anabelle,The location is fantastic.  It is easily accessible to many amenities.  The owners leave you alone and the room and bathroom are comfortable.  A queen size bed and a table would make the accommodations better for a lengthier stay and the owners treading lightly upstairs between the hours of 10 pm and 8 am would make it feel more private.  I don't think they realize how loud their footsteps are downstairs and the room is located below the kitchen.  Also shades for the Windows instead of flimsy curtains that do not cover the Windows would provide more privacy and respite from the light.  For one person it is more than adequate but I would not recommend it to a couple.
18873809,418239103,2019-03-01,154561746,Nadia,Ryan and Meghan are excellent hosts. The house is very clean the bed is comfortable and we are very happy with it. The location is close to the beach coffee shop and only a short drive to the beautiful Golden Gate park. We would stay there again on our next trip to SF!

3433930,123516023,2016-12-29,96752298,Hayeon Giselle,Nice view really awesome house I ever stayed
2518781,347741291,2018-11-11,198722566,Meghan,This is  a nice cozy stylish apartment that's miles better than a hotel room.  My sister and I spent five days in San Francisco and Chris's place ending up being the perfect home base. It's right by Muni and Bart stops and a safeway for anything you may need to pick up.  It's also really close to bernal heights park where you can find amazing views of the whole city. The garden area was very cute and has a grill and a fire pit in it though we didn't use either of them while we were there. Thank you Chris for making our 2018 sister trip amazing!
4439461,233450260,2018-02-09,156236609,Diego,"The host were kind and quick to response. 
I would definitely stay here again. Everything you need is around the block no need to drive anywhere because of the free overnight parking in the parking lot literally next door."
6423158,160833607,2017-06-15,127200505,Laura,Alice is a great host and her place is a perfect location if you are looking to spend time in San Fran.  We had a rental car that we left right out front had everything we needed in the kitchen and felt completely at home safe and comfortable.  Alice communicated with us whenever we needed her and everything was perfect.  We hope to use this perfect spot again - highly recommend it!
18587279,331481786,2018-10-02,197094084,Emily,Ken's space is quiet clean and comfortable. His communication was also top notch. Thank you!
21082676,502599853,2019-08-04,60066220,Marcel,"Jonathan‘s apartment is perfectly located in the Mission District with many cafés and bars surrounding as well as supermarkets nearby. The communication between Jonathan and us was fast easy and reliable. He was a generous host who gave some great recommendations. 

Other than that our room was smaller than expected - we could not open our suitcase on the ground. Also we do not quiet agree on the previous opinions about cleanliness which should be improved due to the high pricing. 

Nevertheless we had a pleasant stay in San Francisco!"
24099463,299853025,2018-07-31,9185524,Liz,I recently visited SF for a short business trip. I booked Brian's place because of the great location in Noe Valley and it looked quite and private. I'm really glad I stayed here because this place was great! The room was really clean comfortable and stylish and it was a quiet place to get some work done. I also loved being a short walk from Philz coffee and it was very easy to get downtown by Uber. Overall this was a hassle-free and relaxing spot for a visit and I definitely plan to come back next time I'm in town!

7949668,79136016,2016-06-11,18682260,Josh,Raina was a great host the room was clean and comfortable and the location was great. My only critique is that there should have been a mention that the bathroom is shared with another room that is rented out and that if there is no access to kitchen that basic dishes be provided.

32747602,488949753,2019-07-15,254207993,Kelli,"This is a great place to stay during to experience San Francisco.  There are a multitude of ethnic grocery stores shops and restaurants in walking distance and Golden Gate Park Lands End and Ocean beach just a short drive away.  The off street parking was wonderful and accommodated our rented mini van without any issue! 
The space is a typical finished lower level of a SF row house nicely done clean and cozy.  The beds are comfy.  The style is eclectic but functional.  
Be prepared: summer weather not summer like in SF 65 deg F is the normal high temp.  
We will definitely stay here again for our next family visit."

This Airbnb location is superb close to everything (restaurants touristic spots and shops) and a twenty minutes walk to Embarcadero. I highly recommend this place and would stay here again 100%.
4670847,36705391,2015-06-30,33470549,John,The experience at this listing was wonderful. The rooms and provided amenities were clean and tidy. The beds were comfortable to use and the common area was great for meeting new people. Breakfast is provided and a full kitchen with refrigerator space is available for all guests. The location is wonderful right between the Italian district and Chinatown so there are many good restaurants within walking distance. The listing was always safe and the staff always made us feel at ease. A+ experience.

Elizabeth was a great host. We really appreciated the time we had with her and the dog Schneider:)

If you wanna stay in a cool area in a nice house that your address. 

If we ever come back to San Francisco we make sure to visit Elizabeth.

Thank you for everything :)

24723,146960,2010-11-30,159169,Trudie,Great location and very welcoming hosts. We were very happy with our stay in Bush Street. It was easy to get around and Steve and Cynthia were very helpful (thank you). Apartment was well kept and the shower pressure is just fine (refer to previous reviews). You can hear the noise upstairs but it was not loud and mostly we were unaware of any noise. We stayed with two young boys and they were happy with the apartment as well. Thank you to Steve and Cynthia.
2455313,49588034,2015-10-05,9488920,Katie,I've been touring for almost 2 years and have stayed in 21 Airbnbs. This is hands down the best place I've ever stayed in.  Jaysa is an AMAZING host. When we first were looking at this house it was a three bedroom. When Jaysa realized that we were four girls she offered to open up her office and turn it into a fourth bedroom which was very comfortable.  Pictures are just as described.  Every night we would come home from work and gather around the huge kitchen island have a glass of wine or tea.  We used the dining room had a friends over in the gorgeous back courtyard area.  The neighbors were very nice to us they even invited us to the Elsie St. block party.  The house efficiently uses space. It seems small from the outside but is quite large inside.  Jaysa is incredibly organized and very easy to communicate with even being all the way on the east coast for the majority of our stay.  Jaysa's mother and brother were around to help us with the other small issues.  The neighborhood is beautiful plenty of public transportation and the top of Bernal hill is just a few blocks away (if you can handle the steep walk up!)  Cortland street right around the corner provided us a great neighborhood grocery restaurants bars and even a dog wash for my pups which Jaysa graciously allowed to stay!  In the last week one of the girls was having trouble sleeping and Jaysa got her a new mattress!  It would have been easier to just say tough it out but Jaysa has such integrity she got the new mattress to us in a very short time.  we also saved so much money by staying in this house together.  there is only one thing to mention that wasn't super awesome:  like most SF housing there was no A/C which is fine for most of SF weather but the room on the 2nd floor bedroom got warm during the few days above 85.  However the rest of the house stayed really cool with fans and drawing the shades.  The other beds were comfortable and the kitchen a dream. I cannot recommend this place enough! Jaysa and her team made us feel so welcome!  We loved it we didn't want to leave. Thank you Jaysa!  Will be back to this one if we come through SF again!  
7949624,477576558,2019-06-28,22414982,Shap,The host canceled this reservation 51 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

8101297,313098735,2018-08-24,30345885,David,I had a fantastic stay at Anthony's place. The private room was very clean and organized. Anthony was a great host and was very accomdating. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at his place. 
1336998,535598679,2019-09-24,8018834,Anna,Dough and Richard are very friendly generous and helpful hosts. The room is big and the bed great. The shared bathroom is nice and fresh. We loved their little garden wich we very generously could use. The household  includes two cute and very cuddly cats. Great location too close to cosy resturants and the bus to town.
6107359,106716636,2016-10-07,4397659,Dave,"Pete was the consummate host. We arrived with easy ""check in"" instructions and were impressed by the clean and recently renovated apartment. Although I wish the TV was in a common space instead of the bedroom it really was a lovely stay I would definitely stay here again."
3030653,15868304,2014-07-17,15933423,Christina,We had a great time in San Francisco. The studio is perfectly located - lots of bars and restaurants in walking distance however very quiet at night. It looked exactly the same as on the pictures everything was clean and welcoming. Lindsay is a great host everything went smooth from booking to checkout. We would definitely stay here again. 
845501,148932011,2017-05-01,118977215,Jonathan,"Everything was ok. Delores answered very very quickly.
Perfect Place to go to San Francsico. It is nearby with Car and also with Bus and Bart. 

Gute Unterkunft um San Francisco zu erkunden. Nicht direkt im Zentrum aber eine gute Anbindung an die Stadt. Die Bushaltestelle ist 3 Minuten entfernt und dann muss nur nochmal in die Bart umgestiegen werden. Mit dem Auto ist die Stadt auch wunderbar zu erreichen. Das Haus liegt in einer ruhigen und sicheren Gegend ist jedoch schon einige Jahre alt. Da man ja aber eh die meiste Zeit unterwegs ist ist das kein Problem. "
18359884,179552761,2017-08-07,141262730,Isabella,"This was my first time staying in an Air BnB and it completely exceeded all of my expectations. Gonzalo is an incredible host. He checked in on us and how we were doing made sure we had everything we needed and continually went above and beyond when it came to being a host. 
As for the place itself the decor and location were both stunning and perfect. It's about a short 20 minute walk to Tartine Bakery Bi Rite Creamery Mission Dolores Park the Haight and some of the best spots to visit in the city. 
When I come back to visit again this place is definitely #1 on my list. "
10099733,123119971,2016-12-27,103713925,Tristin,Convenient place with comparatively low price
11297447,63317123,2016-02-21,2321633,Johan,Wonderful hostel in one of SF's best districts. The host was very welcoming and helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. The place is extremely cozy and the other guests where really friendly. Will stay here again!
26095551,450972966,2019-05-10,208605459,Meshale,Aarons place was absolutely beautiful! You wake up to an amazing view of Twin Peaks! The sunlight shines so much light into the apartment bringing to full illuminance of the modern space. Communication was great hospitality was spectacular and the bedrooms were very comfortable! I loved the space and the neighborhood. Thanks Aaron!
7331464,247240434,2018-03-27,120622407,Diane,Noe Valley is a quaintsafe place to stay when seeing SF. The hosts were wonderful and easy to communicate with. Their property is clean and updated walking distance to everywhere!
14058613,213373081,2017-11-20,54006915,Nadya & Elena,Fantastic stay. The location is so central - we just walked everywhere. The apartment itself is very spacious tastefully decorated and has everything one might need. Highly recommend and will definitely stay here again.
7009654,404350904,2019-01-23,40984518,Sergio,We were a couple hosted in this place and we really enjoyed its location is very quiet there are small restaurants where to have good food around the hill is not very steep and there are very good connections with public transport (bus and subway) which we really appreciated. The room has all the necessary to have a good rest but there is no heating system and it was cold every time we arrived at night however an electric heater provided worked well although it would take time until we felt comfortable. Glenn and his family are amazing hosts he is indeed a very easy airbnb guy (I made a mistake in my reservation and he solved it without any additional charge) we would definitely come back. Thanks a lot for all!
1434425,55786869,2015-12-06,28368124,Paulina,"The room is even cuter and cozier than the picture. The bed is HUGE and super comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay here especially with Gabe (the adorable bull dog) and the rain shower :) 
David was super welcoming and went out of his way to explain to us how to get around the city (via MUNI) and where to visit. He had a drawer full of maps and tour guides for us to use. The listing is centrally located to everything right in the heart of the Castro community which is super safe and lively. The F-line and Bart takes us everywhere we wanted to go and only 2 blocks away. A lot of food places were within walkable distance (less than 15 min)."
8869066,349227863,2018-11-16,120712201,Thomas,Very accurate description. The place is very clean and in a nice quiet neighborhood about a 20 minute walk to the heart of the Mission.

Matt & Grace are very kind hosts with good tips around the city!
beautiful terrace which we could unfortunately not really use because it was a bit too cold outside.. but I image it to be wonderful in warm summer nights :)"
4526608,130385640,2017-02-05,23188373,Nik,"Chris and Tex's guest room was great! It was clean and quaint with a hip retro SF vibe. We were 3 of us and we're very comfortable in the beds they provided. The bathroom for our private room was clean and well stocked with all the essentials. 

Chris and Tex have thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. They have a fridge coffee maker microwave utensils glasses and coffee creamer and sugar! They've even got a washer and dryer for your clothes and also gave us towels for our use. Their wifi worked great. 

The location was safe - we had our car parked on the street for free on the weekend and had no issues whatsoever. The location is not far from downtown SF and easily accessible by Uber. They've got maps and instructions on how to use public transport as well. Chris and Tex were easily accessible for any questions or concerns and helped us have a great time in their house. 

I have no complaints and only good words to say about our stay there. "
6938818,113016740,2016-11-09,4830335,Johannes,"The room was good - nothing to complain about but you need to know if you planing on cooking at this place you get the feeling that cooking is not really appreciated.

14938407,122603854,2016-12-24,76580078,Fahad,Victor sent the move in instructions a couple of days before arrival. I got in touch with him since I misplaced the email and he was prompt in his reply. The place was as advertised with a really nice common area and fully equipped kitchen. There are only 2 bathrooms shared among guests in the entire house so it can get a little crowded especially if there are a lot of ladies but that's okay. We really enjoyed the place and would stay here again!
30128798,448081149,2019-05-04,69115343,Dang,Rob’s place was absolutely amazing. Great spot in mission super convenient to get everywhere. He offered us amazing hospitality and a great place to spend our week long vacation. 100% would recommend and we hope to come back one day.

Easy check-in and room which was very comfortable.  House is spacious and beautifully decorated and since we were there on the weekend parking was easily accessed and free.  Since it was such a nice evening we walked over 3 miles to friend's house and dinner reservations downtown and took Uber back to Maria's house late night.  We would highly recommend Maria's place for anyone visiting San Francisco.

3311711,259284910,2018-04-30,14975397,Hayley,This was the absolute perfect place to stay in SF. I'm so happy we picked it! Their home is so incredibly beautiful with plants every where and colorful decor. I felt relaxed and inspired immediately. The bed was super comfy everything was clean. The location is close to the bart and everything fun in the mission very walkable. There were lots of clear instructions for everything which was very nice and also suggestions for places to eat and explore! I loved the natural light in the bedroom and private bath. I also really appreciated how we were allowed to leave our bags there after checkout for the day and come back at night to get them. I can't say enough great things definitely stay here!!!
9909627,154690135,2017-05-25,32770825,Jennifer,Great location for us as we were visiting relative nearby. Flat was as advertised and worked well for 5. Loved the deck and made flat feel bigger. We have tall people and shower head was perfect height. 
21964157,450945409,2019-05-10,231708131,Zonglin,Wing’s place is amazing and it’s my best Airbnb experience so far. She is so hospitality and gives us a lot of tips while we live here. Whenever I have a question she would always response very quickly. Another thing I have to mention is that Wing prepared free food and milk before we arriveour flight was pretty late and we didn’t have dinner by the time we arrive. It’s so considerable of her to do that for us.
1738415,86809896,2016-07-17,49225088,Melissa,An amazing flat an amazing host a real place to call home. Donna's little SF flat in the Hayes Valley was in a prefect location and as great as the SF sites were our best time was Saturday morning on Hayes St. Having a full kitchen an extra toilet plus all the little extras Donna provided made our stay for a family of three comfortable and so easy. I would highly recommend this great place to stay to anyone and would definitely return when we come back to SF.
909063,24420358,2014-12-28,23651446,Barbara,Mark and Rafael were friendly and helpfull. And the room and Apartement were exactly as discribed: cosy clean and quiet. It was a pleasure staying there.

21812815,470920124,2019-06-16,171082051,Montana,We loved our stay in this neat little suite! It was great to be able to go in and out as we pleased. It was very quiet and we loved staying in the Richmond District/Golden Gate Park area to be in a bit quieter area of the city with easy access to everything. The place comes with everything you need and is very clean. The bed is a little noisy so maybe not best for super light sleepers but was comfy enough! Checking in was a breeze with the detailed check in instructions from Aaron. We never had the pleasure of meeting the property owners but it was very nice to come and go as we pleased and know they were eager and available if we needed anything. Overall it was a fantastic stay and we’d definitely recommend it!
20070540,294953967,2018-07-22,132225378,Bernard,"First of all I’ll give the Airbnb host this the view was amazing. Nice view of the city and a comfy bed so when you wake up it’s just amazing! Although the listing was a bit misleading. I purposely picked this spot because the amenities listen “Free Parking on Premise”. When we arrived I was told I need too look for street parking after I was parked in front of their garage. I know parking can be a hassle in San Francisco so that was my #1 reason for picking this spot. 

My other issue is that the walls were EXTREMELY thin... like so thin you can hear their baby playing with toys in the room above you at 7am. I understand some people wake up early but 7am is a bit rude when you have guests who are PAYING to stay there.  Every morning there was some banging or movement that woke me and my girlfriend up either it was their kid or some type of furniture being moved. 

Another issue I had was being charged $47 cleaning fee. This was fine but when I paid that amount I expect to be able to wear shoes and not have to take them on and off when entering the house. Their living quarters are on a completely separate floor so it’s not like I would track dirt or mud into their personal living space.

29678261,548445544,2019-10-17,87342200,Anders,In general I think Airbnb should be a site for private appartments and not hotels. The Fairmont hotel is nice - but to pricey.
3759246,277577934,2018-06-16,43382130,Brittany,A very cozy place with perfect parking space included! David family and a Jeff the corgi were extremely hospitable and kind. Offered great suggestions for nearby food as we arrived pretty hungry. The bed was very comfortable and the sitting area was also really nice to have. Thanks again!

3850,17544470,2014-08-13,19709979,Sebastian,"This was our first experience using Airbnb and staying at Kevin's house was a perfect beginning.

The house was very clean spacious comfortable and quiet. The house is situated in a upper-midle class neighborhood with public transportation closed to touristic attractions (Twin Peaks: Great city views during the day and night Golden Gate Park Japanese Tea Garden Botanical Garden and more).

We arrived by car and we were able to park on the street just in front of kevin's house. 

Finally we would like to mention how good we felt having Kevin as a Host. Immediately after booking the room we contacted Kevin and jointly planned the arrival as we were coming from the Yosemite National Park getting to the house around 11 pm. He waited for us to provide all the instructions needed. 

If you were looking for a place to stay in San Francisco I would definitely recommend to stay at Kevin's house.

A nuestra familia le encanto todo: las habitaciones el baño y en especial la cocina: esta super equipada para hacer comida propia y esto nos ayudo mucho en el gasto diario. Stacie es una excelente anfitriona... y la gata es muy amigable y limpia.

Gracias Stacie nos ayudaste mucho tienes una casa encantadora y tu amabilidad nos alegro mucho en SFO. Si volvemos esperamos quedarnos de nuevo en tu casa. 


The house has an excellent location. It takes about 20 minutes to the union square. Our family loves the house: bedrooms the bathroom and specially the kitchen. It is well equipped and we were able to prepare our food. Stacie is a great host ... and the cat is charming and friendly. 

Thanks Stacie for all your help while we stayed in San Francisco. You have such a charming house. Next time in SF we will stayed there."

I'm glad I stayed here!

Nous partageons la cuisine ce qui permet de rencontrer du monde d’autres nationalités présents dans la maison.  Maison très bien situé à côté du Golden Gate Park à côté d’un arrêt de bus et à un bloc d’un arrêt de tram qui vont tout les deux dans le centre de San Francisco.

4902444,433527449,2019-04-06,200177023,Mikio,The Green Tortoise Hostel is a great budget place to stay for those looking to meet fellow travelers. The open common room and daily events offer the ideal avenues for quick friendship building and virtually everyone staying at the hostel is excited to meet new people. The staff is extremely welcoming and are quick to offer suggestions about things to do. The bathrooms are new and clean the beds are large enough and there are no concerns about noise within the rooms (although my room did not face the street). There is breakfast in the morning snacks throughout the day and even a free dinner on Friday nights.
32487296,431344452,2019-03-31,38848266,Dick,Had a great stay the place was clean and as advertised. Extremely close to the beach and Golden Gate Park. Worked perfectly for our stay.

13293285,295596874,2018-07-23,188881066,Chris,A very small space but we needed a place to sleep and a place to shower. This mini-studio provided both nicely. The fold-down bed was fine for two.
5905530,425623905,2019-03-18,58524644,Jacob,Lovely place close to so many cool things. Sharman was always available if I had any questions about places to grab a quick bite or check out the area. I felt like I was staying at a relative's place!
503362,23813201,2014-12-11,22695457,Ewan,"The pictures don't really do this property justice it's fantastic! It's also a very large very comfortable place to call home (albeit temporarily). I stayed here with a work colleague who had never used AirBnB and he was blown away by the level of luxury and location all for less that a hotel room would have been he's now a convert!

We found the place spotless and as described and Arthur the host made sure we had all the relevant info to gain access as well as some local info etc. There's even a bike to use should you wish.

If it's available I'll stay here on my next trips to the city."
4948327,31858150,2015-05-10,32299805,Anupam,The room was clean and good as shown in the pictures. Budi is a very polite and friendly person. He gave us his personal parking space to park our car  The location of the house was quite good. 15mins drive from the downtown. Quite close to the Golden Gate Bridge. The few things that  can be improved are cleanliness of the house ( apart from our room that was clean) and the washroom the bath was blocked.
9256506,237947057,2018-02-24,43496254,Kate,This a gem! It is a little homey oasis in the middle of a big city stay! We were there on business and my only regret is that we didn’t have more time to enjoy the stunning terraces and views.  David and Pam are an absolute delight! We will hope to stay again!!

Recuerden decirle sobre la calefacción ya que en la noche la bajan y se pone realmente helado."
467507,58278763,2016-01-02,44219211,Fernanda,We stayed in Jennifer's apartment for 4 nights. She received us very well and gave us some information about the house and the neighborhood. Jennifer also left some very organized printed material about the house which was very useful to us. Everything in the house worked perfectly and we felt like home. The only exception was the heating. The house does not have a central heating but a portable one which takes some time to heat up the apartment. The neighborhood is very nice and it is walking distance from Mission District and the subway. 
585326,250623235,2018-04-05,161978693,Kristina,The location is great if you are planning to go to the golden gate park. The neighborhood is very quite. There were shampoo soup tea and coffee which surprised us since we planned to buy our own. The sheets were not so clean but since we stayed for only 2 nights we didn’t have the time to really notice. Checking in and out was very easy and Su is really responsive and nice.
10251,28750,2010-03-08,85532,Lori,We had wonderful experience staying at Roman and Sarah's. The apartment was lovely and comfortable and the hosts both unobtrusive and helpful Would recommend this great alternative to hotels to anyone.
631635,3479541,2013-02-05,3375065,Cameron,"What a fantastic apartment! Betty's place is in a great location with stunning views of the Castro and downtown. The apartment is walking distance to the Castro and Noe Valley areas (and the number 24 bus is your friend on San Francisco's steep streets!)

The living room a gorgeous wodd-panel-lined sanctuary; the kitchen and bathroom are both great and the bedroom is roomy and comfortable.

Betty is super-friendly and very helpful.

Highly recommended!"
6224858,246101515,2018-03-24,10226005,Phoebe,My family and I stayed at Elisabeth and James' beautiful house over our spring break. We wanted a home base in San Francisco from which to visit friends around the bay area. We were delighted by the charm and style of this house which felt very much like a home away from home for us. In fact our daughter was thrilled to find many of the same toys and books that she loves from her room back home. The house is very comfortable including cosy bedding a fully stocked kitchen with freshly sharpened knives and a lovely outdoor play space for kids.
142177,44901687,2015-08-30,4881192,Sunil,Our family of four had a great stay at Noreen's. Our 7- and 4-year old had the space they needed to blow off energy at the end of a day of sightseeing. The location was quiet and perfect for a family.  Noreen was quick to give us some great food suggestions (which was our main reason to come to SF). We will definitely stay there again next time we're in town.

26277460,498997345,2019-07-30,226486626,Stephen,I can’t recommend this place enough. It’s a fantastic place in a very cool part of town. It was our family’s first trip to San Francisco and staying at Kim’s place made the experience so much better. Great view of the city. Close to some cool restaurants. The Excelsior neighborhood is my type of place.  The only downside as mentioned in other reviews is parking. Yeah it can be tough but it’s a city. Where is parking good in any city?
2420887,368385871,2019-01-06,17893966,Ian,Really fantastic place to stay comfy bed great location well kept kitchen and the best shower in the west. A gem.

2022751,21934962,2014-10-26,20407133,Haile,David made our stay super smooth. My band drove up from LA to play a show in SF.. we were exhausted when we pulled in. David left the keys in a secure and easy place to grab and make ourselves comfortable. His place was beautiful and allowed us room for 6 people. 
13606695,100496737,2016-09-09,438265,Vitor,Excellent place. The pictures are very accurate. Great decor on the room and bathroom! The separate entry is excellent. It's like having your own little house. Would definitely stay here again.
3114387,44799219,2015-08-29,4215356,Dane,"Julie's apartment was a great base for my friends and I to explore the city from. It was clean comfortable and conveniently located. It's an easy walk to the ocean and Golden Gate Park and a quick tram into the center.

The only negative was that the wifi was pretty slow and patchy. It wasn't a big deal for us but could be frustrating if you needed to get work done or something. 

Overall a good experience. Recommended!"
3112427,474082662,2019-06-22,216899906,Mary,I really enjoyed staying in this studio- very comfortable private and in a great neighborhood. I highly recommend this place!

2160504,249777312,2018-04-02,5078512,Susan,Great location for public transportation into the heart of SF. Carlos was very helpful and answered my questions about public transportation. I really enjoyed my first visit to San Francisco. I know it won't be my last. Hopefully I will be able to stay with Will and Carlos again.
15985008,198244118,2017-09-28,89383673,Jian,The apartment is comfortable and in a quiet neighbourhood which is ideal if you want to escape the busy city at the end of the day. Getting to central SF is easy enough on public transport as there's a bus stop just opposite the apartment which will connect you with the metro system. (Tip: the bus is every 30 mins so time your journey accordingly and if you are travelling back after 9pm you need to ask the driver when you board to make your stop as the apartment's area is request only after this time). The apartment has everything you need but one improvement would be to improve the bed which is a bit small for two people (there's lots of space for a bigger one). Also some blinds on the door to block the morning light is worth considering.
5154367,317197100,2018-09-01,4436802,Scott & Rachel,We had such a lovely stay here. The place was stylish cozy and clean. Dayne and his dog (moxie) were lovely hosts. Would recommend this place!
12291658,341392270,2018-10-26,13640787,Bethany,Everything was great - James was helpful pre-checkin and very accommodating with letting us get into the place a bit early.  The location is great and super central to get most places in SF.  Overall it's a quiet apartment and we didn't have any issues throughout the month.
678556,5481428,2013-07-02,4722514,Peter,Me and my girlfriend had a very plesant stay at Lorraines house. Lorraine was a perfect host and helped us with everything so that we could enjoy our holliday. I strongly recommend Lorraine to everyone that plans on staying in San Fransisco. If you see this please give Pablo a treat from us :)
4052091,337576059,2018-10-16,113092174,Helen,Superb place to stay. Tom and Beth were excellent hosts.
1945508,533528667,2019-09-21,16919743,Jeesun,I had the best time in San Francisco thanks to Julie and her hospitality! I was in San Francisco for work and stayed at Julie’s place for about a week. Everything was seamless from check-in to check-out. Julie was a wonderful host. She was always available for any questions that I had about her place or San Francisco in general. She also provided breakfast and lots of snacks. Her place looks much better in real life than the pictures she posted within the airbnb listing. It’s clean and in walking distance to many great areas including restaurants and yoga classes. From well lit room with the most comfortable bed to the bathroom that got everything you need (2 hair dryers shampoo conditioner travel sized facial cleanser and more) I felt very welcomed and safe. I will definitely stay at Julie’s again next time I visit San Francisco.
21476067,279483612,2018-06-20,122744233,Rebecca,This is a very comfortable attractive flat in a super location close to restaurants and shops  and an easy walk or Uber ride to many SF neighborhoods.  We stayed with our twentyish son for four days and found it perfect for him and us.  We’d definitely and gladly stay here again.  
3030653,17930375,2014-08-19,5552616,Christoffer,Lindsay and Nicole were great hostesses who greeted us with cable car tickets and a lot of great tips for restaurants in the neighbourhood. Great place to stay overall walking distance to many great locations and restaurants and just a couple of blocks from Bart & Muni-stations. The apartment was very clean and newly renovated. Highly recommended. 
10126716,470996957,2019-06-16,8367475,Sarah,Great location clean home and a nice open kitchen living room space. I would consider the place more of a 1 bathroom home though as the 2nd half bath did not have a sink (it was just a toilet). There was also quite a lot of their personal items left out. Overall we had a great time and the host was very helpful in making sure we had everything we needed.
12857179,89234317,2016-07-27,17663782,Abdullah,"Great atmosphere

30374499,354127343,2018-11-30,18918735,Shamsheer,Brent and his roommates were great hosts. Fun mix of personalities and the location is great! Super central and the room is awesome too. It's clean big and comfy. Would definitely recommend! This is a great modern place with a great kitchen if you're the type of traveler who likes to cook a few meals.
284117,105989690,2016-10-03,69007602,Arzu,Samantha en haar partner waren zo lief! Ze respecteren je privacy maar zijn er ieder moment voor je om al je vragen te beantwoorden.  We kwamen er maar niet uit toen we pizza wilden bestellen. Sam heeft ons hierbij geholpen en heeft zelfs gebeld naar de pizzeria voor ons. Ook mochten we onze koffers bij haar laten toen we gingen uitchecken (onze vlucht was pas later in de avond). De omgeving is zeer betrouwbaar en rustig. Leuke lokale restaurantjes en een heerlijke ijssalon (Mitchell's Ice Cream) in de buurt! Echt een aanrader. Wij zouden hier zo weer kunnen verblijven. Samantha (&partner) heel erg bedankt voor een heerlijke afsluiting van onze mooie rondreis West-Amerika!
30323970,489944845,2019-07-17,136822710,Carlos,The stay was great dint have any issues and we were not bothered at all. I highly recommend staying here the place was clean. The only issue I have was the parking even though that not the host fault at all. Be prepared to park a few blocks away and read the parking restrictions to avoid getting a ticket.
2124182,19528955,2014-09-14,19324985,Alan,"Lucy and I had an excellent te at Eduardo's apartment in San Francisco. Potrero Hill is a great base to explore the city from

There are some great cafes and restaurants within a very short (steep) walk and a nice store called Good Life Grocery that gave us everything we needed

1855096,14239084,2014-06-15,9993802,Christy,My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at Mike's San Francisco flat! It was truly a perfect experience!! The flat was VERY clean very well decorated and located in a nice neighborhood with great local restaurants. In addition Mike was the ultimate host! He stocked the flat with everything we could need paid close attention to all the little details and so graciously had orange juice fresh fruit and english muffins in the kitchen for us. Hands down the perfect experience and I would highly recommend his flat! Thank you again Mike for your hospitality!!

2074584,45269254,2015-09-01,20414385,Dayten & Kristie,"Autumn and Richie really are attentive hosts. They stock the apartment with everything you could need from kitchenware to toiletries if you forget anything most likely it is already here. They are very accessible by phone or text. 

Very cozy and we loved the skylights in the living room and shower!

Although the neighborhood can feel a bit sketchy we felt 100% safe and secure once inside. Parking can be a challenge plan accordingly. "

The place is a pretty decent Mission-style house. The cats are generally well-behaved and the place itself is quite homely and open. Jess and Seb are also very flexible with people staying on longer if they need any more time.

6557736,109700276,2016-10-22,72535256,Katie,The place was very nice. Paul also provided helpful brochures and a handy sheet telling you how to get to popular tourist destinations by public transport and had clearly thought about what tourists would most likely want.

9752333,358264478,2018-12-13,8869769,David,The place is as pictured very spacious and perfect for one or two people. Check in was simple as was check out. I know it was close to public transportation however we didn't use it and took Lyft's everywhere. Looking out into a green space is unique in San Francisco. Note the place is the basement of the house and not a detached unit.
6092596,64511336,2016-03-05,6847461,Tracy,The apartment has an amazing location in the heart of the mission close to public transport Dolores park and lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. If you're a light sleeper you may want to pack ear plugs. Even though it is a pretty quiet street the occasional traffic and/or garbage collection can be heard from the apartment. The place was easy to get to and Marc was very responsive and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again!
8308630,80506759,2016-06-18,61597295,Ryan,Great neighborhood and Dominic and Sarah were great hosts. Three three of us had a great time would love to stay there the next time we are in SF.

I would definitely recommend staying here.

A cama e o chuveiro são excelentes a televisão possui diversos canais disponíveis e o anfitrião deixou algumas gentilezas como chá café e sabonete líquido. O anfitrião é muito simpático e acessível. Todos os horários combinados foram respeitados. Usamos somente o transporte público e tivemos facilidade de deslocamento na cidade pois o apartamento tem fácil acesso a transporte público. O bairro é residencial bem tranquilo e silencioso. Gostamos muito da estadia!

The beach is right across the street and there is a charming cafe within walking distance.

I highly recommend it as a place to stay!

1110787,532399301,2019-09-19,199987313,Karina,I really liked this apartment and the safe neighborhood. The apartment is very pretty and clean and there is everything you need especially it you want to cook some meals at home. There are plenty of shops bars and restaurants in walking distance or you can take the bus to go somewhere else.  (Line 1 every 5 minutes) For public transport I recommend the muni App or the clipper card  if you stay a little bit longer.  I had a really good time in San Francisco  thanks Amanda! Greetings from Germany  Karina
23551835,446551021,2019-05-01,49275506,Sean,A very good value for the location.

4464347,142325632,2017-04-07,111648017,Darrell,"The Green Tortoise was an ""happy mistake"". The hostel was quite different than what I expected seeing as I'd never been to a hostel before but the summer camp coed sort of living style turned out to be very enjoyable. What's more this particular hostel does a great job at offering activities to help bring its occupants together as well as offering plenty of info on attractions in the area."
2564006,206486864,2017-10-25,18230112,Mo,Great place and a fantastic host!
911029,13873426,2014-06-07,11341248,Dirk,My family stayed in Dan's wonderful apartment for two weeks and they loved it! The building is most likely a recent remodel as everything is new and contemporary in style. The apartment itself has all amenities it is beautifully decorated in great condition and the views are spectacular. The neighborhood is residential quiet and very pretty. Dan has been a really nice host. We have communicated several times and he has always been responsive and forthcoming. We would definitely like to come back.
256148,206725748,2017-10-26,26889001,Shaun,I had an amazing stay at Chris’s place. The room is spacious impeccably clean and stocked with every amenity you might need. The apartment is in a great location for the Castro neighbourhood and easy to get around the city from. Chris is a wonderful host who provided plenty of local recommendations and was very quick and easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay again.
3718865,21022040,2014-10-09,22196454,Mary,Katie was wonderful. Last minute plan felt like it  had been in the works for weeks. Easy. Home comfortable  everything we needed. On site parking the best! Recommended highly!
13021568,145904959,2017-04-20,79760263,Andri D,The room was exactly as advertised; spacious clean with large bathroom large TV even much better than we expected. We are a family of four and Peihong prepared 2 extra beds to accommodate. There's kitchen we could use provided with eggs cereals milk bread fruits complete utensils etc. and a washing machine on the ground floor. We mainly used Uber taxis to go around as my children are still young and normally the Uber came in very short time. Peihong is really the best host she's really nice and helpful and kept asking if there's anything she could help. She put chocolates in the room and even gave fruit platter to my daughter at night. When we left she again gave my daughter chocolates and couple boxes of chocolate sticks. We were really impressed with her personality and really felt at home! Will definitely go back here in our future visit to SF and will recommend it to everyone!!
5217164,70518818,2016-04-18,493143,Scotty,Dale's place was great. Comfortable stylish with easy street parking. Couldn't have asked for more.
17010389,344509013,2018-11-03,5665760,Zach,Carl was a very welcoming host and we would highly recommend staying here. The place has a rooftop which makes for a great spot to have your morning coffee. Rosemary will keep you company as well if you are a cat lover.
7788844,321112410,2018-09-09,149130177,Stephanie,It was a pleasure to stay at Gil’s place. Although the unit is a bit further from downtown SF (about 20 min drive) this unit was a great value (you get two bedrooms at a great price!) and the interior was very cozy. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and we had all the amenities we needed. Do expect that the neighborhood isn’t the best and you can hear some noises from upstairs occupants but we felt safe during our entire stay.
15453636,238760831,2018-02-26,108938438,Sabrina,Danielle's place was great! The room was really nice and I like the privacy we had even thought it's a shared home. The closest BART station was only a five minute walk super convenient. We had a great stay I also thought it was very thoughtful how we were supplied with coffee tee and water. Thanks again Danielle!
33969322,555616083,2019-10-27,175549451,Eduardo,Great place to stay for the price. Wish their check-out process was a bit better/seamless.

21935870,448070241,2019-05-04,28188977,Michael,Olivia and Dan's place was impeccably clean and spacious. It had a warm homely feel to it from the toiletries and soft towels to the courtyard and its quiet surrounds. At the end of our stay Dan gave us a lift to downtown to pick up our rental car. The proximity to many attractions was a bonus and the local eateries were all within walking distance.A highly recommended place to stay whether you are there for a weekend or for overseas visitors as we were.
21187925,340404768,2018-10-23,141866497,Rachel,A great space in San Fran. 10 min walk to the tram (tourists buy your clipper card from Walgreens). Loads of room for two! Really enjoyed our time in San Fran
307837,7148249,2013-09-08,4319188,Danila,Ellen is charismatic easy-going and caring host. She provided everything I possibly needed and the place is very nice with great kitchen and  beautiful garden.  Highly recommended. 
1740537,23101216,2014-11-23,12638966,Cory,Jo's Dolores Garden Apartment  was perfect for our stay in SF. We had four folks in our group and had plenty of room. The place was very clean and in a perfect location. We were able to walk to various spots throughout the Mission. Jo was more than accommodating and was very responsive to all our questions and inquiries. I highly recommend staying here. 
3081560,26245914,2015-02-08,24525117,Meredith,This was a wonderful place to stay!  Amy was friendly and helpful and the suite is lovely:  very spacious flooded with natural light and warm and cozy.  Everything was absolutely immaculate with many extra luxuries (e.g. heated floor in the bathroom super-thick towels household wi-fi).  It was great to discover Amy's many considerate touches from beer in the fridge to gourmet chocolate and snacks.  The location is ideal: a fairly quiet street with all kinds of great restaurants shops & BART within a few blocks.  We would love to stay here again and highly recommend it to others.

2349483,254931924,2018-04-18,507125,Emilio,"Cannot say enough about this Airbnb experience. Frances Dave Casey and Bowie are a wonderful family and likely the most welcoming people in San Francisco. The room is spacious with a private bathroom and the bed is truly ""the best bed in the house"". I strongly recommend this location to anyone visiting San Francisco. Outstanding hosts and space."
11345707,236278239,2018-02-18,84055455,Sloane,Michael went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay including ensuring the cottage was incredibly clean. providing complimentary snacks and drinks and sharing tips of places and restaurants to visit nearby. The cottage is located in such a cute area with some great food + it's a quick BART or UBER ride to get to where you want to go throughout San Francisco. Definitely one of our favorite AirBnB experiences!
22946959,476229593,2019-06-25,218396346,Suresh,Ahmed is great host and the studio was near the busy Haight Ashbury street and in walking distance to everything.
713877,510239836,2019-08-15,53155476,Valerie,"L'appartement est constitué de 2 pièces plus une salle de bain avec une grande douche.
L'appartement est sous les toits au dernier étage avec une terrasse privée qui offre une très belle vue. Nous y étions au mois d'aout lors d'une très belle semaine mais la température n'a pas posé de problème. Le soir même l'été les nuits sont fraiches à San Francisco et l'appartement se rafraichit vite. 
Dans une des pièces se trouve un grand lit et un petit lit dans la partie pentue de la chambre. L'espace autour du  petit lit est restreint et très adapté à des enfants jusqu'à 12 ans environ car cela fait un peu cabane mais peut accueillir des personnes plus grandes si pas claustrophobes. Dans l'autre pièce se trouve un canapé qui sert de lit et qui dispose d'un second matelas qui se tire pour faire un couchage supplémentaire. On peut donc dormir jusqu'à 5 personnes. Dans cette pièce se trouve également un coin cuisine avec cuisinière four  micro-ondes cafetière... On peut faire un peu de cuisine rapide ou faire réchauffer un plat. Nous avons mangé dans le salon extérieur sur la terrasse car il faisait très beau. Il y a aussi un coin salon à l'intérieur mais il n'y a pas  de table pour s'asseoir et manger.
L'appartement se trouve près du Golden Gate Park dans un beau quartier. Cela est très agréable le soir et très calme par rapport au centre de San Francisco qui a une vie nocturne qui peut être agitée. On peut aller courir dans le Parc dans une très belle végétation et nous y avons visité 2 musées. 
L'accès à tous les points d'intérêt depuis l'appartement se fait très facilement en transport en commun. Il y a un arrêt de métro à 5 minutes à pied et un arrêt de bus encore plus près. On accède à Union Square en 20 minutes.
Nous avions pris l'option de ne pas garder notre voiture de location. Nous sommes venus en voiture avec jusqu'à l'appartement pour déposer les bagages et des courses que nous avions fait pour notre séjour puis nous l'avons rendu et pris un CityPass pour nous déplacer et visiter. Nous n'avons pas regretté notre choix la voiture n'est pas nécessaire pour visiter San Francisco et l'appartement est bien placé pour accéder à tout rapidement.
Au final nous avons passé un très séjour et apprécié le confort l'environnement et le calme de l'appartement."
350391,364453852,2018-12-30,13450462,Amanda,Lovely hospitality gorgeous views fabulous location. Hosts went above and beyond to make us feel at home. We’d definitely stay again.

29062428,526954985,2019-09-09,6593119,Sheena,This suite was perfect for our short trip. It is extremely close to the Muni line that goes past Chase Center which is very convenient for events at the arena. The hosts were pleasant and responded quickly check in and out were smooth and easy. Thank you Nathan and Traci!
6898334,145904651,2017-04-20,120432125,Papar,"when I went there so many things were broken Four Windows Bath room Drainage issue Kitchen Broken Faucet (later on) Water on the Kitchen Floor and most important the place is too low that you have NO connection with outside it is absolutely feels like a Prison.  Also it was very Dirty that I brought a professional Cleaners to clean up the place.  The Sheets and Towels are from at least few years ago I bought New Sheets and New Towels.  I killed many Little Bugs on the Walls and on the (Website hidden by Airbnb) the time I reported to property manager but they didn't care.  all they care to make Fast Money from a place which is not worth it.  I suffered emotionally and physically.  I moved out Two days earlier to 2000 Broadway one block away from that place but it is like a 5 star Hotel Suite.  still $1600.00 less than that place.
I have a fantastic View and I am on the 7th Floor.   Good luck with your trip to beautiful SF.     "

Phil was really helpful when we nearly missed the plane he found the solution for us to get at the airport on time.

8187584,473525820,2019-06-21,5377646,Brian,Edward was a gracious host.  He greeted us in a timely manner and was so kind.  He told us his recommendations for the city told us great restaurants and explained the easiest ways to get to where we needed to go.  He had fresh ground coffee ready for us each morning and had bottled water and even beer in the fridge for us.  I recommend this place for anyone who wants a location close to most iconic places in San Fran and who wants a host who is helpful yet gives you your privacy and space.  Would def stay again.
770991,48293978,2015-09-25,5235716,Murielle,"One my best experiences ever on Airbnb. 
Rose is such a lovely person. The place is refined furnished with style and elegance. You would not like to be staying in a different place Noe Valley has the absolute quietness of a village within the city.
Thank you Rose. "
561602,22800622,2014-11-15,22737663,Jon,"This is a wonderful place to stay and Matthew is the perfect host. The bedroom and living room have fantastic views across the city. It's spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished. You have sole access to a two-room suite at the top of the house - it's a great place to relax.

The house is on a peaceful street a couple of blocks away from the bustle and energy of the Mission district. There are lots of great affordable places to eat and drink nearby. It's conveniently located for Bart and Muni public transportation which will get you into the city centre within about 15-20 minutes.

Perhaps the best reason to stay here is Matthew himself. I couldn't have asked for a kinder or more gracious landlord. When I arrived he picked me up from the Bart station and took me for a drive. He was full of advice about where to go and what to do tailored to suit me. Matthew knows the city inside out and is full of great tips. He took his cue from me about whether I'd appreciate his company or prefer to be left in peace. Alone in an unfamiliar city I appreciated having someone to chat with over coffee in the morning or over a beer when I arrived home in the evening.

Matthew's basic decency came to the fore when on a cycling trip north of the city I fell off my bike and broke my elbow. Matthew dropped everything to collect me from an emergency room over an hour's drive from his home. When we got back he went out of his way to help me with all the simple tasks that were now cumbersome. It wasn't the ideal end to my holiday but incapacitated and a long way from home I was touched by his thoughtfulness and consideration.

This will be my first-choice place to stay next time I return to San Francisco. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
10835637,247501633,2018-03-28,164521,Taylor,Trey's place is situated in a fantastic neighborhood that is nearby to many wonderful restaurants shops and transit options and it is central to so many sight seeing options in the City. I was traveling with my 10 year-old niece and found the space with the bed and pull-out couch perfectly accommodating to our needs. I would highly recommend Trey's place to anyone visiting the city for fun or for work. Trey is very communicative and quick to reply to any questions or concerns you may have.

10943827,424000695,2019-03-15,25362772,Vincent,"We really loved our stay at Michaele's and Andy's place. It's located in a nice neighbourhood with some nice restaurants a foodmarket and public transportation nearby. 
We would definitely recommend staying at this cosy appartment!"
31439076,477166120,2019-06-27,33108358,Jean,"Kathy's studio exactly matches her description. It is very clean and full of amenities which made our stay enjoyable. The instructions on arrival Kathy gave us were very clear and reassuring. The location of the studio allowed us to have very easy access to all the public transportation that is very efficient in San Francisco. The metro line L was only 10 minutes walk. In addition there are several bus lines near the studio which were only a 5 minute walk away. It's really not necessary to have a car to get anywhere in the city from Kathy's accommodation.

We enjoyed our stay and it is obvious that if we return to this beautiful city our first choice will be Kathy 's apartment.

Thanks to Kathy for all the attention that made our stay enjoyable !!!"

6245649,87269505,2016-07-19,135202,Cynthia,The photos are very accurate.  Blake and Sara's place is airy and charming.  The decor has a beach theme but they keep it fresh and modern.  Beds were comfy and we had everything we needed.  I loved the location as it was great for morning jogs in the park or on the beach  quieter than most of SF yet we could take the N streetcar downtown to MOMA or connect to BART and go to the East Bay.  One night we made it from Richmond to our door in under ninety minutes!   We parked our car on the street and seldom used or needed it.  (be aware though that you can get a street cleaning ticket if you're not paying attention to the signs--I did :(  )  As a native SF-er I knew the beach would be cool and foggy in summer and it was--so pack a sweater and not the bikini.  We loved all the foggy mornings and sitting in the cozy breakfast nook drinking lattes from nearby Andytown Coffee.  Really a great trip! Thanks Blake and Sara for sharing your sweet home!
217106,241124999,2018-03-07,5960556,Dan,"Overall I had a good stay at Eric's place although there were a few hiccups. I found out when checking in that the previous guest had clogged the tub which resulted in a leak and pipes having to be replaced. So the tub/shower was out of commission for the first day of my stay. But to Eric's credit he was able to quickly make the repairs by the next day and offered a refund. Not ideal but probably the best that could be done in that situation.

I'd also mention that the photos are a bit misleading. The bed and couch are different and not as nice. A lot of the decor--house plants pillows wall hangings--have just vanished. It probably won't affect your stay in any real way but everything looks a lot more stripped down."
18873809,409399562,2019-02-07,25668145,Tim,Ryan and Meghan was super responsive helpful and friendly.  The area was quiet and it felt really safe.   The place was clean and cozy - it had everything that we needed for our baby and kid.
6336315,176412005,2017-07-30,71638980,Paul,Great apartment and location.  So much nicer than staying in a hotel near union square. Parking spot was extremely useful too. Will definitely try and stay here again.
2166428,74419037,2016-05-15,21105123,Amanda,Great location cozy and clean apartment and located near to the historic Haight St. area with lots of shops restaurants and food market. Tisa is  very nice  and answered us promptly.
491874,27685836,2015-03-09,28005180,Kandace,"My stay with Sona and Manuel was more than I could have asked for when looking for a place to stay.  Sona reached out to me prior to my stay with helpful information and they were so welcoming.

There home is great for one or two guests with a nice size room separate closet and large bathroom that has been newly remodeled.  I also enjoyed spending time in the back sun room and garden.

Their home was in a great location close to stores bars restaurants breakfast spots etc...  Easy for UBER pickup too.

I can't wait to come back and stay with Sona and Manuel again."

878935,200257217,2017-10-04,4512741,Sergio,Foi um prazer ter me hospedado com a Ashley sua comunicação sempre foi rápida e sempre esteve disponível. Utilizo muito o airbnb e a comunicação com a Ashley me chamou atenção positivamente.  Á casa fica num bairro calmo com vários restaurantes e bares.  Ficando a cerca de 20 minutos de carro dos Pier 33 e 39 Fisherman e Ghirardelli. A casa possui cômodos espaçosos e cozinha muito bem equipada.
5547500,357814901,2018-12-11,18299686,Anna,Great space with lovely humans to boot. No complaints. Would definitely re-book.
8474183,139298190,2017-03-24,105478552,Catherine,"The private patio with the high-end BBQ and red cafe seating set up was a bonus! We didn't BBQ this time because of the rain but just loved being able to open the sliding glass door in the kitchen and the security door in the bedroom and listened to the rain tap tap tapping away on the metal cafe seats. Love that sound! and the fresh air made me feel like I was at a retreat.

My husband and I took the bedroom which is comfortably designed and we had invited a guest who slept on the sofa in the living room. Since the nice sized bathroom is situated between the two rooms we all had plenty of privacy. Just a suggestion: Since there is a small 3 inch step down right before the door to the bathroom it would be nice to have a small handrail right at that spot to remind guests during the night to step down/up as they return to the sofa couch.

If in San Francisco again I would love to stay at Jonathan's apartment unit. It is only about a 20 minute drive to Ocean Beach with plenty of free parking The Cliff House Restaurant and Golden Gate Park. We enjoyed the day so much and when it was time to go home the commute was short and sweet.

Also it is in close proximity to freeways needed to take you in every direction you may want to go. Loved the ease of traveling to and from the unit to the sites we wanted to see."

Everything was designed very cool and nice. 
Parking is a little hard to find. 
The hosts are very friendly and helpful. 
We can not recommend this place enough"
1699390,18049929,2014-08-21,12450282,Anne,Exactly as described which is a good thing! Beautiful house very clean. The hosts were both very friendly. I had two jam packed days in San Fran  and the house was definitely quiet for me to get adequate rest at night. They instructions about check in and check out were extremely clear.

Something to consider: it is a steep climb up the stairs if you have large luggage or any sort of impairment. I also mentioned some nice to have amenities which Jacqueline said they are working on. All in all I would love to stay here again."
14505006,213104279,2017-11-19,156329877,Diane,Susann is a wonderful and helpful hostess.   The view from the terrace and surrounding area is stunning.   Although this was my first time using airbnb the space was larger than I anticipated.
8053887,77061200,2016-05-30,39520030,Alan,"Louise made us very welcome when we arrived and responded quickly when contacted during our visit. 

The neighbourhood was great close to Twin Peaks and a walkable distance from Golden Gate Park. A grocery store was close by as were transport connections to the downtown area. 

The garden was very private and a nice place to have breakfast. 

All in all a great base for viewing and getting around the city."
18874472,337574958,2018-10-16,21879047,Thomas,Kathy’s place was great for a short stay in SF.  The place was clean and Kathy was an attentive and welcoming host. She even stayed up past midnight to check me in. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend her place for your stay in SF.
9416254,405856765,2019-01-27,54275212,Ramon,Great location!  Very nice apartment!  Really enjoyed my stay here!  Glenn was very responsive and made everything really easy!  Thanks guys!

The location is also perfect -- right in the middle of the city and easy to get to wherever you want to go around town. 

I'd certainly come back and stay again the next time I'm visiting San Francisco!"
12857222,279484784,2018-06-20,6306881,Badri,Can't get a better value for money: ideal location clean friendly and good place to stay
6505426,282226567,2018-06-26,752202,Mauricio,Jeff's place is just amazing it's located within walking distance of restaurants bars and the Muni metro stations that will take you downtown in no time. The apartment was super clean and it had lots of commodities everything my group needed to have an outstanding experience in SF. The best part was Jeff's hospitality he was super responsive and kept on checking on us asking if we needed anything. I strongly recommend staying at his place.
5222044,334955190,2018-10-10,770883,Karen,This listing doesn't really do the house justice. From the outside the house is a bit of an ugly duckling compared to its neighbors but inside Jim and Suzanne have created a comfortable stylish and well equipped space that is perfect for travellers and an outlook onto a garden oasis. The location is great with a choice of public transport that enabled us to get anywhere we wanted with a minimum of fuss. They were thoughtful and considerate hosts and we so enjoyed chatting to Suzanne. We would most certainly return.
1317908,442544978,2019-04-23,228267668,Elizabeth,I highly recommend Susan!!! Her place is great and she is the kindest!
191632,17059634,2014-08-06,11377369,Colin,We had a great stay at Maria's and found it to be an excellent location for exploring the city. We definitely recommend checking out NOMA as they serve great food til 1 AM every night!  Thanks Maria!
6423158,63479642,2016-02-23,43346161,Romit,This was my second stay at Alice's place. As usual it was very comforting .. just like last time.. 
28895194,364528860,2018-12-30,46743191,Kiana,Nice space. 2 twin beds available for guest use and one bed that’s off-limits for guest use. A small kitchen area and also two pretty large working desks. Also a very nice view from the 12th floor! Aaron is also very quick to respond to messages and very helpful!
10369097,59858020,2016-01-16,51194563,Georgia,I would absolutely recommend this house and the host to anyone wanting to visit San Francisco. Collecting the keys from Keri was easy she was very flexible with meeting times which we really appreciated. Keri and her husband gave us a very thorough tour of the house and made us feel very welcome. They went above and beyond to supply us with whatever we could need from complimentary toothpaste to local restaurant recommendations! It was so fantastic to stay in such a well restored Victorian home. The house was immaculate and beautiful. It was great to stay so close to Golden Gate park with easy access to Fishermans Wharf and Union Square.

4439461,548080758,2019-10-16,246329691,Brittany,Awesome stylish place with convenient reasonably priced parking. The host Jeff is great and down to earth. Staying here was a treat and I would certainly stay again.
11620002,296854508,2018-07-26,22919433,Sean,Thuy's place was lovely such a great value! It's only a 20 minute walk from the BART station which is super convenient. It is in a nice quiet neighborhood. Thuy herself is very nice and has lots of information about the place and the city available for guests. I would definitely stay there again if/when I return to San Francisco.
5242394,237350478,2018-02-22,14297968,Marta,This was a great spot for a work trip - Frances and Dave made everything very easy.  The space was cozy and as described.  Very clean and comfortable. I highly recommend it!
2391772,37239313,2015-07-05,36789929,Anne,Michael was responsive and made sure everything was all set for our arrival. He quickly answered the questions we had. The apartment has an unusual layout but was clean and comfortable.  It was quiet.  The only caution I would raise is that the queen mattress has the dip in the middle that can make comfortable sleeping with two in the bed hard.
7931074,205264215,2017-10-21,62323196,Kelsey,Stephanie and Tom’s space was so perfect for our anniversary trip to SF. They were so easy to communicate with throughout the entire process and were incredibly accommodating with our travel plans. Stephanie provided lots of helpful tips for restaurants and ways to get around town and all her suggestions worked out well for us! The apartment is very stylish quiet and in a great location (we walked most places!). We definitely want to return and stay here again!
3133266,206730367,2017-10-26,15899598,Megan,This place is gorgeous! Totally immaculate and Tina & Jay were great hosts. Loved staying here and walking down to the Boulangerie every morning.
15849484,165423257,2017-07-01,51522857,Kirill (Kyrylo),I can't imagine a better host. The perfect host and home. Highly recommended!

14068781,420156178,2019-03-05,244991495,Kevin,"David was amazing. The location of his home was convenient and easy to find. He met us at his house answered our questions about the city and gave suggestions about places for us to eat that night. His home was amazing clean and had all the little touches thoughtfully and conveniently placed for us to use. 
Lastly was Bruce David’s dog who was friendly and loving. Would stay there in a heartbeat again if we were headed to San Francisco"
5045601,32971640,2015-05-24,4660571,Jacqlyn,"Overall this property was a great fit for me and my family. The location is absolutely perfect for what we were hoping to do and see in San Francisco and the apartment had all of the amenities that we needed. It was clean and very homey.

I would note that the ""bedroom"" is not quite as private as the word bedroom implies - the wall behind the bed is only a partial wall and at one point only separated from the kitchen by wooden blinds (you can see this in the photo of the bedroom). This made it very difficult for anyone to be awake before anyone else due to the noise traveling easily from room to room and with four guests that was a challenge.

Also due to an early flight we had hoped to check in early. I understand if this is not a possibility but it took four different communication attempts to get a confirmation from Amy that this was not possible for us to do. Although this was not a large inconvenience it was troubling that I was unable to get a response from the host through the airbnb website and only heard from her after multiple texts to her listed phone number.

Would like to reiterate it was a great location and great property and I would definitely recommend staying here.

14944663,307131006,2018-08-13,109543783,Dana,"What a lovely home in a great neighborhood.  Clean and well kept.  Carolyn was excellent in communication and was extremely helpful.  Perfect location walking distance to shops restaurants and more.  Wonderfully comfortable and cozy.  The back yard and deck were really nice with views up the hill to Sutro Tower.  Onsite parking was a nice bonus.  The garage is tight to get in but we were able to slip a full sized Ford pick up in by using extreme care and a few spotters.  Would not recommend that as a daily exercise but was perfect for our "" leave it and Uber"" weekend.  Uber & Lyft were everywhere and we never waited more that 5 minutes for a ride so there really is no need for a vehicle if you are traveling to the City via air.   "
14197078,263342281,2018-05-11,14486099,Linnea,This was my second stay here for a short work trip and everything was just as wonderful as the first time! Excellent option for a lovely reasonable room within easy distance of Mission Bay and Union Square.

6529234,506582130,2019-08-10,266374142,Lauren,This place is great! If you 're looking for a quieter location to stay but still close to the city this is the perfect spot. Street parking was never an issue we found parking reasonably close to the location even after returning late one night. Lyfts usually cost between $6-15 depending on the time / location travelling to in SF. The space is very clean and Adrian is very quick to respond to all messages!
21966629,508403869,2019-08-12,251802973,Sasha,Was perfect for me and my two friends.
23698833,258844997,2018-04-29,39963029,Anne,Alina’s apartment was a great location. It was my first time visiting San Francisco with a few friends and it was great having somewhere to come back to that was clean relaxing and welcoming. I definitely recommend staying in Alina’s apartment!
3319447,296867662,2018-07-26,65077692,Abbey,Anna’s Place was beyond perfect! Our visit took us into downtown and the N picks up 1 block from Anna’s place and dropped us off 1 block from our destination. We never had to worry about transportation! The apartment is very cute - the perfect size for 2 people. 
16710475,563432618,2019-11-12,16007488,Suzanne,Lovely quiet and private room. Host is terrific.

La ubicación es muy buena el desayuno estuvo bien para mi excelente que los lunes miércoles y viernes hay cena gratis.

Recomendado yo volvería."

10035487,77113674,2016-05-30,58704732,Derek,"The apartment was ideal for our stay. We were 4 adults staying for 2 nights and were very comfortable. The apartment was very clean with modern fittings and appliances and is accurately depicted in the listing.
This is a great vibey neighbourhood with shops restaurants and easy access to public transport. 
Raghni was a really good host easy to communicate with and very accommodating. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly visit again.   "
2518781,103853168,2016-09-24,24602377,Travis,We were extremely pleased with our accommodation and would certainly recommend it to others and if we return to SF soon we would be happy to stay here again! Scott is a great host that goes above and beyond for his visitors. The location of the suite is quite close to the Mission district and the 24th Street Mission BART Station (10 minute walk) and is a moment away from many other amenities. The apartment had everything we could ask for! Based on the prices of other accommodations in the area Scott's suite can not be beat. If you are San Francisco for a few days and are looking to stay in the Mission/Bernal Heights area you would be wise to stay here. 10/10.
2160504,23375083,2014-11-30,19872961,Ming,My very first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful. Will gave me very clear parking and check-in instructions and was always available for help. The house itself has a convenient location and very clean.

1017799,472938052,2019-06-20,35144207,Sean,Kameh‘s place was exactly what I needed for a short busy stay in the area. Check-in was a breeze and the room was clean and looked just like the images. The location is perfect for Inner Sunset or UCSF both of which are 1-5 minutes from the front door! Also in that range is the N Judah muni line which can take you all the way to downtown or you can stop at famous Dolores Park along the way. The space itself is bright and airy and very sweet. My favorite thing was the bed which was extremely comfortable. I was out and about all day and this was a nice quiet place to come back to and get some good sleep before getting back out there in the morning! Thanks Kameh!
23583822,277604202,2018-06-16,94175334,Kyile,"The place was very clean and tidy. Check-in was quick and easy as all you need is a passcode to open the main door and the room door. Everything in the house was great! 

Things to note: this house is not very near to main tourist attractions in the city. it may be better to rent a car but parking can be a hassle. you can get a MUNI pass but this does not cover BART (the train system) and the bus makes two switches and 40+ stops to arrive. the plus point is that the bus stop is less than 5 minutes away."
1827177,523479458,2019-09-03,110216667,Ashley,Ashish is awesome and gave us many helpful suggestions. His home is in a great location just a short walk to shops restaurants etc. Definitely recommend!

4250927,310562768,2018-08-19,71057126,Øystein,We were five Norwegians who had an excellent stay in Noe Valley! The apartment is clean and modern with everything you need. It looks even better than the pictures and Andy and Tanya tended to our every need. The location is great right next to the lively 24th St. 
14705126,262063142,2018-05-07,168299145,Valentin,Anna was a great host! Everything went well and the communication was super easy.

I totally can recommend this place and it was absolutely worth it!!

4022990,22005490,2014-10-27,22885773,Huy,Pacific Heights Inn was a reasonably inexpensive place to stay on short notice. I only stayed there for a night.  There is free parking for your car the typical amenities you would expect the rooms were clean and relatively quiet.  Its in SF proper and not too far away from the cooler more interesting neighborhoods. Not really a place to impress your friends but perfectly fine for small groups staying overnight in the city.
1206233,483741971,2019-07-07,188611169,Shruti,"Great location...nice and clean rooms. Although there is only one bathroom for all the guests but luckily we got up at 6AM . Everything was near from this place Uber was almost 5 or max 10USD to airport
It has few cons too being so expensive could provide better amenities.. matteres was of very poor quality I had Back pains.. And also could provide thick blankets or heaters as SFO is always windy and cold"

27765343,486494196,2019-07-12,15671652,Mike & Carissa,Emily’s place was great. Wonderful location nice space easy to access good value. Would stay again.
27852325,458203497,2019-05-25,68011011,Mary Grace,Great location amazing host comfortable space. Land's End is such an underrated place. Sylvia is absolutely wonderful. There is nothing more I could ask for. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
4617719,62892991,2016-02-18,50801193,Adeleh,The house was great and exactly as described. The fridge was stocked with the basics which was a really big help. The bathroom area made me feel like we were staying at a 5 star hotel.
27461006,346772631,2018-11-09,195699094,Haowen,Nice space close to many great amenities including Whole Foods. Nice kitchen with a roomy fridge. It's quite far back from the street so it's relatively quiet (assuming nothing else is going on in the building - I was unlucky and stayed when there was construction happening which wasn't pleasant but is probably rare enough to ignore). I stayed there late in the year so I had the heaters going slightly it was quite comfortable.
32192300,526285117,2019-09-08,51457089,Jay,Common area with all the breakfast & snacks was a welcome.  Ole ty of local restaurants w/in quick trip.  Parking was hard to find after 10pm unless you walk 2 or more blocks.
21623314,564033315,2019-11-14,84669815,Jack,"The place was great and exactly as shown in the pictures. The complex has a decently equipped gym and an outdoor swimming pool. The location is great for events at the Moscone center and it's only a 15 minute walk from the heart of the finance district and another 5 minutes to the water.

Eric was always very responsive."
4093967,355352427,2018-12-03,9553669,Paola,"Skate and Jeannie are easily one of the best hosts I've ever had through Airbnb.
They are genuinely lovely and their house is a piece of art of its own. 
We spent 2 weeks with them and we fell in love with our morning routine making coffee in their back patio and enjoying breakfast with the best view over San Francisco. 
The house is very well located just next to Bernal Heights Park and very close to Mission by walking hence very convenient. 
Once again everything about our stay was just lovely!"
4402199,169788967,2017-07-13,2032498,Sean,Love Springer's place. Excellent location nicely decorated amazingly comfortable bed with first class linens. Easy check in and check out great communication and best value in SF. Can't wait to come back.
2356554,300700208,2018-08-02,5670072,Gaelle,"We loved the place ! There were everything we needed and more ! We felt like home the neighbourhood is amazing and people are so friendly we felt like locals having our breakfast in a little cafe bumping into the same people in just 3 days we felt like moving there 
Tatiana has been very helpful and there were all we (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication beforehand and during our stay was perfect and we even got the chance to meet Tatiana and her partner before we left short meeting with lovely people :)
Tatiana has been very arrangeant and she had lots of little touches that we appreciated very much :)
I will definitely come back there when we will come back to SF :)"
8763529,348890819,2018-11-15,68417098,Steffi,For a small hostel it was great but a little crowded. But for this price a very nice place to stay in SF.
774323,294154032,2018-07-21,123753567,Evan,Jan and Thriller were great hosts while I was on business in SF. The room was very comfortable and spacious. The location was fantastic.
37978128,567504961,2019-11-22,2868063,Doug,Great location and very clean! Ruslan was really responsive and very helpful.
14490262,446101329,2019-04-30,239097757,Therese,If you have mobility problems this is not the place for you. The steps leading up to the front door is somewhat steep. There is also no hand rail for the first set of steps leading up to the bedrooms. The master bedroom has a lovely bed but it is also approximately 3 feet off the ground with one small stool to step on to get in and out of the bed. The tub in the master bath is also very high off the ground. Other than that the place was lovely and well maintained. Obviously Mary takes great pride in her home even if there were a lot of rules and regulations.
6601749,516761755,2019-08-24,23976485,Ezequiel,The place stinks with a strong cat pee odor. It has serious cleanliness issues. We filed a complaint with AirBnb and because similar complaints had been raised before we were refunded 100% of our payment. Besides the entire flat I s in general poor condition and needs substantial revamping. For example the only drawer chest in the flat was broken so we had nowhere to put our clothes in. Avoid this place if you can.
1474209,49128516,2015-10-01,18814078,Danielle And John,Great place to stay! Great location! Was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to completely avoid the time share offers! 
2460904,14857151,2014-06-28,15593534,Mark,Rubeun thanks so much for my great stay in your apartment.  Great design loved the decor and panda motives.  Wifi and gadgetry excellent and location was perfect for city centre. Pool hot tub and gym just added etc and I was lucky to have time to get a Thai Massage in spa below listing!  Great Host!
9926871,70813936,2016-04-21,19222981,Martin,jaw dropping view and verrry thought out livingspace enjoyed every day there. especially the sunrise is the bomb!
24828324,510941146,2019-08-16,264116042,Jen,We enjoyed our stay highly recommended for families with small kids.
585225,14742405,2014-06-25,1583479,Laura,Gabe was a fantastic host and incredibly accommodating - we had an early flight into SF and he was kind enough to let us store our luggage while we explored the city. The studio is cosy and clean with everything you could possibly need. Public transportation is a close walk away however we were happy to walk around the beautiful Noe Valley as well as walking around the Mission area which isn't too far away either. I would highly recommend a stay at this great studio. 
269463,1981644,2012-08-14,2586443,Greg,Very impressed with our stay here.  The place was clean with very nice amenities and is next door to GG Park and Haight/Ashbury area.  We didn't meet Lawrence but his friend helped us get situated and she was nice and quite helpful.  The interior decor in the house is really what makes the place unique and impressive - artwork lines the hallways interesting books are collected throughout the house and there is an immense music collection complimented by a huge sound system that would make any audiophile drool.  What's more the house is full of big game animal trophies (bear skin rugs and a stuffed gray wolf to name a couple) along with framed pictures of Lawrence from his hunts.  It was a surreal experience staying here - definitely recommend it.
3718865,88216466,2016-07-23,75100813,Geneviève,L'hôte nous a accueilli les bras ouverts en nous communiquant tous les détails pour accéder à sa maison quelques jours à l'avance. Superbe endroit où rester très intime et confortable. Belle salle de bain très propre! Il y avait shampoing café et tout ce dont on avait besoin. Elle nous a même fourni de la vaisselle supplémentaire. C'était un peu loin du centre-ville (30 min d'autobus) mais pour tout le reste je recommande sans hésiter. Merci Katie!
2315086,332196605,2018-10-04,49492056,Emese,Our party of three had a wonderful stay at Ron's. He's an outstanding host always available to offer help or local tips but also respecting his guests' privacy. The location was very convenient we had easy access to everything we wanted to visit. We could park our car in Ron's garage which was appreciated as we didn't need to use it during our stay. The neighborhood is safe and something worth seeing in itself. Would be happy to visit again - absolutely recommended.
27491792,558242853,2019-11-02,295293970,Christopher,Great place... enjoyed my stay
30264479,544253729,2019-10-09,27224066,Laurie,Great location - close to Hayes Valley neighborhood - good restaurants  civic buildings - love to explore the area.
1556680,20235777,2014-09-26,17755445,Frank,We (2 adults and 2 small kids) had a great time in this apartment. Very nice place to stay for us and the kids and we found the location near the park and still not too far from the city very convenient.David and Samantha were very helpful and responsive when we had any questions. Next time in SF we would like to come back!  
21123508,278800400,2018-06-18,194984560,Joshlyn,Het is een heel mooi appartement heel net en uitstekend gelegen. Weinig tot geen nacht lawaai. Een aangenaam verblijf.
1510363,23676635,2014-12-08,20064553,"Tim, Danielle En Aiko",We had a wonderful time staying at Tedd and Charlesie's place. The apartment fits the description exactly and Tedd and Charlesie thought of everything making you feel right at home. Freshly baked bread chocolate and some goodies in the fridge were awaiting us upon arrival and we even got an early morning treat when we left! You can ask them for advice on where to eat or what to visit and they will provide lists based on their own experiences and their friends'. The apartment is located in a nice neighborhood with a supermarket close by not far from a BART station. However parking our car hasn't been a problem either (keeping in mind that is was December though). To sum it all up: we wouldn't stay anywhere else in San Francisco!
238204,4818517,2013-05-27,6389474,Imad,"Jennifer and Mr. Lee were very accommodating and the apartment was as advertised. We rented a car and didn't use public transportation and the apartment is conveniently located within a 20-25 minute drive to anywhere in San Francisco especially the airport. Street parking is available. 

The reason why we did not give the apartment 5 stars is that the WIFI reception is poor in the apartment and we could not control the heating/air conditioning from within the apartment. Apart from that the apartment is clean and spacious the kitchen is well-equipped (with complimentary coffee tea hot chocolate!) the bathroom is well-equipped and the neighborhood is quite and peaceful. We would stay here again."
23150717,276430783,2018-06-13,22735600,Ian,"what a great host; possibly the best yet!
"
1696383,16771848,2014-08-02,4946677,Paul,My one month stay in SF was incredible thanks in large part to my accommodation choice. The place was clean and tidy upon arrival and the neighbourhood is a lot of fun with plenty of tasty food options just a short stroll away. The location is very central being only 10 minutes away from all the popular locations. Judy was an exceptional host. She was always very attentive and ensured I had everything I needed well before my stay upon arrival and during my time in SF. I have no hesitations recommending Judy and this place to other travellers visiting SF.
7663003,94186293,2016-08-15,71291289,Nate,Great room in a perfect location very close to AT&T Park and highway clean and comfortable and quiet at night. Great recommendation of Brickhouse too! Great brunch/bloody Mary spot.
6120540,35315601,2015-06-17,54332,Christine,Philip's room was perfect: large and spacious clean and very quiet. Located about 20 min walk (along Lake Merced very nice!) from the SFSU campus it was perfect for my needs. Philip is a very friendly host and was very flexible with my arrival and departure hours.
2802418,152828275,2017-05-18,60597982,Benoit,L'appartement est très joli et propre  dans un quartier résidentielle très proche de l'océan bus juste en face pour aller en ville  Gina très gentille et de bon conseils. je recommande 
7348398,497823794,2019-07-28,16000193,Richard,This is an amazing spot overlooking  San Francisco. Cosy and private rooms and incredibly open and kind hosts when you have invaded their space!
351881,19006854,2014-09-04,5296915,Petros,Second time at their house and everything was just great. We wouldn't look for another place in San Francisco :)
3793678,415441105,2019-02-22,960351,Mary-Elizabeth,"Private access smooth check in- clean and friendly!
Would def recommend!"
648086,150852436,2017-05-09,116797050,Carmen,Ponge was very hospitable we loved our stay with him. We felt very safe in the area and could easily walk to several restaurants. We used Uber to get to the tourist places which is pretty cheap if you pool. We would most definitely stay here again :)
27427727,426047736,2019-03-19,15873235,Pascale,vey nice roof top easy check in.  Warm welcome
10035487,138008049,2017-03-18,2873587,Valerie,Simple and clean with easy directions to access the apartment.  Close to UCSF.  Thank you for having me.
21334,646209,2011-10-19,675633,Ana,Joe is the ultimate host!  He stocked the fridge provided a lunch for when I checked in and gave me a ride to the airport on my return home.  Definitely a great experience.
29757684,547664131,2019-10-15,220557938,Bill,very clean fun neighborhood with a good breakfast spot and a great pizza. our rooms would have done well with a real shower instead of the old bathtub conversion which is cumbersome and some slippery. quiet and easily connected to the rest of the city.
2160504,238962577,2018-02-27,57259978,Duncan,Fantastic place to stay in. Room was big with an office space. Both Will and his Brother Carlos are such lovely hosts. Will allowed me to leave my luggages with him as I requested for an early check-in but the place wasn’t available prior to that. He even offered to move in my luggages for me to the room when it was ready. He was there to take me on a quick tour around his spacious house. During my stay Carlos answered me with my questions on where some amenities were and also how long do I need to get to the airport. Definitely recommended for travellers heading to sfo!
4897143,61926215,2016-02-09,739788,Jonghee,It was wonderful! Really fun and affordable place to stay. I would be happy to stay again. 
3376895,68233463,2016-04-03,51365728,Brian,"Blu was fantastic from the very beginning.  I needed a last minute place to stay and she was immediately responsive and accommodating to my request.  I have stayed in both of her rooms and they are both very well appointed and comfortable to be in.  And the living room...wow it is beautiful and alive with plants and artwork!

The J line is only a 2 minute walk away and there are 2 BART stations within easy walking distance as well so getting into town is a breeze.

Full cable TV great wi-fi great city views a charming garden laundry on site and a wonderful host...of course I'd recommend Blu's place!"
19236728,245825076,2018-03-23,4582730,Casey,Stayed at The Donatello multiple times via AirBnB always great. Has the amenities of a hotel with the price and convenience of AirBnB.

29417185,431311171,2019-03-31,153845713,Solomon,What a great experience I had staying here. I won't say much other than that it was a very enjoyable experience. You get a full view of the street your on because you have a corner room. Quite a large room for the price and location. If you don't mind no TV in your room then this is the place for you.
23613300,400334986,2019-01-11,171359790,Carolyn,Good apartment area is nice. There is no table to sit at which was usually fine as out and about.
3343629,31043573,2015-05-01,4696253,Marieke,Annette was really friendly and easy to connect with. The house is amazing it's big great location and a super garden. Everything is fully equipped and we felt @ home for three months in this house. I would recommended this place to everyone how is visiting San Francisco.
1421774,55034996,2015-11-27,33283475,David,Vanick and Deborah have a very charming and comfortable home I hope to stay at again very soon.  The location was perfect since it is centrally located walking distance to the Castro.  The patio area outside the unit is a great added bonus.  They are excellent hosts who were very accommodating and welcoming.  I was particularly sold on staying at their home since they made parking available to me.  Their home is the best value you'll find in the bay.
2783251,402541007,2019-01-18,216169713,Anna,"We had a wonderful stay in San Francisco. The apartment was centrally located for exploring and Ellen was a great host with really thoughtful touches.
The apartment was a perfect base offering a living area and seperate bedroom and not forgetting an outstanding view. 
We will never forget waking to the sound of sealions in the distance truly amazing. 
Thank you"
1673011,30343861,2015-04-20,3757327,Chelsea,"Drew and Nick's home overlooking Dolores Park is stunning. I was in town for a few nights with my brothers and this place made our stay unforgettable. The back porch is utterly fantastic with the hypnotic view of the city the bay and the trees dancing in the breeze. Everything you could ask for is provided (and more). (That view from the master bedroom?!? Cut it out.) Check in and check out was a breeze- we felt very safe and parking was easy on the street. Even sitting and relaxing on the front steps surrounded by flowers was enjoyable. Some amazing restaurants bars and shopping is within a few blocks but we spent an equal amount of time just reveling at ""home"". What a place! "
1925206,234944025,2018-02-14,166391399,Anna,房子距离市区开车10几分钟房东出租一楼面积不是特别大但设施还是比较齐全的.
7022309,303602443,2018-08-07,93694032,Rachel,Beth’s place was great for our short stay in San Francisco. The room was spacious light-filled and comfortable. 
17097361,345320805,2018-11-04,6335252,Kristiina,Simran's place is exactly like in the pictures and previous reviews; it's perfect for a short stay and/or business travel. Everything went super smoothly from check in to check out - Simran is a lovely host! The location and the area itself could not be better.
4670847,107679195,2016-10-11,55513694,Shi,"The location is good. Staffs also helpful.
They provide free vegetarian meals.
Let traveller have a communication with each other.
But the facility is a little bit poor."
1605483,434840765,2019-04-08,53639682,Brooke,I loved my stay here! I was in San Francisco for a course at UCSF Parnassus Campus and couldn't have asked for a better location. It was a quick 5 minute bus ride and the stop was just down the street from the Airbnb. I found this location to be very convenient for taking public transit throughout the city for sightseeing as well as the bus stop is a 2 minute walk away. Haight street is also 2 min away and has a lot of cool shops along it. Golden Gate Park is less than a 10 min walk away too! Overall this was a great location with a comfy bed and I would definitely stay here again.
18286171,536439884,2019-09-26,25740333,Rebecca,Ting Ting’s place is great with its own private entrance and easy check-in instructions. The room was a great size and very clean with all the amenities you could want. It had a great communal lounge/kitchen area although with other private guest rooms off of the hallway. It was great for a solo traveller such as myself :-)
4013746,59373343,2016-01-10,48509848,Olivia,We arrived at sue and chuck's later than expected and upon arrival Chuck gave us an excellent welcoming. They have a warm cozy place. Very close to everything that we needed to get to. Both were very friendly approachable and easy to communicate with. I highly recommend their place and Would surely stay here again if visiting San Francisco! 
496226,26644436,2015-02-16,24495105,Kevin,Awesome place. The flat was perfect and had plenty of room. It was a beautiful space and felt very homey. I really enjoyed using their kitchen to cook dinners for the nights we were there. Pam was also very helpful and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. The flat is also in a great location on Portrero Hill and was conveniently close to bars restaurants and cafes. Overall a great place to stay for a true San Francisco experience. I would definitely stay again.
14068781,204549143,2017-10-18,1115319,Daniel,One of my favorite locations to stay in san francisco. Comfortable and nicely furnished apartment. David was very nice and Bruce is a sweet dog
16406118,156500714,2017-05-30,7567834,Dawn,Chaz's rooms were very clean and nice. The kitchen looked to be state of the art. The bed and room appointments were very nice. 
70753,3455047,2013-02-01,4549918,Cristina,I really loved staying in this hostel. It was a lot of fun meeting with the other guests and there definitely was a sense of a community of travelers. My room was really clean and my bed was nice. My room was bright with four other girls with a total of 6 beds. I loved the location and being really accessible to Public Transportation. When I arrived I got a map and the receptionist showed me the areas on it that would be great to go. There were two computers to use and wifi and there is breakfast in the morning of bread and tea. The kitchen is clean as are the bathrooms. I had a really great time and would definitely recommend people staying here when they are coming to SF and would like to meet people right away.
14552166,404098135,2019-01-22,115969096,Megan,Great value clean & in the heart of SF. Nice brewery/restaurant attached to it as well. Would stay again.
14763705,223787174,2018-01-01,86788945,Jonathan,Good value for a great home.
1998111,501548139,2019-08-03,110059305,Maitê,Kenix and Kevin’s house is very nice. They are amazing hosts. Even though it is a shared space and you do share the bathroom with other guests it was spotless clean and it felt very private. It was nice to get home after a long day to a clean bathroom. Also Kenix was always available to answer my questions and was always helpful. San Francisco is overall a city with limitations towards parking so have that in mind if you come by car. It might take you a few runs around the block just take a good look at the signs and you should be fine. I would stay here again and definitely recommend staying here.
4257302,101335469,2016-09-12,21108667,Andrew,We had a great stay at Alexandra's place. The suite is on the ground floor of a classically styled San Francisco house. The space was clean comfortable and cozy. It was good for a relaxing stay. Alexandra was great with communication and making sure we were comfortable.
21935870,341779198,2018-10-27,107623754,Aida & Chris,"What should we say? We felt in love at the place as soon as we took our first step inside the suit! It is big very modern very clean and very comfy! Olivia and Dan are super great hosts! They answer within a couple minutes but the leave you alone.. it is as if they even aren’t there.. except you need them.. 
The location is just perfect! It is very quite but you can go by foot to following places (we did): Lombard Str. fisherman’s wharf pier 39 the Coit 
The bathroom is luxurious and the shower ist exactly what you need after 9 hours of sightseeing :) 
I would recommend everybody this place!!! 
I hope we see you guys again and thank you for everything :)"
23568246,337593147,2018-10-16,9719636,Jillian,Brad’s place is in a wonderful location. Parking was super easy. Bed was very comfortable and the awesome soup selection in the shower was a nice touch!
12582732,536006160,2019-09-25,186296296,Colin,Barb was very welcoming and the room/bathroom were spotless. The building was relatively quiet too!
72444,542842130,2019-10-06,22567998,Heather,This was such a fun place to stay! It's a great place to meet other travelers and make new friends from around the world. Wonderful location (Website hidden by Airbnb) many restaurants and sights within a short walk and very close to multiple public transit stops.
21550910,368474007,2019-01-07,103686774,Yangyi,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
680288,423632274,2019-03-14,124613143,Jackson,Ken’s place was in such a prime location of SF. Listen to their recommendations as he knows SF and the Mission like the back of his hand.

Thank you."

22662336,301195166,2018-08-03,28756850,Hannah,this is a solid place to stay. it's a little dependant on who else is staying in the other rooms. if they're considerate it's great. if they're not it's rough (noisy messy etc). but individual rooms have private locks so over all it's not a bad place to stay. the kitchen was pretty amazing as was the back deck. I'd recommend this place to a friend. 
15822076,475767868,2019-06-24,83845339,Blake,This home is a great stay for someone looking for a convenient affordable and cozy place to stay. Eileen was a great host and I would not hesitate to recommend her place to anyone traveling to the Bay Area.
2104437,48245830,2015-09-24,42179990,Mia,Beautiful place - the stay was very pleasant. The apartment is lovely with amazing views. Close to everything touristy that I wanted to see and do. The room was large and the bathroom was very clean! The whole place was immaculate in fact! I really enjoyed my stay. I only met Jose briefly but he was very lovely and was quick to respond to any questions my msgs. 10/10 stay!

And Traci is an excellent host!!"
71645,75419725,2016-05-21,2261865,Jeff,I had a fantastic time at Jeff's place. Bernal Heights is gorgeous and the room faces out on a beautiful backyard garden. The room is completely separate from the rest of the house with its own bathroom so it feels more like your own space than a shared room. I'll definitely try to stay here next time I'm in sf.
209514,32057791,2015-05-13,28136398,Toni,Josh's place was the perfect location for us to explore San Fran . It had everything we needed and we felt comfortable coming and going as we pleased.

L'accès à la douche est facile et toujours disponible. Michelle est une hôte excellente. Elle est disponible au besoin et si vous voulez être tranquillement seulement qu'à fermer la porte  en  haut de l'escalier 

Facilement accessible par le BART à partir de l'aeroport et à 20 minutes du centre-ville (marche+BART).  Market et Taqueria formidables près de la station BART. "

794626,427475868,2019-03-23,150574007,Fabio,A great place in a good location close to everything. The place is big and comfortable. We were a family of 4 and felt we had enough room. Easy access to transit restaurants parks and shopping. Justin is a very good guy and responsive. They have small kids and they woke up around 7 am so we could hear them walk a little bit at that time (Justin had told me about this so no surprises). Overall very satisfied with the place. Highly recommended!
4957143,300261051,2018-08-01,87398275,Tara,Tom & Beth's place was great - it was easy to get in is centrally located in a nice safe neighborhood and was very clean and comfortable.

It was very convenient to public transportation and close to Golden Gate Park.  We found many good restaurants in the surrounding area. We would recommend Simon and Joan's airbnb to friends.
23681212,273910129,2018-06-07,45954111,Seth,I've stayed here a couple of times now for meetings downtown and will keep coming back. Big newly renovated luxurious rooms. You won't find a better deal in this price range.

She and her husband keep the space up-to-date by reinvesting into the apartment."

259621,24287540,2014-12-24,18138157,Hayyu,Perfect neighbourhood; walking distance to BART and metro 35 minutes away from airport by BART. Close to most tourist destinations I like to walk everywhere and this is perfect! The hostel staff cannot be more friendly helped with directions luggages information on tourist places and provided a map. Clean shower and bathroom. But get an extension cable if you stay the top bunk.
3792754,25562441,2015-01-19,23877105,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful stay at Angie's place.  First Angie was very responsive prior to our arrival.  She gave us recommendations for restaurants and things to do and she gave us advice about public transportation in the area.  She left a thoughtful welcome note for us along with some wine and yummy candy.  She also has a binder in the apartment with maps and information about SF which we found very helpful.  

The apartment is in a very nice residential part of SF.  I liked staying in a true SF neighborhood rather than a very touristy area.  There are many great restaurants a short distance away.  The apartment was spotlessly clean and exactly as depicted in the pictures.  The two bedrooms rooms were perfect for our family of four and the back (master) bedroom was extremely quiet.  Angie thoughtfully had the trundle bed made up for us she knew that we have two children.  There were plenty of towels and the kitchen was well-stocked with all cooking essentials.  The only negative about the place was that my car (which is a large SUV) didn't fit into the garage (well we made it in but almost didn't make it out).  We ended up parking along the curb (blocking the driveway to the garage) which was fine.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Angie's place again whenever we return to San Francisco."
19407065,231347426,2018-01-31,86514403,Mike,"Todd was a perfect host.  The room had everything we needed and more with many amenities.   We enjoyed all the space and especially the big deck outside the room with a great view!   The location was ideal and close to the places we wanted to visit either by walking or Uber.

We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone visiting San Francisco.

Irene and Mike"
15327674,200503837,2017-10-05,41316662,Lynne,Great location and a superb host. The accommodations were perfect to enjoy days sightseeing and evenings relaxing with a nice bottle of wine.
16497229,202079626,2017-10-09,125401430,Tracy,"Thank you Elisa for being on top of communication! It was my first Airbnb and Elisa made it a great first experience. I always imagined me having anxiety because it could be a fraudulent post haha but that's just me! 
The location was amazing - you're less than .5 mi from the Fisherman's Wharf walking distance to the Ghirardelli a few blocks from Lombard (but they're uphill blocks) and a convenient stroll outside to the cable car. 
The room was cozy - comfortable bed nice vintage artworks and furnitures. unfortunately there were no locks on the door but for a trip that was mostly spent outside the house it wasn't a big deal.
It's a one bathroom place so it's shared. So if you're comfortable with that then everything is all good! 

Pat's cafe next door was AMAZING as well for breakfast :)"
6272183,46151654,2015-09-08,39526642,Jack,We loved staying at this roomy studio while we were visiting our daughter who lives in the area.  The studio was comfortable quiet clean and exactly as described on the airbnb website.  I was very excited to find everything I needed to make coffee in the morning provided in the condo.  Although we did not cook there is a well stocked kitchen with modern appliances.  It is located in a quiet residential neighborhood but shopping restaurants and public transportation are a short waIk away.   I would definitely want to stay here again when we come back to visit our daughter.
2047469,13666878,2014-06-02,13979006,Eric,Kenix is very sweet. The place is not very far from what is happening in San Francisco. There were a few hiccups when we arrived check in was an hour late due to a prior  guest not checking out on time. The room was not as nice as I expected but good enough. And the bedding could have been a little nicer. I was a bit scratchy/itchy/cheap.... The room was very big!!! And the set up with a communal bathroom and kitchen was actually really nice! I would stay again mostly because the owner was so sweet and willing to accommodate all of our needs....  Perfect for someone passing through town looking for an inexpensive night of rest and a clean bathroom! 
5980039,32193812,2015-05-15,25862484,Cara,Very communicative and accommodating. Made the stay very pleasant. I even had to extend my stay and Saana was very helpful. Great stay.
5317789,34543526,2015-06-09,5365645,Aurelie,"Josiane was a perfect host her home was like ours. Such a tenderness It was really cosy and calm. The neighborhood is so pretty and secure. This is probably the best air bnb we enjoyed. 
The house is beautiful !! And the bed very confortable.
It is as sunny as Josiane is !!! "
785901,91255761,2016-08-04,31411417,Benjamin,"As it happened I actually checked out of this place in my first night. While I was told that I would be sharing with 5-7 others I didn't realise that it would be such an 'open dorm' situation (as I recall there were two or three other compartments of 6-bed dorms not separated by doors. I needed to catch up on a lot of sleep that week so the idea of spending three nights of most probably being woken up by one of at least 18 people was not appealing to me.

This is not to discredit the hostel at all. It is after all a hostel! It was just not what I was expecting or looking for so I found accommodation elsewhere.

From my one hour experience of this place the staff were very friendly and the place is well located for central SF activities."

17592480,140390594,2017-03-29,118703019,Stephen,"Albert and Tiffany were superb hosts! They did a great job of anticipating the needs of travelers from giving local suggestions of spots to visit to allowing guests use of their laundry machines. They are new to hosting but are well on their way to becoming super hosts. 

As a first time visitor to San Francisco I thought long and hard about where to stay that was affordable close to most attractions and close to the airport. If these three criteria are what you are in search of then look no further. 

The bed was comfortable amenities clean and overall experience as advertised. "
7345468,110361591,2016-10-25,12584844,Ed,Glen Park Oasis is definitely the right description for this amazing place.   It was brand new and felt more like a suite at a 5-star resort.  Every detail and amenity was thoughtfully planned.  We looked forward to coming back after a long day of sightseeing in the city.  Parking was convenient and the Bart was just a 2 minute walk away.  Will definitely be coming back in the future.
19659835,208291823,2017-10-31,117478489,Chris,Glen’s place is so quintessential SF.  Book it.  You’ll wish you owned it.
5547500,141587629,2017-04-03,72881077,Robert,This was my first real Airbnb stay. The city view from the balcony was beautiful. We enjoyed our two wonderful hosts who helped us pick the best places to go. Our bedroom and bathroom were comfy and perfect for relaxing. I will never forget the great cup of coffee and the homemade healthy cereal we woke up to! When we go back to San Francisco I hope  we can stay there again! 
1738415,407031015,2019-01-31,30352523,Max,The place was really clean great location and great value. Donna had some extra snacks in the fridge which was a lifesaver when I didn't feel like going out before dinner but wanted something. Would definitely stay again next time I am in San Fran.
1148625,219139144,2017-12-16,107722531,유리,"방이 깨끗하고 혼자 쓰기에는 충분히 넓고 좋아요. 샤워시설은 호스트와 나눠쓰지만 깨끗하고 좋고요. 동네도 안전한 축에 든다고 합니다.
호스트도 친절하고 개인 생활에 그다지 터치를 안해서 조용하고 평화로웠던 것 같습니다.
 관광지들과 그다지 멀지 않습니다. 다만 집이 조금 춥습니다. 히터가 방에 있긴 합니다. 겨울에 가실 분들 중 본인이 추위를 좀 탄다 싶으시면 참고하세요.

9067632,70829003,2016-04-21,3712327,Steve,Made a two night stay while on vacation in San Francisco. Amy was a great host and her place was awesome. Tough to beat a heated bathroom floor! She was very prompt in responding and provided clear direction on how to get to and access the home. Her house had pretty much all the amenities one could hope for and was very comfortable. I'd certainly recommend staying here and would certainly do so again for future visits. 
9196933,369226684,2019-01-09,197244170,Matt,Best Air BnB experience I’ve had. Jim and Deb were exceptional hosts providing us with every bit of pertinent info and more about their home the surrounding area and SF as a whole. Staying in their home felt like just that home. The location couldn’t have been better the host couldn’t have been more inviting and I will stay there again at every opportunity. 10/10
4909117,171074513,2017-07-16,138372588,Abbey,Such a great place to stay. It was on a very busy street but within walking distance to so many great places to eat and shop. We definitely enjoyed our stay.
19015884,456504219,2019-05-21,16780051,Rachel,We had a fantastic time in Bernal Heights the apartment is lovely and totally as described and really easy to get to nearby amenities like the BART good coffee and great restaurants are also just a very short Uber away. Jennifer was really great at communicating and very accommodating. Would definitely recommend to others.
22968438,287152234,2018-07-07,34463034,Katie,"We enjoyed our stay at Shaun's place very much! It was super clean had nice amenities (TV towels bathroom supplies coffee etc.) and check-in/out was easy and efficient. It's located in a quiet safe neighborhood within walking distance of some nice restaurants and a short drive to downtown and other nearby attractions. Even though there were other people staying in Shaun's place at the same time there was never a fight for the bathroom as there are two upstairs and one was always available.

We felt Shaun has offered visitors to SFO a great value and would absolutely stay there again! We also appreciate the fact that Shaun and his aunt allowed us to stash our luggage for a while after check-out as our flight didn't leave until late at night. Thank you Shaun!"
5013816,126812252,2017-01-14,1845286,Helen,Jeff was very friendly and helpful. The room was large and comfy. The only problem was that the walls are not very sound proof and if you get two chatty neighbors you can pretty much hear everything.
1738415,515973081,2019-08-23,56206870,Stephen,A great spot in a convenient location!
10494263,551966728,2019-10-20,13675567,Sasha,Amazing location beautifully designed space. Great communicator easy check in. You need to be ok with a dog and cat - so just something to be aware of.
11437331,243139124,2018-03-14,144132768,Michelle,Maria is an amazing host - she provided detailed check-in instructions as well as tips that first time travelers to SF would greatly appreciate. Her location was within perfect walking distance to my workplace. The home is warm and cozy exactly as described. And her pup is adorable!! Highly recommend Maria's place - looking forward to staying here again the next time I'm in town.

This studio condo was perfect for our needs.  The building felt secure because of the fob system.  The location was good as well.  When we return to San Francisco we will do everything we can to stay at this condo again.  It's great for a couple.  "

Great location nice place to stay ability to park off-street at no extra charge without having to hunt for parking was a really nice extra.

259621,241581486,2018-03-09,172273131,Montana,The people were great the location is next to so much and other guests were courteous in regards to respecting the quiet hours. For the solo traveler this is a must. I walked to the BART train the wharf city lights bookstore enjoyed food in Chinatown and checkout was easy as I had to leave 6am but was informed to just drop the key in a cubby hole. Recommend this place for anyone on the go and ready to rest when it’s time to rest in a nice environment.
664307,267751686,2018-05-22,51462871,Erika,Geoff’s space was great and in a convenient location! Geoff was very helpful with tons of tips and suggestions. We would stay again!

The romantic bells from the famous Cable Cars off in the distance?  A quiet street yet it has a wine bar and several highly rated restaurants within 2 blocks?  A host who seems less interested in profits than the pure joy of making his guests comfortable relaxed and pampered?

This is the place."
137546,8544594,2013-11-04,9543982,Farah,"Christopher was an excellent host to my friend and I during our stay at his place. We kind of screwed up our date of arrival in SF and it turned out that we booked Chris' place a day later. We only realised our mistake when we arrived at his place 11 at night. Chris was kind enough to let us stay despite not having booked our stay for that night. We were truly grateful for his kindness.

Our stay at his place has been eventful. Chris went out his way to make sure our stay not only of comfort but also an enjoyable one. We were shown a few interesting places nearby Bernal Heights and Mission district (the night view on top of bernal hill is phenomenal btw) and we got Chris to thank for that experience. He also encouraged us to stay another night for free just so we can experience 'Day of the Dead' held at Mission area. 

All in all the room was cozy and comfortable. The area is fantastic for travellers to explore. Chris was an awesome host. Highly recommended for a short AND lond stay."
7067087,39207198,2015-07-21,6315638,Tiffany,Great hostel in a central SF neighborhood with easy access to FiDi Nob Hill Embarcadero Center and SoMa. Enjoyed the common lounge areas and group dinners.

Location is prime. Walking distance from piers to do tours. Right above a pizza place. Center of bars and some gentlemens clubs if you are planning to enjoy some nightlife. We were forunite to have had a street view. Really got the local vibe.

Separate bathrooms for women and men. Allow the water to run for a minute and it warms right up.

Approved."
1104912,185515108,2017-08-21,62551890,Franck,We had such a great time in Chani's appartment. It's very close from the golden gate park and golden gate bridge. The area is quiet but it's easy to commute from there. Also the appartment was very clean and comfortable. I recommend!
545685,9666311,2014-01-04,10917338,Stephen,A very simple pleasant overnight stay.  A great deal overall.
8195144,51322634,2015-10-19,20991010,Dana,Elena was very helpful and friendly from the moment I booked my stay at her studio. Prior to our arrival she offered help with things to do in the area and information on how to get around the neighborhood. She also left menus of restaurants in the area in the studio for us. Elena messaged me the evening before our arrival because she wasn't going to be home when we arrived but gave us instruction on how to get in  and we did so with no trouble whatsoever! The studio is tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city noise in a cute little neighborhood. We did not have a car but used Uber (Uber Pool is the best)  most of the time and had no issues at all. Elena's studio itself was cute and adorable; it looks exactly as it appears in the photos. It was clean and had everything we needed. The only way in and out is through the garage door which was a little strange and loud but didn't cause us any issues. The studio is located underneath Elena's house and it is a little bit loud in the morning when they are getting ready. We typically slept through it but it did wake us a few times. Overall  Elena and her studio were lovely and hospitable. The area it is located in made us feel safe at all times of the day and was centrally located for exploring the city.
2026910,402235635,2019-01-17,230026112,Michel,Bree is a friendly host and her place is immaculately designed and decorated. If you're looking for a stylish-yet-comfortable spot to call home while visiting SF I would highly recommend Bree's place .
23150717,300277696,2018-08-01,199330970,Brent,Roberto communicated quickly and smoothly. He kept his place very clean and it was a comfortable place to rest and sleep after a day of sightseeing in San Francisco. In an expensive city to stay Roberto's place was a better choice than many hotels. There was added options of having coffee making breakfast and snacks before leaving for the day.

En cuanto a Brian un gran anfitrión. Muy amable y siempre pendiente de que uno se sienta cómodo y confortable. "
256148,1999110,2012-08-16,1663673,Stéphanie & Hélène,Our first experience on airbnb and it was really great. Situation apartment room bed cleanness amenities... all is perfect. Our only regret is that we didn't met Chris due to a family emergency. She is a great   communicator and answered quickly all our questions even if she was not here. We hope we will have chance to meet her one day. She has two lovely cats one very sweet and cuddle and the other one more distant but funny ! We highly recommend this place and this was a great experience. Thank you
18615032,321644108,2018-09-10,37838401,David,Rudy's airbnb was perfect for me and my girlfriend. Central location in San Francisco close to all the best districts.  The highlight of the location for us was having Corona Heights Park just a couple blocks away. Modern and clean airbnb we would quickly stay in again.
15005046,209196563,2017-11-04,13414821,Valentina,Irina and Gregory were great hosts. Their place is comfortable clean well looked after and ideal in our case since we had a car that we could freely park just in front of the house. It took us about 15/20 min to reach most central SF locations and the airport is also about 20 min away. The neighbourhood is really pretty. We would definitely recommend it and would love to stay there again in the future!
19364007,517778292,2019-08-25,178158784,Ali,Geoffrey's place was great! Everyone is really nice and I enjoyed chatting with Rich and Geoffrey when I was hanging out in the kitchen upstairs. About the room I stayed in it's on the first floor along with one other room and a bathroom. The main kitchen is upstairs but there is a kitchenette on the first floor.  I stayed in the summer and I never felt too hot or cold but could easily open the window if I wanted extra airflow. One note that future residents may want to know is that you can hear a lot through the ceiling (but interestingly not through the walls). This means that you can hear people walking in the kitchen and occasionally conversations/music. The vast majority of the time there is little movement upstairs so this never bothered me. On the plus side when Rich or Geoffrey are hosting a party they invite the Airbnb residents :) I was extremely happy with my stay and was sad to leave so I will definitely be staying again!
1598886,225887372,2018-01-07,71519252,Tanishq,The place was beautiful and clean location was great if you’re into good food and drinks and the host was really hospitable and helpful. Would highly recommend this place for your stay in SF!

+ Neat and spacious house beautifully furnished
+ Great mattresses especially after those back-breaking motel beds
+ Nice neighbourhood within walking distance of Valencia street (with all the bars and shops)

-Nothing really. Maybe a bit far from the centre but that's no problem thanks to UBER."

Everything in the air bnb is well thought out with instructions and recommendations that are easily accessible for guests. She was a great host and I would definitely return to this air bnb!

19332338,197754778,2017-09-26,135847198,Marietta,All in all this was a great place!  Loved being able to have the whole family together and each having their own bedroom.  The location was perfect!  Trader Joes CVS local coffee shops convenient market was about 200 feet away that we went to daily that was well stocked and the places for fabulous brunches were just 2 blocks away!!  Thank you!
8904047,251928243,2018-04-08,147929998,Judith,Lovely unit quiet street handy location in the Mission
17775284,507694783,2019-08-11,8354818,David,Great part of town — easy access to Whole Foods Safeway Duboce area Mission and straight down Market St to the city. Very basic living quarters but everything you need if you're not expecting luxury
992913,4630022,2013-05-16,6281199,Mark,Just a perfect location - close to loads of cool shops and hip bars but very quiet and secure. Basic accommodation but spotlessly clean and neat with fast Wi-Fi. Great communication from Greg and Irina.
32591418,489940727,2019-07-17,238586203,Jennifer,"We loved our stay here! It was last leg of our trip after a two week road trip up the coast with our four kids. We enjoyed having a house to call home for a few days! It was in a nice location... we could walk to restaurants the park and botanical gardens the neighborhood was safe and clean and quiet! You can see the towers of the bridge from the house on a clear day! 
The house was stocked with everything we needed and there was a nice market just a few blocks up that had your basic items! Kristen checked in with us several times to see if we were settling ok or if we needed anything which was so nice it was like staying in a friends home! 
We’d highly recommend this house to future travelers! We loved our stay and can’t say enough good things about it!!!"
8351923,269687036,2018-05-27,25605625,Amy,Michelle's place is adorable! We loved our very cozy home away from home! We were in town for our daughter's graduation and it was so nice to end each night in such a lovely place. The neighborhood is beautiful and very quiet. We took Uber everywhere and the location was convenient to everything we did. Each morning we enjoyed a cup of tea or coffee by the cute little electric fireplace (it's also a heater). One night we ordered pizza in and had our daughter and her boyfriend over to relax and have dinner after days and nights of festivities. The kitchen was fully stocked to enjoy our small get together. Then there's the bathroom...the rain shower and the heated toilet...heavenly! If arriving at night she has lights that come on as you walk up the path to the gate and front door. A small yet safe detail. We will choose Michelle's place next time we are in town and hopefully it will be available!  
5632452,334682624,2018-10-09,153639668,Roberto (Rob),Overall good stay. Location is not the greatest for central city activities be prepared to drive walk forever or use a Lyft. ✌
29611738,484917162,2019-07-09,37602310,Eloisa,Dani's place was simply perfect for our 3 day vacation in SFO. I traveled with my two teens and boyfriend and the space was appropriate house is very conveniently located and the neighborhood cute and with wonderful restaurants within walking distance. While we mostly stayed there during the night the place had all the amenities needed; in the kitchen for breakfast (really appreciated the coffee :) well stocked items in the bathrooms and very nice sheets and pillows for a perfect night sleep. Dani was very attentive and available and will highly recommend her place to my friends and family.
4902063,30958954,2015-04-29,22680307,Alessandro,Very clean room and nice host. Good sport for a couple of days. Average wifi
3759368,417894081,2019-02-28,37605875,Jake,Perfect location and the heated floors were really a wonderful addition. Leo was very responsive and made our stay stress-free!

6453006,171789116,2017-07-18,1493361,Kyuhee,Divya was more than ready to help us check-in with helpful points. Her place is clean and great location. Awesome views of the city. 
34063116,488246538,2019-07-14,63303649,Adam,"I stayed for two months at Viona and Pattabi’s house and it was truly wonderful! They are both super friendly and helpful hosts—they were happy to answer questions and give recommendations for my time in the city and immediately made me feel welcome and comfortable in their home. In short it was the perfect place to come back to after work or exploring the city—quiet clean friendly and extremely well located. 

The apartment is recently designed and renovated so everything is new—from the beautiful kitchen to the updated shared bathroom. Everything is spotless and the house is professionally cleaned every two weeks. 

I cannot emphasize enough how perfect the location is. It is steps from the main street in Noe Valley a perpetually sunny and safe neighborhood where you can find shops restaurants a grocery store and a farmer’s market on Saturday. Both the Castro and the Mission are next door and can easily be reached on the major Muni lines that stop right by the house. 

I wish I could have stayed longer and would recommend Viona’s place to anyone visiting the city. Thank you both for an amazing two months!"
15985008,268350996,2018-05-24,41408540,Michael,Such a great choice !!! Easy Uber and transit to all of the San Francisco attractions!  Very clean and well kept will advise to grab this one before it’s gone !!
1774026,117227954,2016-12-05,97688443,Carol,Cedric was very easy to work with and very accommodating.  The location was great and it worked very well for our family wedding.  It was a little more dated than we expected from the pictures which we understand were taken years before.  The use of the garage was very convenient.
15177460,320390864,2018-09-08,2799942,Alexia,Kirsten's flat is stylish and quirky in a great location within walking distance to Haight & Ashbury or Mission. Very comfortable bed and use of second room too.
30022449,458972246,2019-05-26,2032153,Chelsea,"For myself my boyfriend and our friend who stayed at this property the living room was an important spot in this home.  And we knew that going in.  We had a lot planned during the days so having a place to hang together to play games (specifically the Jeopardy app on my Apple TV using our phones as remotes) and eat takeout was essential.  So the two most important things we looked for before booking was a large living space a large television and a large couch.  As we searched it became clear that many of the homes in SF don't have a television and many have futons instead of couches.  Both of these things were potential deal breakers for us especially in this price range.   So when we arrived at this very nice home the first thing we all noticed was the large brown futon in the living room that seemingly had replaced the stunning yellow couch from the photos.  It was exactly what you would expect from a futon which is less stability and comfort and room to fit three people.  It definitely effected the stay.  

I considered not writing a review that included this point as Yvonne did in fact refund a small percentage of our stay because of this issue.  However seeing that the photos are still misrepresenting the space makes me feel some obligation to inform potential guests.

Regarding the rest of our stay the beds were very comfortable the shower pressure was very good the kitchen was stocked with plates cups utensils and appliances and the overall look of the home was nice and cozy.  We didn’t use the laundry at all but it was nice to know it was there just in case.  Getting food delivery through Postmates was no problem at all and the internet was very solid for us.  Yvonne was very available with communication and you really couldn't ask for more in terms of the detail provided for the renter regarding what food is nearby grocery options banks busses and general information...all of which was very helpful."
3441517,462093591,2019-06-01,244736221,Abel,Great spot with accessible parking which is pretty rare in the city. Judith is amazing kind and very thoughtful :)

Right next to a great park with playgrounds for the kids and plenty of great Asian restaurants. The place is very well stocked with all the necessities - thanks for making our quick trip very easy and pleasant!

80394,463022997,2019-06-02,10781872,Martha,Place was great!! Right across from Buena Vista Park and had free street parking that was always available nearby. Tons of coffee shops within walking distance. Would definitely stay here again!
142177,5163284,2013-06-16,6351221,Elizabeth,The flat was spacious luminous well situated with a convenient parking spot.  It was really easy to take the tram to downtown.  We had a few trouble with the glasses ( 3 broke without any reason!) and the kitchen although well equiped needs a little work to be done.  Noreen is a great host as well as her sister that lives just upstairs.  They were always available to give us some practical info.
17424816,213121460,2017-11-19,15434949,Ally,Great location super walkable comfortable stay & great hosts! Carl & Claire were warm & welcoming and their home is full of character thoughtfully currated & a great glimpse of everyday life in the Nopa neighborhood. The pictures & description are spot on but it’s even better in person than we imagined. The room is charming. Communication was prompt and easy. Parking was never too hard to find. Will definitely try to stay here again on our next trip to San Fransisco.
15770116,172372881,2017-07-20,98832415,Kathleen,Lovely home that while historic feels modern. Everything from shops to downtown to tourist attractions are very close by but space is so comfy you can just read a book by the window. Spacious yet cozy. Really enjoyed our time there. Hosts were always available and responded quickly to any question. Highly recommend.
23313532,251898999,2018-04-08,28930576,Michael,Great to have gated parking!
21047729,460215400,2019-05-28,4865041,Alison,Lindsay's spot was perfect for our trip. The location is extremely convenient; very close to transportation shopping  and restaurants.

We would certainly stay there again on future visits.

21974808,226829211,2018-01-12,166271607,Catherine,Definitely a beautiful place! Comfortable secure and like other reviews have stated the attention to details like a great mattress high thread count sheets and towels and sparkling clean rooms add up to a wonderful experience. 
40092,24944671,2015-01-04,10281451,Selwyn,Brian and Leah's place was just perfect about for or trip. GREAT location in the mission meant you could get around town quickly or walk to any of the many local bars restaurants or shops. The place had everything you could need and a comfortable bed and living room to top it off. Thanks for a great stay.
15985008,122461732,2016-12-23,101448829,Sheila,"My daughter and I wanted to spend Christmas in San Francisco and had a wonderful time there.  We used the apt as a base it had everything we needed a cozy bed and bathroom a refrigerator and microwave and an entry that was convenient.  I parked the rental car up the street we always found a spot; thank goodness for GPS or I’d not have been able to navigate San Francisco and find our way back “home”.  

We were busy our entire stay we drove some of Hwy 1 went to the Pt. Reyes lighthouse made it to Napa the Armstrong redwood forest Alcatraz Sausalito and Macy’s.  Our meal at Chloe’s Café was delicious the wait was sort of long.  The food at The Palace was just fine but we enjoyed the Super Duper Hamburgers and Oasis Grill a lot!  We had burgers down the road from our apt and there was good coffee everywhere. 

Jeff was excellent and prompt when we asked about finding our way around going to the mall and getting to the local places to get some groceries.  We were met when we arrived and there were flowers in the apartment which I appreciated.  Thank you to the guys for welcoming us graciously!!

We were greeted by their loving dog Leo and a hand written card and clean towels on the bed. The house is well kept with unique character. Best bathroom ever! 

I appreciated their recommendations to restaurants and their openness to visiting with us when we would return from a long day of exploring. 

I would definitely recommend this location and host to any friends and family visiting the area. We will definitely be back! Thank you for being such gracious hosts."
1615158,70825913,2016-04-21,7022346,Don,Laura was very accommodating with my arrival time and greeted me personally. The room was very relaxing and private. Walking to the MUNI every day and being able to see the ocean on the cross streets was a big benefit.
8352275,101867629,2016-09-15,52347612,Katie,Our host was absolutely delightful! We had a later than usual check in time but he was very accommodating.

3565068,42124155,2015-08-11,9840739,Dan,"This is a classic SF flat stylish and comfortable. It has some impressive architecture featuring high ceilings doors and lots of windows. The kitchen and bathroom are upscale and modern. It is tastefully decorated with plenty of useful SF info handy. The pictures and Air BnB description are accurate.
The home is fine for family of four if one can sleep on the (comfortable) couch.
The home features nice outdoor spaces (deck and garden) as well.
The neighborhood is quite nice with a market and some very good restaurants nearby on Divisadero. It is centrally located and convenient to many things in the city.
Mass transit is right outside (the bus is quiet and the street otherwise not that busy especially at night).
We did not meet Beatrice but she gave us easy entry instructions and house info (her Air BnB guide is most helpful). 
The place was super clean when we arrived and Beatrice was flexible with check in time.

I really appreciated how amazingly clean the house was especially given the shared environment. All the other guests were very quiet and respectful. Check in was easy and step by step detailed instructions were provided. Victor was an excellent host and great to communicate with he was flexible accommodating and quick to respond. Great place to stay for travelers on a budget who want to be close to the city!

1738415,237150775,2018-02-21,48437599,Marilyn,Clean and cozy. Walking distance to lots of resturants and shops. We had our 9 month old with us and it was nice to have a kitchen to clean bottles etc and store food. Parking wasn’t bad. We parked on the street. Just pay attention to steet signs so you know when to move your car. Overall great stay for the price.
4269254,78872250,2016-06-09,52122954,Devorah,"What a wonderful place - delightful! Marjorie was very helpful contacting me before my stay with local tips and travel information as well as details about the apartment and how to reach her for any issues. The apartment itself was cozy and beautifully furnished with everything one could possibly need. From the comfortable bed with luxury yet homey linens to the tasteful decor with adequate lamps heating and extra linens  the spacious closet with plenty of hangers to the high end bath products I felt pampered and very very comfortable. Everything was labeled and easy to find. Marjorie even provided several books about San Francisco and many additional thoughtful details such as a well-stocked coffee and tea station and chocolates. The location is convenient  quiet  and there is a Safeway across the street. I wish I'd had more time to stay and explore the area and some of the helpful and interesting books provided! 

It was clear that someone put a lot of thought and love into making this apartment a homelike and comfortable guest haven. I hope I will have a chance to stay here again during future trips to San Francisco. 

Thank you! "

Kelly is a incredible host and her place it’s lovely!
If you are thinking twice don’t! Definitely choose this place!!!"
81535,5042566,2013-06-09,6483811,Sam,"John was a great host.  I arrived to his apartment MUCH later than planned and he was very accommodating - in fact he met me at the BART station to give me the keys and then walked me through the apartment.

The apartment is exactly as described - clean neat and nice - and less than a minute walk from the Civic Center BART stop.  The sleeping loft area does require the ability to climb a ladder and has a low ceiling - but I had no issue navigating this.

The surrounding area is definitely urban and edgy. but safe if you are aware of your surroundings. 

There are a few good breakfast/coffee places nearby and a great Farmer's Market on M W F right next to the BART station."

My room and bathroom was clean; having access to a normal kitchen fridge and MOST IMPORTANTLY LAUNDRY MACHINE - that was super convenient.  There is a great convenient store down the street where you can get mexican food sodas and snacks! Also nice cafe for coffee+breakfast/lunch across the street from there.
1738415,300265220,2018-08-01,75498568,Josh,Donnas place is much better than we had expected. It is spacious stylish and has some great touches that made us feel at home. Location is perfect; a quiet one way street with no noise and just steps from lots of trendy bars and restaurants. I would definitely recommend anyone visiting San Francisco to stay at Donnas place. Thanks again!

2783251,17043898,2014-08-06,15690684,Emmanuel,L appart est parfaitement fonctionnel et très bien tenu on s y sent bien. De plus il est très bien placé.
2047469,120329149,2016-12-09,76145937,Jordan,Don't miss a chance to book Kenix's place! Even better than described on airbnb. Completely exceeded any and all expectations of a clean and cozy home for the week. Room is extremely well kept as is the bathroom and she provided all needed amenities for the duration of our stay. She even helped us find parking! Would love to stay again!
1480015,335288783,2018-10-11,49953603,Liz,I recommend Ben’s place for anyone visiting San Francisco. Ben is an excellent host the apartment is clean and has everything you would need and the neighborhood is lovely - many restaurants and close to the park. Ben was available for any questions and was super easy and flexible. He made it easy for us to bring our toddler and had a crib and high chair available. Thanks for everything!
1998111,15611057,2014-07-12,6789922,Nadine & Andri,We arrived two days earlier in san francisco than expected. First we worried if we would find a room on such short notice but thanks to the fast acceptance from kenix the worries were gone within moments. The room looks in reality like on the pictures. Threre are 3 other rooms (and 2shared bathrooms) which are rented for guests and so we met some nice people from around the world at the kitchen table. By bus it takes about 45 minutes to get to downtown. The nearest shops and restaurants are just two minutes away by walking.
10385321,90186655,2016-07-31,6777244,Philip,"Robert and his family were absolutely wonderful. While we didn't need anything while staying there they were available if we did. 

They were able to provide an abundance of information about local sites and hotspots as well as information about things to see and do in the bay area. 

The apartment was absolutely adorable and so well kept. We're very much hoping to make a return trip and when we do we'll make sure to stay here again!"
15339049,255183373,2018-04-19,162325703,Maxim,"Pictures don't do justice to this lovely place. Alas I was too busy with work to enjoy the fire pit but Nespresso machine was a savior in morning! Very well appointed and maintained. Lovely area and restaurants / supermarket near by. Just a couple of FYI comments:
* Since it is ground floor your cell phone reception is likely to be weak. Wi-fi worked like a charm so I was connected at all times.
* Driveway angle is somewhat steep (common in SF). I did have a bit of scraping on the undercarriage of my Prius. Be careful if you have a lower clearance vehicle.  
Overall a great experience that very few hotels can rival."
16572187,159044428,2017-06-09,13649665,Giselle,Great and lovely abode in San Francisco. Quiet and easy to access. A joy to stay there. It was wonderfully clean and had all the amenities we needed. Very cute neighborhood. Sarah was a great host and was available if we needed but left us to our own privacy. 
6423158,57633643,2015-12-28,44879060,Diana,she text us when we arrived and I was very happy to see how very comfortable her apt studio was ! We had a very nice time and the studio was Exceptionelly nice clean quit.
2355859,242413907,2018-03-11,128557556,Kayla,Great neighborhood nice place and friendly host!
8167459,133596304,2017-02-23,107290279,Natalie,Michelle has been very kind during our stay she accommodated to our voiced needs and was available when required. Nice location be prepared to search for parking or walk a few blocks. The neighbourhood is charming but quite condensed and busy. Thank you for having us Michelle!
2771128,14159172,2014-06-13,14776612,François,Excellent stay at Stephanie's home. The apartment is gorgeous ideally situated. Every detail is well organized. I hope to come back soon!
1627455,121386706,2016-12-16,103373037,Greg,Felt very welcomed
7715542,570525942,2019-11-29,213712905,Georgia,The studio on Polk street has everything you need for a comfortable stay with an incredible location. It is very cosy and compact but thoughtful touches like the tiny but well equipped kitchenette and spacious closet to store our suitcases made it a very easy place to stay. Communication with Michael was prompt and friendly. I highly recommend the Studio on Polk!
657121,179547559,2017-08-07,125045808,Julissa,"Trevor's place exceeded my expectations.  San Francisco is a beautiful city.  Staying at his place allowed my family to indulge to the  fullest extent the charm and quaint character of this vivacious city.  The city views were spectacular; the home feeling vibrant. 
Thank you Trevor for wonderful memories."
18615032,503291586,2019-08-05,57167159,Brandon,"Rudy's first level studio apartment is centrally located in SF. We took many trips from the nearby MUNI historical street cars and subway. We felt safe walking the streets of the popular Castro neighborhood at dark. The streets are clean and transportation is less than 3 blocks away. Highly suggest using the MUNI app and purchasing the 1-day passes each day. 

As for the apartment we couldn't ask for a better place for our 3 night trip. The place was clean and well stocked. The bath towels are the best I've ever used — soft and thick. From the city sights and a clean safe place to rest our heads we were on cloud 9."
18873472,444311131,2019-04-27,102902367,Meikai,This apartment is great! Right across from UCSF Parnassus and with many food choices eastbound on Irving. The N train is literally right outside the apartment which makes it extremely convenient to get downtown (~15 minutes to the SOMA area). Above all this is a really safe area and I never felt scared walking outside at 3am. Highly recommended.
28610502,457746964,2019-05-24,51974880,Ben,Awesome location close to BART great apartment for what we needed during our stay. Space to cook a simple meal comfortable bed and a parking spot.  Very affordable for a stay in San Fransisco!
6365190,47914546,2015-09-21,44307279,Mike,I had a great experience staying at his place.  He was very responsive in replying all communications. The room and bathroom was clean. It made everything easy.
14553693,165087015,2017-06-30,55681676,Victoria,Wonderful host. Personal welcome and great tips on the neighbourhood. The room is smaller but appointed very well. The location is perfect for exploring Haight Ashbury and other parts of San Francisco great restaurants nearby. 
77175,85474411,2016-07-11,78415072,James,"Tyler and Shoreh made us feel very welcome in their home during our recent stay in San Francisco.  The studio apartment met all of our needs and was very comfortable. We had rented a car and found parking very easy even though we arrived on a street cleaning day.
Be prepared for a climb up the hill though should you arrive by nearby public transportation.   Both a BART station and city buses were in close walking distance from the apartment so we had no need for our car during our stay.
When Tyler and Shoreh found an item we left behind they contacted us immediately and mailed it on to our home.
We would definitely check for availability of this studio apartment on any return trip to San Francisco. "
1484792,69496434,2016-04-11,1777314,Eric,Mario was an incredible host. Everything went smoothly and his place is beautiful!
10840593,138654610,2017-03-20,37580273,Brett,"This is a great apartment located in a nice neighborhood. While it's a little out of the way of public transportation it's an easy 20 minute walk to the 24th Street Bart station in the Mission. The home is comfortable and well-furnished. There are 3 beds and also a comfortable bed roll that can be used in the living room. We had a very nice stay and the host was friendly and helpful. There are only two things that were not quite ideal: first being a basement apartment there are no windows and the air circulation isn't great. Second the shower head is very low so tall people like myself (over 6' 2"") have to kneel or sit in the bathtub to use the shower. But those are very minor inconveniences in an overall wonderful place!"
2020393,101907311,2016-09-15,274518,Katharina,"We were really comfortable staying here. The apartment is spacious and cozy at the same time. We loved eating breakfast in the bright kitchen and watching the hummingbirds feeding on the deck outside.
Sandra and her partner were very accomodating and helped us quickly when we had some issues.
We also liked the neigborhood. Mission District is a colourful neighborhood packed with nice little shops eateries and gorgeous murals. "
1992217,11588685,2014-04-08,12655225,Sean,We stayed at Peter's place last weekend and enjoyed it very much. The rooms are kept very clean and Peter's breakfast is healthy and tasty. The place is walking distance away from Valencia and Guerrero where many restaurants are located. Highly recommended!
20361588,311168437,2018-08-20,1447051,Samuel,"The place is a gem.
Quiet clean spacious in a safe neighborhood. Very difficult to find something like that in SF. We were quite pleased."
9225,159087734,2017-06-09,25732370,Maryam,Gae is an incredible and highly interesting host. Being a lover and maker of art myself I thoroughly enjoyed all her artworks in her intriguing house. Thanks for having us
1125079,209977399,2017-11-06,105651534,Lynden,Clean quiet comfortable and very accommodating. Great place to stay I look forward to my trips here!
30885309,567511242,2019-11-22,287094083,Ryan,Excellent stay at Adam & Helene's
6245649,141582326,2017-04-03,24717294,Han,"Location is great - just a few blocks from the beach. Great places to eat a mere block away - we didn't have to really drive at all during our stay as most everything we needed was very conveniently located. Plus the main Judah Muni line allowed us to travel to most places we wanted to go.

Parking can be a trial during the weekend and evenings but if you don't have a car that won't be applicable to you.

Overall a great experience cozy and comfortable. Would definitely stay again!"
394575,1534747,2012-06-22,2265984,Genevieve,My family was visiting me in SF and we found this studio well decorated and that comfortably accomodated my family of 4. Mike the renter was very flexible about checkin and checkout times and was available for any questions. My family really enjoyed this place. 
4527553,129972860,2017-02-03,11002367,Gregg,I just completed my second week-long visit and it was wonderful.  A great find on airbnb!
14884457,117086160,2016-12-04,51158426,Matthew,Very great host. She went above and beyond to makr sure my stay was great. If i needee anything she would respond via text within mintues. The location is excellent.  When i was having problems with my car her husband helped me. Her husband is very nice aswell
16454916,323086870,2018-09-14,47609298,Jorinde + Wouter,Very clean cottage comfy bed and from there a beautiful view by night and the sunrise was also stunning! Loved the place and the garden. Has hummingbirds around the house. Neighborhood is very nice as well.
207980,215797775,2017-12-01,14892895,Prabhath,Beautiful view and very nice quiet neighborhood. The place is wonderful with a huge kitchen and eating space. Rooms are large and spacious. Would definitely recommend!
13585679,238482442,2018-02-25,159148345,Nick,Cynthia is a lovely host very friendly and accommodating and the apartment is bright and clean and very comfortable.  Depending on where you're coming from the Mission District itself where the apartment is located is pretty colourful but I never felt unsafe.  Close to the BART train to head into the city it's super convenient there are restaurants everywhere and the whole area just has a massive amount of personality.  I'd recommend it and happily stay here again.
10767861,254465568,2018-04-16,56622990,Dafne,Excelente ubicación Vishal y Maji súper amables y amigables 
12154878,202093021,2017-10-09,417208,Manon,Fabulous location (safe and convenient) unbeatable price. The beds are right up against the outside wall so there is noise coming from the street and it feels a little exposed. Four of us stayed here for three nights and it was intimate but not at all uncomfortable. It is a large space. Everything was clean and the beds were comfy.
57676,16271081,2014-07-24,2518768,Sari,Seb and Jess were truly lovely guests! Their place is amazing and super well located. Loved meeting the other guests and the whole experience. Highly recommended! 
1281132,213555635,2017-11-21,21284528,Elizebeth,This place was amazing! Clean quiet cozy. We had all a great little kitchen to cook in. We had easy access to Bernal heights and to other neighborhoods. Soo great. Hands down my favorite place to stay so far. We loved it!
14426130,97485800,2016-08-27,76670851,Tony,Great home away from the very busy downtown San Fran but only a short bus uber or drive away. The house is very clean and remodeled by David. David does a great job of listing everything you need to know about staying at his house from how to enter and exit the home travelling across the city and the great foods around the block. David's dog Desmo is great companion to have around the house. Great great location for those new to the city. Nearby places we checked out were the Golden Gate Park the Ocean Beach and Lands End. One thing I would recommend is to find parking earlier in the day before everyone comes home and to uber/bus it across town. It only cost $8-9 to Uber pool it to Mission District. 
16896129,148452826,2017-04-30,11951670,Nathan,The apartment smelled strongly of mold. We could not stay there. The host and I negotiated a partial refund which she surreptitiously deducted half of her fee to Airbnb after we agreed on a different amount.
13687128,210672674,2017-11-10,97774414,Dean,Great spot close to Moscone. D was mindful considerate and accommodating. 5-stars!
72444,121374774,2016-12-16,101102197,Zhengxie,This is the first time I live in a hostel. It is an intimate community. You can meet with different people come to stay for different purposes. It is an economical choice.
33969322,492890775,2019-07-21,148191471,Mary,Hotel is city center close to shopping and great restaurants. Easy access to public transportation. Staff friendly and welcoming. Security was good and I felt safe going in and out of hotel. Room was spacious for a historic building. Very quiet and clean. Valet parking was worth extra charge. Large garage right next to hotel had easy access and plenty of room.  With taxes fees and valet averaged about 80 dollars a night for each of us (4 in room) to stay in  downtown San Francisco. I don’t think that’s is bad.
28105604,426012544,2019-03-19,15181524,Joey,Reminded me of the house in “Up” a perfect house with modern amenities tucked in its own garden. Great spot to stay in the city near public transit and great food.
114401,38660378,2015-07-17,14408720,Christian,"George was a terrific host and very attentive. He not only set up an ironing board and iron in my room but also helped find me a dry cleaner with a quick turnaround. 

The room is comfortable and on a quiet block in the Castro. It's a quick walk to Muni and a very short uber/cab ride to BART if you're crunched for time.

I would not hesitate to stay with George again when I'm in the Bay Area for work."
13128357,358034128,2018-12-12,55401673,Austin,Excellent stay. Construction going on wasn’t bad. Beautiful views!
9532943,464886602,2019-06-06,241899121,Lissie,Great location! Just in the downtown city center. No keys needed so very convenient. Thank you!
17925808,322635787,2018-09-13,191572586,Dan,A lovely place in the middle of San Francisco with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge from your bedroom window. There is great transport links into and around the city on nearby Van Ness avenue and Lilliana was always quick and helpful when responding to messages! Would recommend
24129914,418285357,2019-03-01,234188853,Kris,Beautiful space large kitchen super clean and a great location.
9051149,149927644,2017-05-06,99636841,Marcela,Fuimos en pareja y todo fue perfecto! La cama muy cómoda y todas los detalles tanto en la habitación como en la cocina hicieron la estadía muy reconfortante! 5 estrellas! Elmer fue un anfitrión muy amable y estuvo atento a nuestras necesidades! Lo elegiríamos nuevamente sin dudar! 
17288739,296873076,2018-07-26,193685322,Hanjo,Great San Francisco style apartment with garden. Very nice and big for a family of five. Detailed descriptions and recommendations from the host. We had a wonderful time there!
13788581,245827587,2018-03-23,268541,Bruce,"Ryan's place is ideal if you're visiting SF for a few days just nearby Divisadero street and just a few minutes away from Fillmore street. The flat has all the amenities to make you feel just like at home. Ryan was an ideal host available and prompt to answer all my queries.

If there was anything to call out it would only be the neighbors and their very young children who live above the flat they are very active and will run around all day starting at dawn even during weekends...if you are looking for a very quiet place to relax this may not be ideal."
41423,939515,2012-02-21,1745798,Steve,"Carrie was a wonderful host. And the place was perfect for us... just as described... Carrie thank you for the use of your wonderful cottage this past weekend. Your place was so warm clean comfortable and easy to get to/from (it was the ideal location/accomodation for us)... We had a blast in San Francisco and really appreciate staying at your cottage!

992676,68076625,2016-04-02,49066507,Matthias,"We had a great stay with Kate everything was just perfect comfortable and very clean. Kate is a very welcoming host and it was a pleasure to stay here. Highly recommended!
Thank you very much Kate."
25798231,526914753,2019-09-09,16458841,Seth,"Aziz's place was great for our stay.  Two bedrooms with each have their own bathrooms worked well since we hat two separate groups of people staying.  The apartment as well as the building are styled well and the apartment had some nice views of the skyline.  

There are a couple of good coffee places down the block and the place is in a convenient location to a lot of other things in the city if you don't mind some walking or taking the Muni system around town which has a stop a block away."
21000319,521274498,2019-08-31,59523127,Emily,Everything went smoothly communication was easy logistics worked and place was great.

83257,444302492,2019-04-27,2733314,Diana,KImberly and Ahmed are lovely hosts generous and hospitable. Their home is cozy and comfortable and feels like a home away from home. Their location is perfect for getting around easily in the city. You will definitely enjoy your stay .

6156195,34233818,2015-06-06,33861694,Alice,Beautiful newly renovated apartment; very clean! It's located in a great neighbourhood with lots of cafes and restaurants. There is a wonderful grocery store just around the corner. The hosts are thoughtful and quickly respond to any questions or needs one might have. We stayed there with our two little daughters and it was perfect! We highly recommend this place.
1433917,194371172,2017-09-16,3218858,Maxence,"Great airbnb perfectly located. The apartment is clean neatly decorated and the owners very attentive. 
The bedroom is surprisingly quiet for the area. I would highly recommend renting it."
20803354,443784568,2019-04-26,174478472,T.K,Sion’s place is awesome! There’s a big comfy bed gorgeous bathroom and  every thought details you can imagine. I’ve stayed here again and again for my business trips. It’s so close to BART and I felt very safe and at home at Sion’s place. She’s so nice and thoughtful and I look forward to my next stay at her place. Thank you Sion!
21935870,270609663,2018-05-29,76661688,Erin,Olivia & Dan’s place was just as pictured online. Everything was very clean the bed was unbelievably comfortable the extra closest room was perfect to store all of our stuff the double sink in the bathroom was very convenient the big TV was perfect to watch the NBA playoffs and the outside area was a huge plus! On a nice day it was perfect to sit out there and enjoy some sun.  Will definitely come back to stay here again!
10089183,208921012,2017-11-03,9643934,Duska,It's a gem ... I love those small yet wonderfully functional places. It has a super cozy feel with it's vintage touches in furniture and decoration. And having lovely products in the bathroom makes it feel exactly like 'home away from home' without any sense of intruding on someone's privacy. Exactly how Airbnb should feel like :-)))
23044309,356579193,2018-12-08,32935047,Mimi,Great stay in the Castro area of SF. Noom was very responsive and overall a great host. Would recommend for anyone looking for a cute spot in the city!
12725886,545623825,2019-10-12,150898850,Andre,Debbie is a great host. The area is full of Good restaurants and Golden Gate Park just minutes away.

8155586,76584944,2016-05-28,43664109,Shana,We enjoyed staying in Kevin and Jose's home very much.  Easy access to drive places and the beds were comfy. 
4387067,189120688,2017-08-31,33561203,Meredith,This place is fantastic I would absolutely stay here again! The neighborhood is everything that you look for in an Airbnb- convenient to all things but hip and residential. The space is light and airy the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom brand new. They also provided us with great recommendations for restaurants (Jane for breakfast must do!) Thank you for an amazing stay we will be back!
24497818,307124245,2018-08-13,63111507,Katharine,"Very easy to move in—bed already made with sheets (and extra clean sheets and towels in the closet!). Nice kitchen with just what you need to get cooking and Tupperware too! Lots of natural light. 
Only complaint is the pillows were a little flat and the neighborhood isn’t that nice but it is convenient."
678556,522903000,2019-09-02,93635038,Aaron,Wonderful little place near Golden Gate park.  Great location to get to anywhere in the city and Lorraine provides you with two Clipper cards to use on the bus if you wish.  Lorraine is so nice as is her pet dog Kimo!  Will definitely recommend to anyone planning to visit the wonderful city of San Francisco.
22548614,534548064,2019-09-22,192748300,Amy,Judy's place was great. Very close to The Castro district. Would stay again.
14990478,279789145,2018-06-21,35661425,Donald,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Eddie and Chip’s cozy little bungalow. Well situated to the BART as well as nice restaurants within walking distance. Chip’s garden is beautiful.
6716133,218276772,2017-12-11,47430884,Tina,"I highly recommend the Suite retreat to anyone considering staying here at its location a little outside the more ""downtown"" neighborhoods.  The suite does not have a grand or sweeping view- it's located on the ground floor of a house built into a hillside and looks out onto the rock face and a terrace area there.  Beside that you'll find yourself in a true San Francisco neighborhood hilly streets super great views to both east and west and a diverse and friendly bunch of residents.  Shopping is a short hike downhill to the Ocean Ave area where you can easily catch any number of SF Municipal buses and streetcars (and a BART station a short distance the other way that is connected not only to the airport but downtown in 9 minutes and East Bay locations as well).  I did not Uber as I am a former SF resident and love our Muni for its service and pricing) but Uber is all over if your prefer getting around that way. 

The suite itself was convenient and clean.  The bed was super comfy and the kitchenette was outfitted with enough equipment to cook as large a meal as you might like.  My first night's dinner with friends was a bust so I walked to the Target Market a few blocks beyond the Whole Foods and picked up dinner ingredients not just heat and eat stuff and made a nice meal.  There are some condiments in the kitchen and tea and coffee to use and some snack bars you are welcome to eat as well. The welcome book is short yet tells you pretty much everything you need to know and Deborah the host was available by text if needed.  Communicating with her throughout the stay was really good.

The bathroom is supercool an oval tub/shower combo and modern decor. Towels fluffy and absorbent water temperature and pressure great. 

I was a single traveler. You could have two people in the suite but that's really about the maximum. I'd say its best suited to someone traveling on business who doesn't necessarily need or want to be in the midst of tourist San Francisco.  If you take the time to walk the neighborhood you'll get great views as well as a true sense of how the ""real"" people live and enjoy this great city plus you can get anywhere else you need or would like to be in minutes.

I did have a car for the 2 days I needed to travel south to the Peninsula.  You will be on the freeway past all the in-town traffic further north in SF in about 3 minutes and getting back from a trip south you similarly are getting off before a lot of the in town congestion. Worth a LOT!

Bottom line: If you don't need a personal View Window but want a solid good place to stay for your time in and around San Francisco I think you'd be happy here."
8584000,120088302,2016-12-07,2340420,Adrian,"Amy's place is quite nice and exactly as shown in the pictures.  Communication with Amy & Marian was great and check-in/out were simple and easy.  The location worked well for us too and it made for a great base for our SF vacation.

Upsides: lots of light nice touches throughout awesome heated floors and the serious tea selection.

Minor Downsides: street noise - you definitely hear what's happening outside- whether its a garbage truck collecting trash at 7 am or people screaming as they walk by.  It is quiet overnight though which is when it matters most.

heat in the main room - the floors there aren't currently heated so that room depends entirely on the hallway heater for warmth in the evening.  Given the heater's location and the sizes of the rooms you had to choose between comfortable bedroom & cool main room or overly hot bedroom & comfortable main room. "
19050152,438855016,2019-04-17,26770583,Alan,This is a nice home. The location is in a residential area on the hills of Bayview. You can expect all the amenities in the room you will find at a 5 star hotel. Parking is convenient outside the garage entrance. Sandeep and his family are very nice and helpful

585225,168489472,2017-07-09,74932425,Rohit,Bright clean and conveniently located spot in Noe Valley. I would happily stay here again.
1033754,5598781,2013-07-08,5721041,Jennifer,"Great home especially for families. Close to activities like the beach Golden Gate Park SF Zoo look out point and hiking trails near Cliff house and others. The home was equipped with most everything we needed. We found it was very helpful to rent a car and we were glad that the home had parking spaces.
 Jennifer was very helpful and wrote us by email often to check in. The cost for renting is very reasonable and the backyard was very large especially one in the city.

Outer Sunset is great for families like ours with three kids that need space to run and jump. My husband and I woke up early walked down the street to get coffee and a stroll on the beach.

The only draw back I would say is that it would have been nice to have an extra bathroom. Coming from Montreal and renting homes around the world the home is exactly how you see it online. The neighborhood is diverse and if you come from a large metropolitan city you will appreciate its value. Space is a premium especially for this city and you indeed have enough of it at least for our family of five."
20424542,228647130,2018-01-20,25869652,Rachel,I loved my stay! The apartment was exactly as pictured - very clean with a great kitchen stocked with appliances and pots/pans two closets and a bathroom with shower. The space is just the right size for 1-2 people well-designed and had everything I needed for a three-week stay. The apartment is in a great neighborhood - beautiful and safe and it is only about a 6 min walk to the Muni station (you can get downtown in 15-20 mins). There was a welcome packet with everything I needed to know and Michael was quick to respond throughout the entire process. I highly recommend this place for a visit (short- or long-term) to SF!
5154242,37297652,2015-07-06,7187716,Kosta,"Zimmer war bei Ankunft sehr sauber. Annie und ihre Familie sind sehr zuvorkommend und aufmerksam und lassen einen von Ankunft bis abreise komplett in Ruhe. Komplex besteht aus mehreren Zimmern eine ""Küche"" kann gemeinsam genutzt werden. Waren nur zum schlafen im Zimmer. Wände sind allerdings sehr dünn und extrem hellhörig wir hatten leider das Pech ein Pärchen als ""Nachbar"" zu haben welches Tag und Nacht ""aktiv"" war das war nicht so toll. Sichere Umgebung mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln ist das Stadtzentrum in ca 30 min erreichbar. "
16204265,343758107,2018-11-01,56664333,Finn,Koncha’s place was incredibly comfortable and exactly what we were after in an Airbnb. Koncha was very accomodating to our strange arrival and departure times which made us much less stressed. Pokey was a great addition to the place and never got in the way only added to the charm. Definitely would stay here again!
8187584,53601439,2015-11-10,463716,Ben & Becky,Ed was a great host and greeted us with much friendliness and even when we had to call him at 11pm when the lock to the room broke he did everything right and we had a new lock the very next day. The room was perfect just as described and we had a great time there. The location is great just two blocks from the J and a 10-minute walk from BART and the neighborhood is friendly and charming.
32866238,491851703,2019-07-20,56189859,Miguel,Lovely place. Would definitely recommend. Adela and Giancarlo were really helpful with everything and their place is lovely and private.
3221082,236658814,2018-02-19,10788381,Kate,Andrea’s place was just as expected and she was available for any inquiries during the stay! Loved that there is a guitar and piano - bonus!
598579,3244962,2013-01-03,249905,Atsuko,"I and my boyfriend really enjoyed staying at Bob's apartment! We occasionally use airbnb while I visit him during vacation but this place is the one of our favorite. Bob and Sue are sweet and very helpful.
The apartment was neat and had everything we wanted.
Location is also ideal for tourists. It is close to bus stops for downtown Castro Mission Haight Ashbury Golden Gate Park etc. and the famous painted ladies is just several  steps away! 
I strongly reccomend this place and definitely want to come back:)
 
"
4026354,27074599,2015-02-24,20090727,Michelle,Candy was a great host. She was easy to communicate with and quickly answered any questions I had. The apartment was very clean and perfect for all our needs. Candy even reserved a parking space for us as we had a rental car. I would recommend Candy's place.
12110830,109978572,2016-10-23,18168010,Dawn,"This was a great experience for us especially with a toddler in tow.  We could easily baby proof with a few simple adjustments and feel comfortable and relaxed.  Because the apartment was modest and cozy it wasn't too precious that we had to worry about ruining anything. There is also a great playground just a couple blocks away.  
Zoila was very welcoming and easy to communicate with.  One funny detail to note is that the bed while comfortable is squeaky.   So getting into bed next to our toddler sleeping next to us in a portable crib was kind of a delicate activity.
The area was good for us because we were right near family but it isn't necessarily a destination spot otherwise.  "
749990,129702596,2017-02-01,19446263,Zami,"I moved to SF from London and spent my first month in a new city living in Arthur's beautiful home. I cannot recommend this place enough. 

The apartment itself is exactly as advertised. It's spotless warm comfortable and from on-site laundry to complimentary shampoo has all the facilities and supplies anyone could need arriving in a new place. It's also really private and secure what with it's own security code locked entrance. As a young woman I felt super comfortable arriving home alone late at night. 

The neighborhood is awesome. Divisadero is lined with grocery stores corner shops and some of the best restaurants in the city. The nearby Panhandle is perfect for morning runs and the stunning Golden Gate Park is within walking distance too. What's more buses into Downtown and out to popular neighborhoods like the Castro stop just a block away. 

Arthur himself was an outstanding host. When I arrived hours sooner than expected he easily gave me early access to the place. When a storm knocked the power out Arthur was super communicative and got everything fixed so quickly I hardly noticed the problem! 

I cant recommend this place enough. For groups on holiday or lone guests finding their feet it really is a great temporary home."

She was so hospitable and friendly and left us with espresso milk and a couple of beers. The house was clean and perfectly located to all the Haight has to offer. We hope to return in the near future...
26305824,328992840,2018-09-27,476932,Amy,David's place was incredibly clean modern with many amenities. Also the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in – I swear I slept just as well as I do at home. They were incredibly quick to respond to any questions or needs I had. Also there's a great restaurant across the street called Bellota!
17606766,300277492,2018-08-01,49931115,Bill,Tremendous location less than a mile from Gold Gate Park.  Kitchen was well stocked; we much enjoyed the fruit cups.  Quiet safe neighborhood.
17301015,183970000,2017-08-18,35557083,Sara,"Micheal's place is very cozy and clean. 
We had a nice room and a private bathroom.
We could use the kitchen to cook and to eat our meals.
You can reach the ferry building in about 35 minutes by tram (the stop is at 5 minutes walking from the house).
The airport is quite near (30 minutes).
Even if we arrived at about midnight Micheal waited for us in order to give us some useful information.
In the room you can find a nice guest guide.
We enjoy stayed here and we do really recommend that place!

2532756,16554009,2014-07-29,16217168,Sam,"Juan was an exceptional host. He gave me plenty of personal space while always making himself available any time I needed a helpful suggestion about the city. He even went so far as to allow me to keep my bag at his place past my check-out time so that I didn't have to lug around a huge piece of luggage on my last day. He didn't have to do that but he did. Overall I would highly recommend Juan as a host because he is respectful and he was very accommodating.

The room was immaculate and spacious. The pillow I slept on was especially comfortable—I ended up asking Juan exactly where he got it. Juan made the kitchen available to me all week and I had my own set of keys to the apartment. "
18960282,471019435,2019-06-16,152713804,Camilla,Sarah and her family are phenomenal! If you’re in the San Francisco area I definitely recommend staying here. The bed is super comfy the shower is really nice check in/out is super easy & the location is perfect. Sarah is a great host who is quick with responses & has great suggestions about places to check out in the city. If my partner  & I are ever in the area again we would stay here again.

14153586,200499946,2017-10-05,57015917,Jan,Really quiet place with great air - nice sleep guaranteed. The house is old (as Monica warned) and looks a bit worn out. That should not surprise you as it is clearly communicated. Downtown ~20 minutes by bus. Ideal for morning runs if you are in such type of things. Monica was feeling sick so we didnt have much opportunities to talk but whenever we met for few minutes it was pleasant conversation.

17405370,454197013,2019-05-17,14698161,Vy,"Peter’s unit was close to perfect for our short trip to SF. You can’t beat this location close to Fisherman’s Wharf public transit and a CVS yet still very safe and quiet. The apartment had everything we needed and more including tools amenities kitchenware even seasoning and condiments you name it. 

At check-in Peter was very friendly in welcoming us. The list of restaurants that Peter and his wife frequent and recommend is a nice bonus. 

I would definitely stay here again!"

3105998,493653159,2019-07-22,5688761,Andrew,I never met Justin but he provided clear and detailed instructions which made check-in very straightforward. The bed was comfortable the kitchen and living area were well equipped and the location was fairly convenient. There was a bit of noise outside at night occasionally mostly on the weekend but most of the time it was fine. There was a rather yappy little dog next-door though who got rather excited when I came or left.

Cathy's home is clean and the bed is awesome. We had the whole of the downstairs area to use including access to the kitchen. We also had exclusive use of the bathroom. 

Coffee tea is available as well as cereal toast for breakfast. Cathy was happy for us to put items in the refrigerator as well. We were also able to park our rental car in the driveway. 

Cathy was the perfect host. "

1725853,31786243,2015-05-10,12710678,Emily,"We were 3 adults (incl 1 couple) who stayed in the apartment for 2 nights. 

The space was comfortable and had all the necessary facilities. The unit is a separate space underneath the main part of the house fully self-contained and accessed through the garage. 

We really liked the clean fresh decor and the location was good walking distance to restaurants as well as a bus and tram stop for transportation into the city (about 30 mins). We walked to the Parkside Tavern (an Irish Pub) on both nights for great cocktails super friendly bartenders and very reasonably priced food. 

Alex met us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment and he was very courteous and respectful. He also went out of his way to organize a late check-out for us combined with an early check-in for the next guests all on Mother's Day! We were able to leave our luggage securely for the morning which was very convenient for us. 

We would definitely recommend this place."

-Great free street parking
-Perfect location with lots of fun eateries around
-Very comfy bed
-Coffee tea sparkling water provided
-Felt very private and secluded.

Cons
-Not as clean and pristine as the photos. Also lots of the furniture is different than in the photos and there is a dresser now instead of the couch.
-Smelled like weed much of the time we were there. There are 3 air purifiers in the home which we ran the whole time but it didn't get rid of the smell. I'm pregnant and found it to be negative but I'm sure a lot of other people wouldn't mind at all!
-Flat pillows - just bring your own if you want! 

Overall our stay was pleasant and we had a great time. It's a perfect place for 1-2 guests."

1510363,8789191,2013-11-18,260725,Allison,I booked Tedd and Charlesie's apartment for family members that were visiting from out of town. Everything was perfect. When my family arrived they were greeted by a spotlessly clean space as well as snacks and drinks. We could really tell that Tedd and Charlesie had put a lot of care into creating a wonderful space for guests. Communication with them during my family's stay was quick and easy and I really felt that they went above and beyond to make sure that we had everything we needed. We would definitely book this apartment again. Thanks!

22586319,237130110,2018-02-21,129157937,Erin,Apartment was clean and a short drive to get to most major attractions. Host allowed us to park in the driveway and was very fast with communication. We also found parking around the corner on the second night. The only minor complaint would be that the walls are very thin. You can hear people upstairs and next to you but since we were hardly there except for sleeping and showering it wasn't a big deal.
24777563,347093840,2018-11-10,32455909,Anna,If you're visiting San Francisco this place is definitely affordable. You pretty much get what you pay for. We spent our days mostly out of the AirBnB and use it just to sleep. It's a great place for backpackers.

3013520,17685088,2014-08-16,9368765,Nefeli,The flat has a great price compared to what you find around in San Fran. It is a basement flat and even though it has a window it is not enough to circulate air. So it did feel a bit suffocating in August. We had some issues with the cleaning but Monty was very helpful and since we were too tired to wake up early and  and welcome a cleaning lady we agreed with Monty for a refund on the cleaning which he did as soon as we returned home and asked for it. The flat had hot water all the time and a nice bed with clean sheets. Neighborhood was a bit far for the city centre but very safe and very easy to get around with the bus. Very close to the Golden Gate park which is amazing . Also Mel's diner is a traditional american diner 5 min awaywith great food and 50's atmosphere. Worth to say that the owner was always available through mail or phone so we felt like he was taking care of various issues.

18874472,173725420,2017-07-23,23487306,Jason,Kathy is very warm and welcome. She stayed up late to wait for me to check in. She also prepared breakfast for me even at 7 am in the morning (since I had to wake up early for marathon). The room is spacious and bed is warm and comfy. Thank you Kathy :)
2016198,18238940,2014-08-24,1790150,Jade,"Char and Rus' house is in a lovely neighbourhood near the beach in Sunset. Although it is out of downtown San Fran there are very good tram links into town making it around 45mins to get anywhere. The house is full of character with their eccentric collections of art books and oddities. The room itself is private reasonably spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was also comfortable and private and had soaps for us to use.

Char and Rus were away when we arrived and we didnt get to meet them during our stay. Unfortunately the room was not cleaned when we arrived and the cleaner arrived at 11pm that night after we had gone to bed clearly due to some sort of misunderstanding on her part. It was difficult to contact the hosts despite leaving messages and we finally got in touch the day we checked out. They were very understanding apologetic and happy to refund some of the cost."

Un équipement remarquablepour la cuisine et un équipement audio vidéo complet avec accès aux diffèrents sites de streaming.Un emplacement très pratique a proximité du parc du Golden Bridge accès facile au centre villeUn stationnement facile .J ai beaucoup apprécié l esprit RBandB car Lauwrence occupe réellement cet appartement ce qui permet de disposer de nombreux produits culinaires qu il met à disposition et à cet appartement d avoir une « âme «  contrairement aux appartements dédiés à la location que je trouve souvent très impersonnel
238190,471048846,2019-06-16,249956026,David,Great location for exploring N San Francisco. Just a few blocks from so many places that visitors want to see. The description provided by the host (Bill) is very accurate. We enjoyed our stay. Faith and Dave
27832283,409789172,2019-02-08,121404255,Mike,Decent place to stay in SF for the price! Wish the back door locked!
479072,281875986,2018-06-25,43541212,Ryan,Overall a very good listing. Convenient to the Castro and in a quiet neighborhood. The unit is pretty spacious and had everything you need to have a comfortable stay while away from home. My partner and I had a wonderful time in SF and this listing contributed to that.  Also very good value for the location. Yes the kids upstairs do run around in the morning from time to time but nothing too disruptive. Recommend this space for any visitors to SF. Viola was very friendly when we ran into her as well and very communicative.
4013746,154441781,2017-05-24,83756487,Marcy,The house was nice and had everything we needed.  The beds were real comfortable and had nice space for a studio!!  We only saw Chuck and Sue at checkin and they were so nice and had so much good information for us.  The house was close to the buses and there was a grocery store and little shops nearby.
20981346,251816422,2018-04-08,115364477,Liz,Nice clean apartment in a nice area of the city. A short walk to the BART made getting into the city really easy. Very easy check in and check out instructions made everything easy! Would definitely recommend and would definitely book again. Thanks!
17281042,317146061,2018-09-01,33065011,Wren,Excellent location between North Beach and Fisherman’s Wharf with grocery stores restaurants and bike rentals all within a 1-block radius. This is very well-appointed condo for the price with a beautiful kitchen that makes you want to cook gourmet meals while drinking wine. Great space for a family or two couples.

21082676,322306357,2018-09-12,198035380,Jenna,I highly recommend staying at Jonathan’s place! The space is gorgeous and in a fantastic location. He was super accessible with communication before and during the stay the room was comfortable the entire place was clean and checking in and out was very easy. This is an especially good pick for cat lovers - if you show interest in Miss Kittin she’ll be an excellent hostess and show lots of affection in return! Thanks Jonathan and Christian!!
878935,55657724,2015-12-04,2380898,Alejandra,I can only say wonderful things about our experience staying here. Ashley was super thoughtful in her responses prior to our arrival (making it so much easier to plan!) and went above and beyond once we arrived. She had a travel crib set up for my youngest son toys available in the closet for the boys a high chair and even kiddie cups and plates in the kitchen!!! Amazing. We are so very grateful! You made all the difference in our stay in the city. The neighborhood is awesome too. We were able to walk around some and had a few really good meals nearby (plus lots of places do take out so it was super convenient). The apartment is very cozy and comfortable and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and recommend it. 
34477166,550478854,2019-10-18,87374169,Will,Tim’s place was spotless and communication was seamless. We enjoyed our 2 night visit in San Francisco and appreciated the convenience of the location. Thanks Tim!
937842,61839850,2016-02-08,38969301,Michael,Nice apartment. Near a lot of great eateries and bars in the Mission District. Our hosts were great!
8859249,438049831,2019-04-15,61264693,Sarah,This place is adorable and just the right size for us (2 adults our 6 year old child and small dog). The apartment was so clean and included thoughtful touches like a coffee set up. We loved the location just off golden gate park and appreciated Erika and Gary’s recommendations and local tips. Communication was a breeze as was check in and check out. We had a car with us and finding street parking in the neighborhood was never an issue. Would stay again!
33783996,499628983,2019-07-31,78521756,Jessy,"This place is amazing! Clean cute modern and nicely decorated and furnished. We instantly felt at home on the first night.

2 blocks away from mission street which had lots of cheap and authentic food places. Though mission street was a bit of a rough area to walk alone walking with a group of people was fine. 

Price for this big space was really good. Definitely worth it."

31803551,536017259,2019-09-25,27392222,Catherine,Very conveniently located and spotlessly clean. We had a great time staying in San Francisco and enjoyed the proximity of Svetha’s place to many restaurants and the delicious Tartine bakery :)
7404181,42568013,2015-08-14,38784704,Francois,Le logement est très bien situé avec possibilité de garer dans un parking privé. Il est très bien équipé y compris pour faire la cuisine et surtout très agréable spacieux et agencé avec gout. Surtout Shakina et Naveen sont très disponibles et très arrangeants. Ils répondent tout de suite aux questions et font tout pour rendre le séjour agréable. En dépit du prix élevé ce logement est à recommander surtout pour les familles ou pour 3 couples.
561602,156483704,2017-05-30,131474902,Kent,The best parts of this house are the view private space upstairs and a very helpful host. Sharing a bathroom and living space with the host seemed like it might be a problem but was really a non issue. We used BART a lot and didn't mind the 12 minute walk. Uber also made it very convenient to get around. We ended up eating at a number of the local restaurants and they were all good. I highly recommend this place. 
29241815,486511359,2019-07-12,12936376,Núria,La casa tiene todo lo que se puede necesitar. El tramvía que lleva al centro de SF está a 1 minuto andando.

We would stay in this place again.
Thanks Emily!"
11100926,207690130,2017-10-29,5036005,Juliane,"We stayed 5 days at Yael's apparment and liked it a lot.
The rooms have been spacious very clean and the bed was comfortable to sleep in.
Even though it is not in the city center the way to get there was good and quick. You have 3 bus lines just at the end of the street that lead you directly in the city center and Mission s just 15 min. to walk.
We enjoyed our stay a lot and Yael was a great host - even worried if we arrived savely because we didn't say hi right away
@Yael: thanks for taking care and making sure we are alright."

10227655,158442695,2017-06-06,132471877,Alexis,"We had an absolute perfect time with our two young girls. Tim and Thalia were incredibly generous of their time making sure we’d feel at home in the flat and around San Francisco and very generous period with small touches throughout our stay including a memorable gift for the girls to bring back home. We cannot say enough how great of a time we had how welcome we felt the spacious apartment was ideal for a family and we discovered an area of San Francisco that we did not know the Richmond District which is a great quiet family friendly area as well as a great base to visit all of San Francisco and to start day trips to the North and to the South.

Highly recommended!"
19328446,267495097,2018-05-21,8056685,Nancy,From the booking to the insights on where to go at night to the luxury sheets to the location Susan's place has it ALL!  Don't even think twice about booking you will find none better for the price!  I personally can't wait to come back!
11225011,245317492,2018-03-21,61323364,Sherry,Michelle was super helpful accommodating and responsive. She kept her place super neat clean and organized. She prepared a booklet which had basically everything you could ever need when travel in SF as well as information in her place. I would recommend Michelle’s Airbnb to anyone and would definitely come back again in the future!

1281167,12795741,2014-05-11,14733426,John,Dana was concise amd gave me exactly what we agreed upon. The room was spacious clean and in the heart of SF as requested.  Couldn't aak for more.
10968239,132900616,2017-02-19,70722861,Sammi,"This is a no frills kind of place located in a nice neighborhood with easy access to transportation.   The host Kathy was very easy to work with and was very responsive which my friend and I really appreciated.

However if you're looking for a place with your own bathroom and am taller than 5'4 then I would not suggest this room.  The bathroom in this room is tiny and oddly situated.  The toilet is tucked away in a low clearance ceiling inside the same shower area.  My friend and I both bumped our heads multiple times.  There is a nicer common bathroom that maybe used otherwise.  Also note the walls are extremely thin.  We were able to hear the host's entire conversation when she was on the phone one day as well as footsteps and commotion at 1am.  

Otherwise to be fair this was a decent stay and would recommend for its convenience.

21219237,492969616,2019-07-21,85306138,Melissa,This place perfectly met the traveling needs of my husband and I. Check in wasn’t until 4 but Grace allowed us to drop off our luggage in the garage so that we could do some sight seeing without lugging it around. The room was neat and clean and the bed was comfortable. The location was amazing and was only 2 blocks away from a bus stop the BART and some great food places/coffee shops. We couldn’t find the wi-fi password so I emailed Grace to see what it was (expecting to hear back in an hour or so) not 2 minutes later she e-mailed me back with the password. We immensely enjoyed our stay in San Francisco and would definitely stay with Grace again in the future. Thanks so much for a great week!

3759368,159831342,2017-06-11,56209023,Yidian,This house is not a independent loft. It's separated by a carpet at the stairs to the second floor. And you have to get through a narrow hallway which is not that clean to go into the loft. Leo was very nice. I didn't have a chance to finish my trip in SF. He agrees to return one day's cost to me. He is super nice. 
8763407,177440008,2017-08-02,84173748,Terell,It’s amazing place. Zain and Duncan are incredibly nice. Roux is so cute and amazing pooch. It’s a perfect place for solo travelers trying to meet new people.
442397,20835811,2014-10-06,413228,Barbara And Drew,Marianne is a host who thinks of everything and goes that extra mile to make her guests stay as comfortable as possible.  My husband his parents and I all spent a wonderful long weekend at Ocean beach and we all were delighted with the place.  We particularly found the provisions helpful as it meant we were able to spend more time enjoying San Francisco without lots of grocery trips.   Great location safe and friendly  generally quite peaceful hearing the fog horns in the morning mist was very poignant. 
150848,82475318,2016-06-27,28811350,Michael,Nancy was an amazing hostess. She went out of her way to answer all of our questions. She has a beautiful home and garden and made us feel right at home. Very clean and comfortable. It's a great neighborhood close to public transport and an abundance of great restaurants. The breakfast was very tasty and she makes great coffee. It was our first Airbnb experience and we are grateful to have shared it with Nancy. We would recommend her urban haven to everyone.

We had a minor problem on our first night and as soon as we let her know she can home immediately and fixed it straight away. We had an amazing time in San Francisco and would definitely stay with her again if we were to come back. 

Thanks

2049955,23149627,2014-11-24,332656,Madeleine,We had a fantastic stay at David and Kim's. They were awesome hosts and made everything super easy. We travelled with our 14 month old and Kim and David went out of their way to provide us with toys a high chair and crib (yay! one less thing to carry!). The apartment was awesome - modern and clean - and we loved the location! We visited GG park everyday because it was within walking distance. We would absolutely stay there again and recommend it to everyone. 
26111196,313093012,2018-08-24,55563858,Ana,I recommend Adrian's house. The area is nice and transportation is easy. Be ready to take teo buses or a bus and the BART to go downtown or move around.

The place is nice clean and very functional. It's located in a lively neighborhood with cafes restaurants and shops (and few tourists). The situation is also ideal to visit the city by foot or bus.
We haven't met Michael but he made everything very easy. His recommendations of places around were much appreciated!

Good location in a beautiful neighborhood in Castro. The bus stop right around the corner is perfect. Amanda was very helpful with our departure we could leave our bags there until it was time to leave for the airport. 

We would stay here again and enjoyed our time thanks Amanda!"

5548977,110199943,2016-10-24,1208422,Chelsea,Amazing property and great hosts! Todd was very responsive helpful and extremely nice -- he was proactive in asking if we needed any specialty items and left a great bottle of Prosecco to celebrate my birthday! The location was a little outside of the city (about a 20-30 min bus ride or $30 Uber/Lyft) but it was a beautiful local. Right across from Lands End trail and even has a little outdoor space. SUPER clean and well-decorated. Five of us fit comfortably. Highly recommended!
21070256,438881885,2019-04-17,152997840,Dave,We really enjoyed Bob's place.  Very convenient to Muni and restaurants/shops on W Portal.  As Bob's Mom suggested we did breakfast at Toast one day and it was excellent.  Beautiful quiet residential neighborhood.  The round about on Santa Ana even has a fountain.  A quick hop to Mt. Davidson and Twin Peaks.  Very comfortable place adjacent sun room a real treat.  Comfortable bed.  Parking in Bob's driveway in the alley in back worked fine.  Not for anyone with mobility issues as room is on second floor with a somewhat narrow stairway up.
20933318,401148894,2019-01-13,30963071,Paula,“Annie’s Cottage” is a gem of a property nestled in a safe/quiet neighborhood in SF. Unexpected delights included a super plush & comfy king sized bed a fancy (Nespresso) coffee machine w/milk frother and a little dog named “Bentley”!  The property is tucked in with access through a very quaint/centralized garden.  It was perfect for my extended weekend stay in SF!

I was visiting for work and wouldn't select this location again due to the lack of noise privacy (thin walls) and due to the sharing of the single bathroom among the three people (myself included) in the house - of 
32789669,552923242,2019-10-22,49126074,Jean,Great artsy studio. We enjoyed our stay and felt very safe. The unit is small but was comfortable for our needs. Renters need to know the bathroom/kitchen basically occupy the same room. This was not an issue for us. Beth is hugely accommodating and helpful. We appreciated the amazing sushi and Italian restaurant suggestions just a block or two away. The 24 bus stop is just up the street providing reasonable access to SF sites.
10469182,81226205,2016-06-21,58166540,Joanna,The little garden studio was perfect! Landy had a lovely note along with wine and snacks waiting for us. The fridge stocked with drinks and snacks was also great after we had been traveling all day. Great location walking distance to Lands End where we hiked the trails and had a lovely brunch at The Cliff House

Les alentours donnent accès au réseau des bus Muni qui permettent de se rendre où l'on souhaite dans San Francisco.
Un supermarché est présent à deux blocs et permet de faire ses courses à pieds.
Excellent logement et proprietaire extrêment sympathique qui n'a pas hésité à nous faire découvrir sa magnifique collection d'art."

They are magicians in the kitchen and I am so grateful for everything they were willing to do for me.  They have a vast selections of natural honeys and make their own alcohol all of which is to die for.  They made me feel so welcome which was great especially as I was travelling alone.  They are very engaging and eager to know a lot about what you are up to and they even got me involved in their own social activities in the city.

I really could not recommend them more!"

It’s impeccably clean well-stocked and with gorgeous views of San Francisco’s Mission district and Twin Peaks in the horizon. The property is spacious and comes with all essential necessities.

17794830,164559593,2017-06-28,99006146,Meg,"Cheap room in a inter-city location.

Be aware:
This is a hostel with private rooms.
The photos do not accurately depict the actual room you will be renting (the picture of the room we rented had a sink and mirror our room had no sink no mirror and shared and adjoining door with another room). I would call ahead and get the PRECISE amenities your room will have before you book.

I also messaged ""Herbert"" twice asking about room specifics and never got a response. Best bet is to look up the Herbert Hotel online and call the sweet front desk staff (they were fantastic).

Staff was friendly and helpful check in and out was easy."
8048653,58369386,2016-01-02,35782305,Paula Andrea,Eric was very responsive! Every time I had a question or concern he was available to answer questions. He even lent us his olive oil upon request! The only thing I would recommend is access to extra toilet paper or paper towels if needed and non-used shower bar soap. Everything else was wonderful! Thank you guys!! I would def stay there again. 
32702921,546509036,2019-10-13,288528014,Derick,Sabrina’s place was awesome! Away from the city just enough but close enough for the easy accessibility to the different parts of town. Sabrina was very accommodating when it came to checking our bags because of our early flight and storing them for our late departure. The space was very clean and welcoming. Sabrina unexpectedly provided us with water and snacks throughout the stay which was very nice for us always being on the go. Thanks again and we can’t wait to visit again!
4387067,243378516,2018-03-15,14916949,Kevin,This place is amazing huge bed and a wonderful modern bathroom. There is a supermarket and a Starbucks next to the house. There is also a Whole Foods on california street.
10971773,170476919,2017-07-15,72035876,Leeane,Friendly welcoming and helpful hosts. A beautiful house that is soo comfortable it was hard to leave. Handy to shops and fantastic public transport that made it quick and cheap to get around. Highly recommended. 
3416013,236904838,2018-02-20,74353148,Ryan,Emily’s house was our own. That’s the ultimate Airbnb experience. We were comfortable had what we needed and were safe and happy. Don’t hesitate to book a room in her home.

14153586,101683003,2016-09-14,18091871,Sarrah,Monica is a kind and gracious host and has prepared the apartment for any guest to have a comfortable stay. The location offers a great mix of access to nature (Golden Gate Park Land's End the Presidio) and proximity to bustling city activity in the Richmond and elsewhere. I would recommend Monica's home to future visitors to San Francisco. 
5853587,422726451,2019-03-11,153584115,Suresh,It was great staying with Rick. Nice guy. Really recommend it. Felt like home.
4526608,76617870,2016-05-28,15053173,Orlando,It's a cute little spot in a quiet neighbourhood with nice retro furniture. Tex and Chris are well-prepared accommodating hosts. Thanks!
945748,219145490,2017-12-16,32898378,Stacey,Good location clean & cosy small apartment.  Nice space to stay if you are a local visitor on mini vacation hoping to visit SF and avoid the commute for a few days (that's what we did).  Host offers good tips on cuisine - bakery across st great Burmese food in area.  Thefe is a fenced in bsck yard for dogs (watch where you step the families sharing this yard don't clean up their dog poop).  Host communication about check in was lacking and late (I think she thought we weren't coming but never checked with us to confirm).  I needed to contact  airbnb due to host was not responsive to call or messages (messages in airbnb several hours old).  Area parking exists but is tight and there is a parking garage about a mile away that has overnight parking.  Overall not my favorite airbnb experience but the apartment was really beautifully decorated and comfortable.
137546,294981721,2018-07-22,57404095,Zoe,Christopher’s place was absolutely amazing. It was in a very cool neighborhood that allowed us to see more of the city. Christopher’s suggestions for restaurants coffee shops and things to do we’re all AMAZING. The check i’m was super easy. The bed and sheets are incredibly comfortable and the bathroom is super clean. This is a perfect place to stay in SF 10/10 would definitely recommend to anyone! 
4097700,401200865,2019-01-13,80804204,Andrew,The suite in Caroline's house has everything you need for a trip to San Francisco. The check-in and communication with Caroline was easy and friendly and the location of her place right next to the Presidio is fantastic. Can certainly recommend staying here!
14404663,366522961,2019-01-02,231806417,Fabian,Very basic nothing extraordinary
9346930,348140126,2018-11-12,166667607,PattiJo,Be aware of people upstairs and a lot noise and thumping from that. Great location for tourist attractions in San Francisco. Very small bathroom for more than 2 people.
654279,146358454,2017-04-22,21076958,Matthew,Chris and Tim were fantastic hosts and made us feel at home from the outset. They offered great advice for sight-seeing restaurants and local events and we enjoyed getting to know them both as well as their neighbours and friends. Their home is beautifully decorated comfy and modern with great views of the water in a quiet neighbourhood. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend their home to other travellers and would definitely stay with Chris and Tim again. Thank you so much for making our visit to San Fran so enjoyable!
269371,43135159,2015-08-17,23833355,Chelsea,Bed is incredibly comfortable and neighborhood is quiet.  Matthew is an extremely courteous host and made us feel comfortable and at home.  There is a hike up the hill but we enjoyed the exercise.  Lots of safe parking if you rent a car.  Loved the energy of the Castro (street musicians farmers' markets always something going on and a very positive atmosphere).  Close to downtown and public transit.
12212013,134728989,2017-02-28,1629161,Saumaya,"I stayed at Jason's airbnb for almost a month while I was apartment hunting in SF. 

The airbnb was spotless all the amenities that you need for a temporary home are there and the location is amazing - this close to amazing cafes restaurants everything else in the city. 

Jason was extremely responsive whenever I had questions. Highly recommend this airbnb. "
1484792,116106796,2016-11-27,3012822,Janet,Cozy neighborhood apartment.  A large variety of restaurants are within three square blocks.  Neighborhood boutique shops are very good.  Mario is a wonderful host.  He had breakfast food in the refrigerator for us!  The bed and pull out are very comfortable.  We hope to rent again from Mario.  
3240016,23713112,2014-12-08,6695624,Ashley,This is a really lovely little place in a central location. Sandy was also very accommodating with my schedule/bags. 
11939561,171789049,2017-07-18,74371857,Angela,Tiffany and her place are absolutely fantastic! Tiffany is super friendly and a great communicator! Check in and out were super easy! The apartment it self was adorable and very cozy. Finishes were very well done and it is decorated very nicely. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! It is also so close to the BART station which makes getting around the city very easy!
109883,7944603,2013-10-09,7933040,Jordi,Great location to visit SF. No problem to get to the house and entering the apartment. Very nice and safe area easy parking on the street easy access to public transportation to go downtown. Clean apartment. Joan and Adam are great hosts.
11659435,68567408,2016-04-05,32759937,Taino,Loren was super kind easy to contact and knew a lot about the City. We had a great time visiting San Fransisco. The house is very easy to find and is quick access from highway 101. There were plenty of parking available so we rented a car the last two days and never had trouble finding a parking spot.  The house is very close to the Mission district and SOM plus there is a Whole Foods just down the street. The house had 2 rooms one of the rooms had a queen bed and the other had 2 twin beds. The shower was nice and always had hot water. Overall nice place to stay good location with a awesome host!
6688004,125053023,2017-01-03,101770480,Lei,Linda's place is wonderful. It is almost on the top of Bernal High so you can see the whole view of SF. The house is beautiful with a small garden. And Linda probably the coolest host I ever met. She traveled a lot and care about people so she can always provide so many advice about traveling and life. Highly recommended!
6505426,157850996,2017-06-04,116288878,Heidi,We loved staying here! The location is great! Right in between Noe valley and the Castro which was perfect! Plus Huib was so sweet. And we loved all of his art work. It was clean comfortable and charming. We would stay here again!

4962043,28025499,2015-03-16,28138210,Elizabeth,Brendan was an excellent host!  He was super flexible with our arrival/check-out times and was helpful with estimating accurate travel time estimates to SFO.  His place is super convenient to get to from the airport too - just FYI.   The room is lovely clean and super comfortable!  Thanks Brendan! 
30797856,441281513,2019-04-21,248811687,Erik,La zona es tranquila y segura por lo que puedes dejar tu carro afuera sin problemas. Ten en cuenta que debes llegar temprano para conseguir puestos cercanos y no dejar el carro tan alejado.! El ingreso al apartamento es seguro y rápido. Por encontrarse en un tercer piso no estaría tan apto para niños pequeños y personas de tercera edad.! El espacio interno del apartamento permite llegar y descansar con comodidad pero ten en cuenta que es pequeño.! Recomendamos el lugar si tú pienso es dormir seguro y tranquilo y conocer San Francisco.! Cerca tienes Lugares para comer cercanos y lugares turísticos cercanos.! Rentamos un vehículo y fue la mejor opción para movernos en San Francisco para así no perder tiempo y disfrutar de nuestra estadía.!
10379560,447491053,2019-05-03,206110866,Dominique,"Wow is all I can say! An amazing place to stay!
Right near the beach and a public transport and walking distance so some great eateries.
This room was amazing; the bed the fabulous private bathroom the view of back yard the private seperated entrance! I would say this was better than a hotel room!
Felicia was amazing and so quick to reply to questions. Communication was above and beyond.
The room was decorated wonderfully and Felicia is a superb host! Loved this place!!!!"
17285258,346726754,2018-11-09,16473153,Shamari,Had an amazing time at time at Tania’s. It was an easy check in and great location. All the amenities were great and everything was labeled so it was easy to navigate. Great stay!!!!!
3182798,103456653,2016-09-22,14371905,Jag,Location location location ... it was great fun staying on Ed's boat and we could not have wished for a better base for our 3 nights in San Francisco.  Ed was very helpful and we had a brilliant time.
3122882,536970459,2019-09-27,97545974,Sudha,"Absolutely amazing  and approachable people and Tucker.  Very much felt like we were at home and the lovely touches as in the treats. Tucker was adorable  he loved to show his affection by licking you and he thinks you there to see him. Considering this was my 1st experience with Tucker he has given me the confidence to consider other Air B&B hosts. Easy to  get to places.
Anyone looking  at this you will not regret your stay!!"
14745298,163373256,2017-06-24,18843026,Roger,Naomi's studio was perfectly suited for my wife  and I and our 16-year-old son. The neighborhood was fantastic and we ended up dining out three nights in a row in the  'hood based on Yelp searches. We loved Uma Casa (Portuguese) Lupa (Italian) and Eric's Restaurant (Chinese). Naomi's apartment was spotless and the deck was great for hanging with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine and taking in the SF skyline - be it engulfed in morning fog or evening darkness. Naomi was very responsive to our needs - explaining how to open the futon or giving restaurant tips. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks! Roger
25634749,436734352,2019-04-13,157886577,Milja,A very pleasant stay. Everything was perfect.
128230,8293471,2013-10-24,7155166,Tanguy,This place is really a sanctuary... at Castro. All that's said in the description is perfectly accurate. It's really a great place. From the first night I felt like home ... (And thanks again to Maria for having expected me until 2am). It is a place decorated with taste and simplicity. You find here all the comfort to spend a great time. It's quiet but near a busy place where you can find everything... at a walking distance. You can have an access to a little pretty garden and  If you have a car... you have an access to a garage. This is the ideal place for a single person or a couple. I will definitely return !
1043282,33647388,2015-05-31,26777665,Sean,John is an absolute scholar and gentleman the perfect host. His house is situated in the very trendy district of Castro and is idealy situated. His house is more akin to a 5 star motel adorned with beautiful antiques and exquisite art work. His communication was perfect abd thoughtful right down to asking if we enjoy coffee and would like to wake up to a fresh pot.  When we woke up after a long sleep in a cloud like bed we were greeted with freshly baked goods and the mist delicious banana bread. I seriously have no complaints John is a legend his demeanor is on point and his house and the overall experience was one of luxury.
5547500,97826040,2016-08-28,3648301,David,"Jason and Ryan are wonderful hosts and I really enjoyed my stay with them in San Francisco. 

Their place has one of the most amazing views of San Francisco I have ever seen. The location is perfect walking distance to the Castro parks bus on the door step great food close by - everything you need to make the most of this wonderful city.

Apart from the amazing view the place was very comfortable to stay in and Jason and Ryan are a fountain of information on the local area. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to experience San Francisco - beats staying at a hotel!"
7421008,159294447,2017-06-10,84293240,Samuel,Viajamos en Familia Muy Comoda Tranquila y Excelente Ubicación. Totalmente Equipado. Si van en vehículo tener presente que se debe estacionar en la calle. Muy Recomendable!.
12741695,179485144,2017-08-07,111319324,Hilary,We loved our stay in David's apartment. He was a great host - very welcoming and laid back (he didn't mind when my daughter followed his adorable dog Desmo upstairs when I was unpacking). The location was great - in a really safe area with plenty of free parking only a few blocks from the beach and Golden Gate Park but a quick and easy streetcar ride into the city. The apartment is beautifully designed and decorated with lots of details that made our stay even more enjoyable e.g. fresh flowers super soft bedding and an Amazon Echo that meant we could play almost any kind of music. We cooked quite a bit and had everything we needed; the hob and oven were really good quality so made it all very easy. We would love to stay here again!
8275596,68449451,2016-04-05,61000831,Jonah,Rebecca and Seth are great hosts! They are warm and open and made me feel welcome in their home. The first night they even waited up with me for the airport to deliver my luggage! (They’re also super chill and know how to give someone their space.) Plus their dog Lola is just the sweetest. The apartment is quite nice and the 2-level porch/balcony and yard area is really beautiful and well-decorated with a stunning view. The place is clean and homey. The neighborhood was cute and residential; though it was a few (hilly) blocks to the nearest stores Rebecca and Seth were super-helpful with making sure I got where I needed to go and knew what I needed to know. I really appreciated that. Overall I would definitely recommend staying with them!
3775090,32498502,2015-05-19,27119546,Allison,Molly's apartment was a perfect home away from home! I literally felt like I was stepping into my own apartment. She made our stay super easy and the location is so close to the water views of the Golden Gate and right near lots of fun spots to eat drink and shop! Molly left details for everything down to how to work the espresso maker. She also left lots of recommendations for us to check out in the area. My boyfriend and I loved her place and thought she was great host. 
455783,116565306,2016-12-01,10947239,Michael,Matthew and everyone were super welcoming and professional - Everything was totally seamless.  Highly recommended!
166199,206902236,2017-10-27,4000287,Manuela,"It is a beautiful well located cottage. The kitchen is very well equipped and you get a spacious bathroom.
Great amenities good WiFi and clean!
Loved the neighborhood!"
8907289,182904969,2017-08-15,79218303,Anita,Lindy's place was funky clean and relaxing. The room is directly above the bike shop so if you like long sleep-ins it might not be right for you but ear plugs are provided. Plus in a city like SF with so much to see why would you want to sleep in?!
29062428,528787559,2019-09-13,125583360,Cassidy,"Traci and Nathan were excellent hosts. The space was so tidy and cute! They were quick to respond to all questions and they offered help if my guest and I wanted some local suggestions! The amenities provided were perfect for our needs and we were grateful to unwind in a cozy bed with some Netflix on their Apple TV after long days of sight seeing. I will definitely try to stay here the next time I’m in San Francisco. Thank you for adding to a wonderful trip!

P.s This was by far the most relaxing check in/check out process of any other Air BnB I’ve ever stayed in!"
16831471,542425676,2019-10-06,34026495,Lanna,Helen和Jojo特别热情好客房间也特别的美式非常舒适空间很大还有一个很棒的花园体验非常好｡
516836,8052513,2013-10-14,8057050,Dan,This AirBnB experience will be tough to follow. Not only is Fran's home beautiful (with amazing views of the city) but her welcoming and friendly personality was by far the best part of my stay.
7923146,205813507,2017-10-22,25243948,Kimberly,The house is lovely well stocked in a great location and has an amazing view.  We had a great time!
109883,49116533,2015-10-01,7888076,Ravi,Joan was present to both receive us and see us off. The apartment was a little far from the nearest restaurants  provision stores and the Muni station. This necessitated a fair amount of walking.
191632,7291976,2013-09-14,3744632,Chris,"Great hosts. They were helpful and let me store my rented bike in the garage. 

The place is quiet simple and neat. Ideal if you're going to be out and about all day anyway. Perfect location: near the park great bus access and right off of the famous 'Wiggle' bike route which is an easy ride back up the hill from Market Street. "
16933274,285088448,2018-07-02,26531772,Katri,We started our California-roadtrip at Igor’s place - we stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay. It was nicely located with several possibilities for a breakfast or a dinner. Igor was a generous host and the check-in and -out were easy. Igor answered all our questions really quickly online as well. I would recommend to consider Igor’s home for a wonderful stay in San Francisco! Besides the nice apartment the San Francisco city was amazing!
3664261,79996726,2016-06-15,3478828,Arthur,Max's place is awesome. Really well situated for getting to see the city in all directions. We really enjoyed staying here and recommend to all!
18669935,211688262,2017-11-13,11217873,Joanne,"Sarah and Mischelle’s home was a home away from home exuding warmth and cosy charm. The bed and pillows were very comfortable the kitchen was extremely well-outfitted and the home technology from wifi to Netflix was both extensive and reliable! 

Communication with Sarah was always easy with texts being answered very quickly facilitating the check in process. The condo was exactly as it appears in the photos and very clean and well maintained. We highly recommend staying at Sarah and Mischelle’s condo!"
38129278,556497314,2019-10-29,214235868,Ksenia,"Had a great stay.
This is a small unit designed for people on short [business] trips: there is a small closet with a few shelves an iron instant coffee and a bathroom with a necessary minimum of stuff. Great value.
Couple of things: the ceiling is quite low so if you are very tall  - be prepared. Also the one window looks our into the hosts’ backyard which doesn’t seem to pose an issue but is worth knowing."
5154367,450210373,2019-05-08,8302386,Regina,"We were uncontactable a few days prior to check in and arrived late. Dayne made arrangements so that we could have a smooth check -in even though I had had no access to the check-in procedures he sent me. I was extremely grateful for that. 
He was extremely helpful with laundry and local tips. 
All in all  it was excellent except for the minor inconvienence of  having to observe  v stringent parking rules . (Like elsewhere with slope in SF I  suppose....)"
3384413,435504996,2019-04-10,113845718,Judy,Great modern very clean home in the heart of the Mission- close to excellent restaurants and easy to get around SF.  Sarah very quick to respond and assist.

8524982,127054729,2017-01-15,25759852,Ana,Shane's place is perfect for touring around San Francisco. The room has its own private entrance so it feels like a small studio all for yourself. 100% recommended 
4902729,144901830,2017-04-16,125158871,Yomaira,The room was clean a little small if you trouble with more than one person. Overral it was a pleasant experience 
958,220443,2011-04-08,426888,Michelle,"Great place to stay.  I would highly recommend it!  Superb location -- half a block to Muni and 10 minute ride to downtown.  Holly is so nice and very helpful too.
Two things you may want to know:
A landline is supplied for free domestic (US) calls in case your cell phone does not get a signal here (notorious for AT&T users in Duboce Park).
You will hear footsteps from the little one on the floor above when he wakes up around 8 am!"
9196933,432367487,2019-04-03,48094647,Alexandra,Deb & Jim are so wonderful hosts! Their home is really good located and has a very beautiful quite and safe neighbourhood. Jim gave us a lot of sightseeing tipps and the welcome and check in was perfect (we could also store our lagguage there before check in - thank you!). The apartment ist really nice and cosy - the bed and the pillows so comfortable and the jacuzzi the perfect finale after a long walking day through beautiful san fransisco! Thank you for 3 wonderful days!
774323,123791765,2016-12-30,8963756,Jessica,Jan made us feel very welcome in her lovely home. The room was spacious and had everything we needed and the location was fantastic - perfect for exploring the Mission district and San Francisco. We really enjoyed chatting with Jan who gave us great tips for our stay and road trip to Big Sur. Jan's cat Thriller was a lovely bonus! 
1286943,511697798,2019-08-17,257458741,William,This is a great home in a great area perfect for a family vacation. My friends and I spent a lovely week here.

15769324,151032786,2017-05-10,116598812,Micaela,The staff was friendly but there were no sinks or soap in the bathrooms on floors 3 & 4. If you don't use Airbnb you pay more but you get a bathroom connected to your room.
29661822,544694905,2019-10-10,6454455,Jean-Philippe & Xuong,"Wonderful place with gorgeous decoration. The host is hyper friendly. The puppy is adorable.

9735841,218033730,2017-12-10,9222498,Zinnia,Olivier' s place is fantastic. It has everything that you need for a nice stay in San Francisco. We stayed for 5 days with our two little children and we really felt like home. Everything is absolutely accurate described and Olivier is always available for anything you need. The apartment is really child-friendly with crib children books and even toys. Parking space at the door is really convenient. Very good choice if you want to stay in San Francisco. Thank you Olivier!
14029901,158238571,2017-06-05,51922793,Carlos,Lance and Nil are amazing hosts! They made us feels like we were home the entire time. Also Balance (the wonder dog) is the most adorable pet - she loves being pet. 
4948340,337876172,2018-10-17,20331932,Daniel,I was really happy with the memory foam bed.
585326,464909876,2019-06-06,112588418,Andrea,The Cozy Suite is delightful. Everything you need and super clean and cute. The garden outside the window is lovely. Su left some chocolate for each of us; there was plenty of coffee to start the day and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Enjoyed our stay!

13774014,213070390,2017-11-19,13932422,Kevin,Lauren's space is really great. We loved the decor and organization of everything. Free parking in an SF neighborhood is a huge plus. Would love to stay again!
35263886,560113129,2019-11-05,289536409,Rock Candie Designs,This place was crazy clean the pack-n-play was perfect and the house is so close to the beach! Steve was great with sending suggestions and answering my messages asking for suggestions really quickly! Also the house is equipped with every kitchen tool you’d need and shampoo conditioner and body wash. Such a great place! We loved the added touch of Hershey’s kisses too. Tip: WiFi signal is non-existent anywhere but the bathroom.
12930338,296819816,2018-07-26,201686018,Amanda,It was very clean with a 70’s ambience. The hosts were very kind.
9067632,250959300,2018-04-06,14093875,Elsa,I had a fantastic experience staying with Amy Jeff and Cashmere. I was busy working but the space was very comfortable check in was easy and everyone was super friendly and helpful. The setting is beautiful and the spot is very well located. I’d love to come back next time i’m in town!

216064,299741107,2018-07-31,184713467,Nick,I came to France for the first time without much knowledge of what I am looking at as I wander from place to place and I am super grateful for finding this tour with Ben. It was everything I was hoping it would be I learned so much about the French revolution and Paris in general along with the historical stuff Ben ends the tour in a great part of town that I wouldn't have ventured to on my own so if you are interested in a thorough historical adventure through time I would take the tour. There's quite a bit of walking which I love so be prepared and if the sun is out on a summer day bring a hat and a bottle of water. Even though our tour started at 6pm the sun was quite hot still. Thanks Ben for the excellent dinner suggestion at the end. 
22586319,339630817,2018-10-21,100315719,Valentin,Logement très propre et bien situé pour les transports en commun à San Francisco. Il manque néanmoins de quoi cuisiner vraiment (four plaques) et le bruit des autres logement peut gêner.
24149977,486466692,2019-07-12,266741114,Mark,I recommend Cindy's place to anyone
14422371,571099928,2019-11-30,245908423,Hao,Quick response to our questions. Nice stay for the price.
4227441,315386951,2018-08-28,28722241,Raquel,We had a great stay at Maria's house. We didn’t meet but she was willing to help whatever we needed. The location is perfect the room and bathroom are large and comfortable nothing missing! I definatelly recomend stayng in Maria’s home!
33942157,503362372,2019-08-05,2607593,Jesse,Such a great spot with lots of charm and history.
2169208,15282672,2014-07-06,4815205,Polina,Pierre's little bungalow is quite perfect. It is very conveniently located within the city with a bus taking under 30 minutes to get to Ghirardelli Square etc (just 10 minutes to all the great spots by car). The apartment itself is roomy clean and very well furnished. We loved the kitchen and all the great cooking utensils! Pierre was very welcoming and shared with us some great recommendations for restaurants and local events. He was always available and was very flexible with our arrival and departure times as we came by via road trip. Would love to stay here again next time!
7342996,305033202,2018-08-10,203611747,Sara,"Pensé en dejar este comentario en inglés pero quiero estar segura de usar las palabras correctas. 

Era mi primer viaje sola y mi primera  en USA y tenía muchos miedo. Mi estancia no pudo ser mejor. Nunca creí que iba a conocer a dos personas tan lindas como Jack y Cristina. Fueron super atentos afectuosos contenedores me cuidaron en todo. 

Su casa es hermosa la cama super cómoda las instalaciones a nivel limpieza buen gusto espacio y comodidad fueron insuperables. 

Lo recomiendo a todos no solo van a hospedarse en un lugar espectacular sino que también van a conocer a dos personas maravillosas. 

Volvería mil veces gracias Jack y Cristina"
2088622,32703197,2015-05-20,31469290,Christopher,Kenix was a fantastic host. Kenix was very warm and inviting into her home upon arriving and provided us with everything we needed for our stay in San Fran. We had a very clean private and comfortable room in the downstairs part of her house. Her neighborhood was safe and it is easy to get to downtown using uber or taxi. Also she lives right near a neighborhood that has grocery stores and restaurants. I would happily use Kenix again for air bnb.
1056844,539182772,2019-09-30,181662504,Cesar,Chantal & Louie were super friendly and a pleasure to talk to. Great looking place and the bed was unbelievably comfortable! Thanks again

17421876,552916911,2019-10-22,134428250,Lillian,A great place to stay! Very clean very convenient.
28208579,488935165,2019-07-15,234319446,Victoria,Lovely place. Really convenient with the free parking. Close to nice restaurants and cafes.
8152867,64486679,2016-03-04,35494654,David,Carol was a wonderful host. The accommodations were better than described and she was quite gracious with her advice as well as patient with my questions. The location is perfect for exploring the city or the beach and close to public transport. 
27855141,512812957,2019-08-18,43196776,Angelina,This is the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Everything was perfect - the location the space the personal touches the communication.  I can’t recommend this place enough!
27555509,368973202,2019-01-08,31667519,Fernando,Reccomend it a 100% everything was perfect!
1944564,565719294,2019-11-17,676293,Jonathan,Amazing creative energy there is nothing like staying in the loft above the sculpture studio and chatting with Brian about art and having access to the Mission and nearby Protrero amenities and galleries.
59702,19941648,2014-09-21,19807449,Robert (Nathan),We had a great experience at Toby and Joe's cottage.  We enjoyed the privacy of the cottage and bathroom as well as our interactions with our hosts in the communal kitchen.  The garden setting is lovely the bed is very comfortable and the neighborhood quiet with easy parking on the street.  As we were on east coast time it was nice to have access to the kitchen at 5am for morning coffee.  Best part of the stay was getting to know our hosts both artists with impressive studios on the ground floor and interesting stories to tell.  This was such a better experience than a hotel!
10410858,102100399,2016-09-16,16761747,Katie,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9945149,168058514,2017-07-08,97527283,George,Nicely appointed apartment close to Presidio Park. Generally quiet although some noise from garage and road. We were visiting family who lived very close so location ideal for us! Good public transport links and local amenities. Poor mobile phone reception in apartment.
5394755,337585641,2018-10-16,124335548,Victoria,Great room and great location! Walking distance to restaurants the bart and Mission Dolores park. Absolutely perfect for one person looking to explore San Francisco. Had a great stay.  Thanks for everything!
4909117,98553812,2016-08-31,3696693,Jane,Loved San Francisco.  Room clean but lot of traffic (Email hidden by Airbnb) fy bed and clean linen but 'Deluxe' slightly misrepresentative. District on the seedy side but close to everything.  Great Thai restaurant right next door called Tycoon.  Do go to Brenda's Soul Food Cafe on Polk Street (3 blocks away) for great Creole food and easy vibe - breakfast a must.
9882716,67695332,2016-03-30,8226169,Olivia,Dear Donna and Robert are so great they are really kind nice thoughtful responsible and interesting people it's been great to know them and stay at there fancy place. The sweet place is more bigger than the pictures showed. It's wide bright and comfortable. There has everything we need just like a sweet home. The back yard is cute and cozy. The location is in a very good area which is near the hall of Justice many officers around feel safe. It's easy for us to walk or take public transportation to the center of the city. It's worth than the price also the experience here make me feel that more than words. 
2274353,104817343,2016-09-28,94181594,Mazal,We had a phenomenal experience :) it is a beautiful apartment! Instructions were to the T and easy to follow. Parking was super easy and less than a block away every time! Bed was very comfortable and the whole apartment was nice and clean. About 15 min from the airport either by Bart or car. About 25 min to embarcadero by car. Very cute neighborhood with good coffee and eats less than three blocks away. Couldn't have asked for more. Have already recommended to a friend who will be going to SF soon. Would certainly stay here myself the next time! 
4956697,45470416,2015-09-03,8434375,Daryn,Mike's place was in a great spot for us to grab transit downtown to the Mission district and a lovely walk to the Haight. We explored the neighbourhood a bit and found some incredible Vietnamese food and one of the best book stores I've ever been to. The apartment was a tad dark but it was clean and quaint and served our needs fine for the two nights we spent there. 
14990478,280672406,2018-06-23,129585002,Amanda,After being in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the busy city this cozy cottage was a welcome respite. It was exactly as represented; charming clean and welcoming. I can’t recommend this place enough.
2119773,423989825,2019-03-15,23423199,Omer,We loved staying here. A lovely place. The neighborhood is awesome and the recommendations were very helpful. A perfect getaway. Will come back here for sure
10347570,414148413,2019-02-18,38846583,Kelsey,Incredibly beautiful loft! Perfect location for sight seeing around the city. Vidhu had great suggestions of places to try and was a wonderful host.
20439767,327457607,2018-09-23,197856669,Renato,Es war alles in Ordnung
25919871,365828311,2019-01-01,165274074,Nicole,Vicky’s house was very clean and I loved the style of her place. Our stay was great!

3721927,140103595,2017-03-27,31266432,Brent And Christopher,Couldn't have asked for a better experience. The apartment itself is beautiful very clean and well appointed. Kelly was a fantastic host with great communication and was even quick to solve a very minor issue (cable remote batteries were dead). Will be happily returning for all future visits!
1620411,341386864,2018-10-26,2415270,John,I had a wonderful stay at Amitsa's studio. The apartment was clean spacious and had all the amenities one would need. The neighborhood is lovely and very traditionally San Francisco. Check in and departure were super easy and communication during the stay was great. Thank you!
2783251,70619047,2016-04-19,4910852,Anni,My fiancé & I LOVED staying at Ellen's garden apartment in San Fran. We were warmly greeted by Ellen when we arrived & everything was as the photos show. Beautiful garden courtyard which looks over Fishermans Wharf & enough space in the apartment to feel like a home away from home. I would recommend this place to anyone who visits San Fran. 5 min walk to Fisherman's Wharf and views of the Golden Gate Bridge only a short stroll away. Thanks Ellen we will be back. 
8276309,448997974,2019-05-05,1161329,Andrew,Beautiful apartment great hosts!
5849626,79255488,2016-06-12,1324823,Pat & Kat,Tiffany was a fantastic host. Very available to answer our questions and so accommodating. The location is perfect. Close to everything! Room was very clean spacious and the shower is great! I would certainly stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in the hipster part of San Fran
4287481,349503109,2018-11-17,224706061,Daan,Amazing cozy space not too far from the city and enough amenities nearby. Very friendly and helpful people can fully recommend!
12853235,312550093,2018-08-23,12167552,Gustavo,"My group of four had a nice time at Warren's place for two nights. It's in a great location and the unit had plenty of room for two couples. Checking in and out was easy and Warren was a thoughtful flexible and responsive host.

We enjoyed cooking in the well-stocked kitchen and hanging out in the front sitting room. The internet was reliable and fast enough for video calls and the dining room table is spacious if you need to work from your laptop.

As the listing description states this is not an Airbnb set up primarily for travelers- it is a home that is lived-in and full of the residents' possessions. If you need a lot of space to unpack or need everything hotel-level neat this might not be a good option for you.

But if you're looking for something roomy and unique in a well-situated quiet safe neighborhood I would highly recommend it!"
28189029,322647416,2018-09-13,204855950,Yulia,Vlad & Olga are great & wonderful hosts. Their home is lovely & located in my favorite area of SF~West Portal. Hiking in Stern Grove Golden Gate Park Touristy & local spots Ocean Beach can be easily accessed by Muni which is around the corner. Also the parking on-site made my trip so comfortable. The beds were very cozy & comfy with upscale linens & towels. Every morning - delicious coffee and continental breakfast were offered. It was the best as I didn’t want to cook on my vacation. Our stay was very peasant and we highly recommend it.
3168359,494140096,2019-07-23,242035916,Melissa,We stayed for 3 nights and found the home clean and comfortable; it’s a lovely peaceful location; perfect for our family of 3. Jamie had great communication and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Easy parking and access around San Fran via bus or Uber’s
22656065,285820177,2018-07-04,121860544,Azucena,"PLEASE do yourself a favor and do not stay here. I have never been inclined to write a review but my stay here was beyond dismal that it merits a review so that others do not make the same mistake I did. 

1. The agents are very unresponsive and never know anything. You will never be able to reach them on the phone. My roommate and I called their office several times both before and after booking but they picked up only after like the 10th call. When we finally reached them they were very unhelpful. 

2. Location is HORRIBLE. There were people harassing my roommate and I every time we stepped outside of our apartment people doing heroine/crack literally right by the front door and men with visible weapons. Beyond scary. I know that this is not something that Landmark can control but they should make this more clear to anyone looking into booking their place.

3. Non-functioning appliances.

4. The elevator rarely worked.

5. There were mice in the kitchen. Absolutely disgusting.

6. When we tried cancelling Adam one of the agents tried blackmailing us into not writing a bad review or else we would not get our cancellation money back even though we were entitled to it because we booked through airbnb. I quote: ""Termination of the lease penalty free is also contingent upon no negative reviews. Airbnb is aware of all of this."" 

I contacted Airbnb and they told me that they were not aware of this and encouraged me to write a review with my honest opinion.

In short if you want a pleasant stay in SF please DO NOT even consider Landmark."
8472927,243387750,2018-03-15,132227541,Jamie,Amazing place to stay. Very easy to get to public transit or uber/Lyft. Quiet area with a lovely view. Hosts are very hospitable and quick to communicate. Loved every minute of our stay here.
1920033,320396125,2018-09-08,114372859,Lucie,This accomodation is amazing! Kevin is so kind and nice accomodation was clean and prepared. Location is pretty close to city centre bus stop  right in front of the house. Kevin breakfast where you can have everything (fruit youghurt cereals eggs etc.). Highly reccomended! Lucy
11845487,458953916,2019-05-26,126103882,Kelsey,Cute little one bedroom apartment in a safe neighborhood (Sunset District) of San Fran. The sofa bed wasn’t the best but it was pretty standard for a sofa bed. Entrance was easy d/t the keypad on the door. The only frustration with this place was the daily 6am alarm clock of little feet running around upstairs. Pretty noisy. You are below the hosts home so this is something to take into consideration. Other than that it was a great place to stay.
17301015,227688084,2018-01-15,27116159,Penny,Very good!!!房东非常nice!会说中文~
17592480,312570465,2018-08-23,37219493,Nhi,"We had a very pleasant stay at Albert & Tiffany’s place. Tiffany was very friendly & helpful. 
Another plus point their bathroom is very clean & equipped with a modern Japanese toilet. "
4519780,476224748,2019-06-25,92668478,María,"This was my first time staying in a shared room and the experience was not bad at all I got to know awesome girls from other countries.

The staff is super cool they always had a smile and were very responsive and helpful with all my questions they helped me booked an awesome tour and gave recommendations. 

It was a really great experience I didn’t feel insecure and it was a plus that there was always a staff at the front desk to help."
24036000,492840555,2019-07-21,268774147,Michela,The place was fantastic. Very clean and stylish with everything you needed. In a great location and with a beautiful view on the city. I would definitely go back again!

17622881,357580300,2018-12-10,64112390,Andrew,Cozy clean and comfortable place to get a good night's rest.
14963288,159852027,2017-06-11,70537816,Anthony,Great location friendly staff. You'll be staying right in the heart of Union Square. 
15478431,202313389,2017-10-10,96296532,Christie,The location is fantastic and the combination of amenities on the boat and the dock were perfect for us. It was just a few minutes to all the business of Pier 39 but still a quiet place to rest and relax. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends.
8356380,152457820,2017-05-16,59461819,Susanne,Cheryl is a very care taking woman. I can highly recommend staying at her place and would come again. The apartment is clean spacy quiet and well equipped.
16362304,210920128,2017-11-11,148293434,Chris,Nice quiet private room next to Ocean beach Sutro baths Lands End and the Cliff House. Harris is a very gracious and helpful host. We had a wonderful second honeymoon here and would definitely come back.
4882295,564362713,2019-11-15,239924474,Donggyu,"good and clean accomomdation
nice hosts with good response.

location-wise is bit far from centre though"
21964157,467645421,2019-06-10,84147703,Rox,Exactly as described! Very friendly hosts
15236335,259831144,2018-05-02,178502278,Lucia,El lugar es muy lindo igual que las fotos. La cama super comoda. Muy bien equipado para desayunar o preparar una cena. Lo unico es que es muy difícil estacionar en la zona.
918341,188256452,2017-08-28,5806929,Nicholas,Staying at Kepa's is the gold standard for Airbnb experiences. She is a great person and keeps four very well furnished clean tidy and comfortable spaces surrounding a beautiful common garden area. I very much appreciate the friendship I have developed with her though my stays and the calm and comfortable atmosphere at her place. Thank you Kepa!
21425660,227867724,2018-01-16,164767173,Jiajun,Our host Clint and his family are very good and helpful to us. His house is safe and comfortable. Our trip became better because of Clint and his family. It’s still hard to find parking near where we live but it’s a common problem any where in San Francisco. If I travel to San Francisco next time I will stay with Clint and his family.
53934,170397,2011-01-14,172204,Bernard,Great stay at Megan and Manny's place.  GREAT location within walking distance of Union Square and a host of other attractions.  Megan is a wonderful well-traveled very helpful host with great recommendations.  Lots of privacy.  The room itself is on the second floor with windows facing over the street.  It can be a bit animated outside but it did not bother me a bit.  (This is San Francisco!)  Room is outfitted with a large desk chair hi-speed wireless internet connection and a VERY comfortable armchair.  The bed is a comfortable double-sized air mattress that blows itself automatically.  I flipped it on its side during the day to keep it out of the way.  The bathroom is nice and comfortable.  I did not use the kitchen or the roof-top terrace.  The area is also very safe.  I walked late at night and was never worried.  I'll be back on my next stay!
2315086,12691799,2014-05-08,9198508,Jochen,"Renee and Ron were delightful hosts - interested and interesting. We enjoyed staying three nights with them in their wonderful home. The bedroom is very nice and comfortable and faces to the quiet backyard. Our two year old really enjoyed the company of Quincy the dog!!!

The location in Pacific Heights is great to explore San Francisco - it is a quiet neighbourhood but close enough to get to downtown easily via public transport. For us it was a great advantage to be independent of our car which was nicely parked in the garage of the house!  We wouldn't hesitate to recommend Renee and Ron to others in the AirBnb community."
12511163,303130431,2018-08-06,153382580,Jessica,Quiet location and very comfortable beds. Super sweet and made us feel right at home
1442027,554096875,2019-10-25,91443490,Sion,Excellent stay.  The studio was really nice and the location was great.  Having the roof terrace and gym in the building were great features for a long stay.
545685,4605068,2013-05-14,1257603,Annalea,A nice quiet place to stay close to the Gold Gate Bridge park. I also love how you can check-in at anytime.
19050152,187870141,2017-08-27,136919747,Danni,Sandeep and Sammy are the most amazing hosts they are so welcoming and friendly nothing is too much for them and you can tell they really want you to have a good time while you are staying. The apartment is decorated to a high standard and the location is central so you can get everywhere easily regardless of your choice of transport. While I stayed I went on a few runs around the surrounding areas the neighbours were so friendly and always had time for you. I can't honestly say I couldn't have asked to stay anywhere better - thanks again guys and I will definitely be looking to stay with you again
1471683,109466008,2016-10-21,20529724,Laurie,The host made every effort to make me feel totally at home.   My accommodations were excellent.   The house is beautiful  and the neighborhood is fantastic with great restaurants  beautiful parks  and historic homes. 
631635,351133737,2018-11-21,29063109,John,What an amazing Victorian dark paneled wood sanctuary. Spacious and eclectically decorated the main parlor has great views of Twin Peaks The Castro and down Market Street to the Financial Center. This was a perfect apartment to feel like a local again for two weeks.
8474452,183997583,2017-08-18,17224297,Christopher,Renee and Andrew's place was perfect! Amazing location just a short uber/lyft to the Mission district and we also took the Bart downtown which was also super convenient. The little kitchen in the suite was really convenient as well as the parking they offered (for $20/day) in their garage since we were on a road trip. Thanks again for everything and helping make our visit to San Francisco amazing

29416324,415480125,2019-02-22,241437251,Michael,I was a little concerned about the shared bathroom before arriving. The other guests were good about cleanliness.  I stayed 5 nights and everything was very good. I'll definitely stay with Alice again in the future when I need to be in that part of SFO.
2134475,29874967,2015-04-13,30381195,Linda,"Sandor and his lovely wife Giuliana were the perfect hosts for our recent weekend stay at their home in the Marina district.  It was our first airbnb experience and they helped make our stay extra-enjoyable. Their house was cozy and inviting our bed super-comfy and there was plenty to do and see just a short walk away. Another great feature:  free parking on the street!  (You can see the Golden Gate Bridge at the end of the block.)

After a seven-hour drive Sandor greeted us with wine cheese and crackers. Throughout our two-night stay Sandor and Guiliana went the extra mile to make us feel welcome. They were delightful conversationalists and provided us with a tasty breakfast. Oh and they have the two most adorable dogs.  Highly recommended!

10099733,484423369,2019-07-08,85977105,Cathy,The location is super right on Union Square. The service is exceptional. There are refreshments in the lobby all of the time. The room was neat and clean and had everything we could wish for.
32216182,429343411,2019-03-27,2885267,Kevin,Hareg's place was great.  We wanted to book a place that could potentially sleep 4 in case my family made it into town and this place was the same price as most of the places in Bernal Heights that could only sleep two!  They did end up making it and though it's definitely not a huge room it worked great for a place to sleep and shower and wind down after a day of seeing the city.  it really had everything we needed and is in a great a scenic location.  It's definitely a hike up to most of the Bernal attractions if you arent used to it so if you want a lazy vacation you could consider springing for a spot a little more up the hill.  But for the money and considering the great hospitality I don't think you could find a better place than this.  We really loved it!
567239,89994313,2016-07-30,61680192,Seida,Absolutely fantastic! Very welcoming friendly and responsive!

We felt home right away and really enjoyed the neighborhood and nice cafés and restaurants which are just around the corner. Also Bernal Heights Park is just a 15 mins walk up the hill from where you have an awesome view of the city! Marty was very flexible with our arrival and made us feel home from the first day on with a lot of nice details such as fresh water and great coffee. Thanks Marty!

Ample street parking  super convenient location. Jeff and Donna was very good with communication they always check on us and made sure we were comfortable. Each room has queen size bed (like a real mattress not a pull out). There’s central AC which is really helpful especially when we needed the heater. Highly recommend everyone to stay with Jeff. We will most definitely request to stay here every time we visit. Better than staying in a hotel!!

Vi skulle endelig sige til hvis der var noget vi skulle have hjælp til eller noget vi manglede. Lejligheden var ren pæn og hyggelig med vores egen lille terrasse. Vi havde nøgle til vores egen indgang. Vi vil helt sikkert bo der igen og give vores bedste anbefalinger.

33578,6174043,2013-08-02,5346159,Steph,Amazingly Kepa's Garden Lookout is even more beautiful than the pictures show. We stayed there for 7 nights and had an absolutely incredible time -- it's a quiet and restorative place to stay -- perfect to come home to after a busy day of exploring San Francisco. The room itself is sunny clean comfortable and private. The location is awesome -- lots of little restaurants nearby and a short distance from downtown. I especially loved chatting with Kepa and learning about the history of her garden. She's awesome and was a fabulous first airbnb host! We'll definitely be back. 
4838843,56382192,2015-12-13,31314881,Nadav,We had such a wonderful time at Carly & Allie's beautiful home. It was absolutely stunning. They had decorated the place for the holidays and no detail was forgotten. We truly felt like we were at home. The place was immaculately clean - the beds were super comfortable and there were great bath amenities provided. The location was excellent - just a quick walk to the cute Marina shops and restaurants. We hope to return soon & make this our home away from home when visiting SF! Thank you so much C&A for such an unforgettable time in one of our favorite cities :-)

4464347,166192450,2017-07-02,94898877,Ashish,"If you love meeting new people this (Green Tortoise Hostel) is the place!!
Don't hesitate to book it thinking you have to share the room or anything. I have been to many hotels but never wrote a review. This place is so amazing that I wanted to write a review asap!
Some of the best points-
1) Friendly Staff and guests.
2) Free breakfast in a big room with everyone (you can talk and network a lot trust me!)
3) They have free dinner on Monday Wednesday and Friday.
4) A happening place when you step out. (Clubs Cafes Restaurants everything!)
5) There are many more things like a massage chair bike rentals at just $25 private tours (paid) free internet and computer use laundry service (paid) etc.

If you are an adventurous person this is just the place for you!
I met some amazing people here around the world and this changed my perspective of a traveller's life. I would definitely come here again."

4518031,431294846,2019-03-31,55975322,Alicia,This was my first time staying in a hostel. I was so impressed. Checkin was super easy. There are events every night of the week for guests to participate in.  You’re very well informed. They have ping pong pool musical instruments. The kitchen set up was also very convenient. I wish I had stayed longer than one night.
1578597,265936164,2018-05-18,177401799,Elizabeth,A great little place to stay. The bed was comfortable the wifi was reliable and check in/out was very easy. JP and Joel were friendly and welcoming when I ran into them. Although you can use public transportation or Lyft to get around I recommend walking up the hill at least once to get the true San Francisco experience.
2178509,97491126,2016-08-27,81022284,Jessica,Wonderful house in the Mission District. Location was ideal nice value. We had a great stay.

2202505,181357773,2017-08-12,1008592,Etienne,"La maison d'Amanda est parfaitement situé à San Francisco dans un endroit très calme et près des quartiers intéressants comme les Heights Mission et Castro ( walking distance). La maison est aussi proche du Golden Gate Park. C'est un quartier essentiellement résidentiel très agréable.

La maison d'Amanda offre la possibilité d'accueillir 6 7 personnes avec 2 chambres et un sofa Bed. Elle offre 2 salles de bain et un toilette séparée ce qui est un luxe. Elle possède également un jardin très agréable . 

Malheureusement notre expérience de cette maison est très mitigée. En effet la maison mériterait un rafraîchissement sérieux et la propreté du lieu ne correspondait pas à nos exigences. 

Vous devez également être informés que un chien vit habituellement dans la maison.

Nous avons également eu des soucis à notre arrivée . En effet le sofa bed ne possédait pas de draps de nombreux poils de chiens le couvrait et nous n'avions pas de serviettes propres à notre disposition. Nous n'avons d'ailleurs pas utilisé le sofa bed qui se trouve dans une pièce agréable mais qui est sans doute la pièce du chien ce qui se ressent fortement.

Nous avons résolu le problème des draps et des serviettes avec l'aide d'Amanda mais en devant faire nous meme une lessive et trouver les draps dans la cave.

La communication avec Amanda était excellente et très rapide. Elle a répondu très rapidement à l'ensemble de mes questions et à essayé de résoudre les soucis à distance malgré son séjour sur la côte Est. Amanda nous a d'ailleurs gentiment proposé de nous offrir des glaces à l'ensemble de la famille pour s'excuser des désagréments."
3759246,109144698,2016-10-19,100096437,Carlos,The place was great! David was an excellent host! Close to good and beach! 
1511076,463694358,2019-06-03,137820012,Eva,"Hands down the best Airbnb in our two week California roadtrip!

The space is beautiful bright colorful and very cozy.  The location could not have been better as well - the appartement is situated right in front of Dolores park in between the lively neighbourhouds of Mission and Castro. You will find no shortage of great food and trendy bars in this area!

And if you need some guidance on where to go the hosts Gary and Jefferson have prepared a list with some of their favorite to- ""do's/eat's/see's"". If you like it a little more low key you make use of the picnic basket they've put together for you and enjoy the chill vibe in Dolores park.

Lastly a special shoutout to Gary and Jefferson for making us feel very welcome!"
20155822,461563569,2019-05-31,2372974,Diego,Great space! Location is perfect near restaurants coffee shops and bus runs right outside the front door which makes it really convenient to get to and from the Financial District. I will definitely be staying here again when I visit San Francisco!
516836,26481834,2015-02-14,24385720,Donna,"My daughter and I had a great first experience using airbnb.  We stayed at Fran's house for two nights February 11-13 in the Potrearo Hill section of San Francisco.  It was a perfect location in San Francisco in a nice neighborhood and so convenient to everything we wanted to see.  The views from the house were spectacular from the street and upstairs bedroom.  It was very clean and the accommodations were very comfortable.  The ability to park right outside the house was really great.  Fran couldn't have been a nicer host so friendly and hospitable.  She recommended a few good places to go and she especially wanted to make sure we were safe when we went out at night.  We loved the Plow breakfast café which was so close to her house.  The breakfast was the best I ever had especially the ricotta pancakes.  We were able to see Alcatraz Chinatown Pacific Heights Lombard Street and Union Square all within close proximity.  Thank you Fran for sharing your lovely home with us.

17434665,239421748,2018-03-01,20645446,Benedict,I loved staying at Steve's place!

Firstly Shawna was so sweet and inviting. We only saw her once because we were out and about a lot but when we did see her she was so funny and sweet. Her animals were also a definite plus. Tutu and whiskey her two kitties were very sweet and inviting. The apartment was clean and comfortable and she even had coffee for us in then morning! She was the best! "
21790309,465421824,2019-06-07,103997783,Steven,Very clean good communication great view of the courtyard.  Would recommend to friends.
22636987,454149538,2019-05-17,3220199,Meggan,Above and beyond the best private room I have ever stayed at on Airbnb. The bed was ridiculously comfortable — luxury linens plenty of pillows. The bathroom was well appointed with a shower out of a dream — 20' rain head with plenty of heat and perfect pressure. I was travelling for work and up early and home late so there wasn't much interaction between anyone in the house. Along with that I did hear the other alarms from the house go off in the morning so if you are planning on sleeping in bring earplugs.
32727389,536458461,2019-09-26,69059603,Marc,"Jennifer is a great host...thanks again for muffins and cake :)

We had a great stay at her place with easy self check-in/out. The apartment was really nice cozy and clean. The area is also great - just a short walk to Bernal Heights with a very beautiful scenic view on the city.

We would definitely stay here again!"

Michael (landlord) was very helpful every time I need assistance.
I recommend this place as a great option to stay in San Francisco."

31439076,511733733,2019-08-17,253710236,Guadalupe,Kathy’s place was very pretty and clean. It is located in a nice and quiet area. A bit far from touristy areas if you plan on using the public transport.
2488520,20916430,2014-10-07,2935630,David,Awesome place. Huge well decorated and comfortable. Super clean. Gabe was a great host very accommodating flexible and even recommended his favorite restaurants. Place is a bit off the beaten path but really a great place and super host!
15346876,149314504,2017-05-03,12532441,Kim,We had an excellent experience at Kamal's. He was thoughtful helpful and  his property exceeded our expectations.  The location views and access to public transportation made this an ideal place for us to stay. We would not hesitate to return.
5094146,129691646,2017-02-01,50273519,Nabil,"Abhay is probably one of the finest persons’ you would meet in this city! He is simple yet refreshingly honest in his views well read and a flamboyant conversationalist (what would you expect for an IIT/ IIM pass out!). He will give you the space you need (when u need your time alone) and will go the extra mile in helping you figure things out when you are staying with him. His house mate Namrata is equally amiable and together they made sure I had one of the best stay’s in one of the most beautiful cities’ in the world. 

Abhay’s house is clean modern and fits the description to the hilt. The bathroom is heated the futon is surprisingly good and comfortable to sleep on - I spent 5 nights on it without breaking into a sweat. The open area offers a clear and picturesque view of the city on a clear day and ‘Cody’ the dog is super friendly and adorable! The Mission St/ Valencia St - are all close by and offer plenty of options to eat drink and be merry :) - Abhay will only be too glad to offer advice depending upon your interests and needs. 

I would recommend staying with Abhay to everyone who is travelling solo to SF. This is one stay you will walk out of with not just a great AirBnb experience but in all likelihood a good friend too!

Cheers.

17723975,139477000,2017-03-25,43509053,Mark,Great place. We spent more than a week here with my girlfriend. It was a perfect decision. Amazing view from the window. Safe and nice location. With a car it was only 15 minutes to the SF city center. The place was clean and really comfortable. Contact with the host was really nice and fast. Great value for the money experience. Good internet connection. And I have to write it again... the window view from the living room was absolutely stunning. I would recommend this place to everyone. 
6015077,229449960,2018-01-23,46475514,Gloriane,The host was very attentive we had some issues the day before with our rental car and had no time to sightseeing the first day. She allowed us to leave our  luggage until we were done touristing. She also was very responsive anytime we needed to communicate she pick the phone right away no matter the time. Totally recommend this place to stay. The icing on the cake is the view from the master bedroom!
664307,420457578,2019-03-06,238792785,Francisco Salvador,Geoff was always so kind to me asking if i needed anything really have a lovely place at Missión Distric a clean and charming room if you´re looking for a safe-quiet neighborhood this is the place i can get felt homey. Easy ride from  San Francisco International Airport (Block and a half from 24 St. Mission BART Station and MUNI Lines) there is a lot of local restaurants and bars at the área. I hope to go back soon.
4526608,207753298,2017-10-29,103902784,Dan,Chris and Tex were excellent hosts friendly and provided very timely communication. Place is nice with backyard to enjoy that is dog friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay.
28548553,460624322,2019-05-29,25570793,Tanya,Everything about the home was wonderful. Extremely cleaned and well stocked. Nice neighborhood close to local stores restaurants and Starbucks. Love the setup and very spacious. My group had a lovely stay in Fabiola's beautifully maintained home. Lots of special touches in the kitchen and dining area. Everything was fully stocked in the fridge and cabinets. No problems at all. Would definitely stay again. Thanks for the hospitality!!
2046634,13644792,2014-06-02,4970400,Tim,The whole experience was excellent.  The common areas bathroom and individual bedroom were immaculate.  I was able to park my motorcycle at the foot of the stairs up to the unit making coming and going most easy.  The bedroom window brought in the cool refreshing San Francisco breezes at night.  My only complaint: the numbers on the front gate lock box were hard to read at night.
3486460,103788949,2016-09-24,72737932,Stefanie,"We had een amazing stay with Emily! Great and big house with everything you need including 2 adorable kittens. The view of SF is incredible and the garden is really cosy. Emily is a great host! She is very friendly gave us a lot of tips and made us feel like home. Good busconnections and quiet neighbourhood with easy parking.
If we come back to SF we will definitely stay here again!!"
7844031,176234097,2017-07-30,47206559,Ken,I had a wonderful stay in Barry's apartment. It was exactly as pictured - a large very well-appointed apartment and everything was meticulously kept. The location is terrific - central with lots of amenities just steps away. Barry is a terrific host - he responded quickly and was very helpful with all questions including terrific suggestions of local places to visit. He lives upstairs and is very easy to get in touch with when you have questions but otherwise allows you your privacy. A first rate experience - thank you Barry!
35840351,515340692,2019-08-22,21286897,Alisa,It's a good place to stay in pricey San Francisco. Rooms are on the top floor of a well restored beautiful mansion. Very clean and well organized. High quality bedding and coffee machine much appreciated. The only downside is the shared bathroom. If another guest is taking a long shower the closest alternative is across the street in the Whole Foods market. Overall we had a great time.

It's even better than it looks in the pictures. We didn't get to see Nathan in person but he was a wonderful very attentive host. Highly recommended if you're looking for a place to stay in SF. 
148769,508169456,2019-08-12,110008162,Livy,I really appreciate Kyle for bringing such a good experience.  The process has gone a little bit and we are ready to come back to Table Mountain next time but Kyle's so sincere and nice so we feel that we have to experience it with him this time.  Kyle is really a very intimate guide. Since we are all climbing for the first time he chose the most suitable route for us. Let us rest properly when we are tired. Give us the best when we need to replenish energy.  Best coffee and tea the most authentic snacks the whole hiking is very comfortable absolutely recommended thank you again Kyle for bringing such a good experience!

We loved our stay there and highly recommend their place to anyone who is visiting San Fran.

There is a reason why Laykoon is a super host! She is very kind and caring. We had a wonderful stay!"
8438267,152311192,2017-05-15,1642414,Matthew,Terrific place for my first time in San Francisco - lovely neighbourhood with terrific coffee shops and cafes close by and very easy to get into central SF. I would certainly stay there again on another trip.
998701,37549251,2015-07-08,13258844,Kell,We had a great experience at Martha's beach cottage. The location was perfect. It's right near a beautiful beach and very close to public transport into the city. The area also had a lot of nice cafes and restaurants as well (great coffee and cinnamon toast at Trouble Coffee!). Marta was an incredible host. She went above above and beyond to make our San Francisco stay a great experience. We will definitely be recommending her cottage to our friends and hope to be back very soon. Thanks again Martha.

256148,1597148,2012-06-30,2197672,Christiane,We stayed three days in Chris' apartment. Everything was perfectly arranged and clean. It is a nice and safe neighborhood and close to public transportation. We would recommend it to everyone.
351978,190218883,2017-09-03,139182966,J.B.,This is a good house for someone moving to San Francisco like me.  The host is very responsive and considerate of any concerns. I would recommend the Trumbull house for your short term stay.
1629740,15517999,2014-07-10,837577,Kenneth,"It's a great location and an amazing hotel room. The pictures do not do the room justice. It is significantly better in person. The hotel also has parking next door. It's really hard to beat this place for the price. They also have an amazing top floor terrace with a decent gym. I would rather stay here than pay 3xs as much for the W.

Dana was always quick to respond to our questions via email.

11886255,485938091,2019-07-11,260852345,Hooman,The studio was perfect for two people. Location was great as it was walking distance to the Bart tram and lots of restaurants nearby. Only issue was that there were lots of homeless people below the building which could be scary for some people. The management was quick to respond to any queries.

1205031,16618894,2014-07-30,361438,Beatriz,"I really enjoyed my stay at Wilmer and Colin's. The room is just as described and seen on the photos has everything you need for your stay in San Francisco. The apartment is located in SoMa a 10 minute walk from Financial District very convenient if you are in San Francisco for work as was my case. The building was undergoing renovation but it was very nice and safe. 
Wilmer is really lovely and both he and Colin are very respectful and considerate hosts. You have all the privacy you need and they are available and very helpful if you need anything. The room has a private bathroom and is on a different level than that of the hosts' so you won't get in each other's way. The bed was as confi as described and the bedroom window opens to a quiet alley so if you like you can sleep with your windows open to let the air in. WiFi connection worked great. There is plenty of closet room to put away your clothes and shoes. There were bathroom toiletries and a new bar of Castille soap as well as a blowdryer available. The very best thing: I had a cup of fresh coffee brought to my door every morning - although maybe I shouldn't say this on the review as I might be setting up a standard here! 
I will definitely stay at Wilmer's again when I am back in San Francisco. ¡Muchas gracias!"

7073115,202040500,2017-10-09,28693645,John,This was my second stay with Isaac and Doug and it was exactly as I expected based on my previous stay. Clean comfortable unit with a private entrance and excellent hosts. I also like the neighborhood. I feel very safe walking to restaurants after dark and it is convenient to public transit. Available street parking is also a big plus.

The neighborhood is safe and it's easy to find places to eat. The apartment is spacious very clean and spotless. Easy access to public transit. Would definitely plan a stay there again. Highly recommended!
7222704,71174287,2016-04-24,6356766,Alexandra,Dennis and Nancy were very easy to work with- they provided easy access instructions prior to our arrival and we had no issues finding it. We ran into them while they were sitting outside the unit and they made us feel very welcome and offered lots of tips for nearby points of interest. The unit is charming thoughtfully decorated and stocked with everything you need. The neighborhood contains many nearby gems and is within easy walking distance of Bakers beach and the gorgeous batteries to bluffs trail. But the neighborhood is a bit aways away from many parts of the city so depending on your itinerary that may be something you wish to keep in mind. 
11183089,314462652,2018-08-26,92518368,Alison,This location was great for a visit to SF! Nice amenities and a comfortable size!

1474209,43574758,2015-08-20,15543104,Sarah,Great location and the room was just as described. Such a nice place to come back to after walking around San Francisco all day! The bed was super cozy. The only thing that was a little annoying was the shower didn't drain so the tub was half way full by the time you finished showering. I'd still totally stay here again though!
20154622,279788238,2018-06-21,165293000,Michael,Quiet cozy spot very conveniently located near the SFO airport. Lance and Marilyn were very hospitable and offered us many local travel tips! The breakfast in the morning was absolutely to die for!

Absolute Pole Position on the Pier 39 Marina!
Most brilliant view on Alcatraz and even on „the bridge“ - in our case distracted by fog.
Shame on you Frisco weather!

Fisherman’s Wharf is close by and the lazy sea lions are literally „around the corner“.

Wanna have Frisco in a nutshell?
Get on board!
Now!

P.S. Edward is a really nice host :-)"
21914,42452147,2015-08-13,39847233,Christopher,Aaron was a nice host. The apartment has a great location really close to golden gate park and several bus routes and a train line. The room I stayed in was at the front of the house literally overlooking the train line. The train runs every 10 minutes making it convenient to take it anywhere but there is a loud train running by averaging every 5 minutes because they pass out of sync... it does get less frequent after 9 though but they do run all night.  The kitchen and bathrooms were always kept quite clean. The industrial refrigerator also has plenty of room for whatever you would want to keep in there which was great. The washer and dryer require the majority of a roll of quarters to operate... 
8101297,498428482,2019-07-29,250846722,Bart & Julie,A lovely apartment with a cute french bulldog living there. Nearby sea & lots of shops & restaurants. Safe area & perfect spot to discover the city. Watch out where you park (cleaning days - fines!).

6074750,242396235,2018-03-11,65704973,Bruno,Really nice room in a quiet street a rock throw away from Chinatown and Little Italy so there's always something to do or something delicious to eat around there. 20 minute walk to Market Street too so not too far from downtown. Good hosts with good local tips too. Definitely enjoyed my trip.
9435665,156712507,2017-05-31,9229983,Erin,Had a really lovely week here! Bed and linens were comfy there was plenty of climate control in home and individual rooms and the home is situated very nicely. It's conveniently close to public transportation. Maria is a great host--friendly and welcoming--and we enjoyed meeting the other guests. 
6119683,276107716,2018-06-12,16203730,Katie,"Dino and James’s place is amazing! It is in a great place for the mission district night life (there is even a good bar/nightclub next door). They have really good recommendations for food places.

Lots of shops etc nearby for anything you need. The local park is lovely and within easy walking distance. You need to get an Uber or the BART to all the main sights but it’s a good location as a base.

The bedroom/bathroom is perfectly private and spotlessly clean! Their 3 x small dogs are lovely and friendly. All the people living there are really approachable and friendly. They even invited us to their BBQ with their friends. The shared areas are amazing and stylish. The whole house/garden is very stylish and modern.

Can’t fault this place at all. We had an amazing time! Thankyou "
12797906,489964286,2019-07-17,31025930,Lisa,Awesome location near GG Park. Lots of restaurants nearby. Fanny left lots of good suggestions for local restaurants (which were good btw). Super easy check in etc.

Her house is beautiful incredibly clean and stocked with breakfast items and toiletries. The bed was extremely comfortable the dining room was spacious and flooded with light and the location was ideal- walking distance to the lower height Castro and mission. We had a wonderful stay and really enjoyed Anka. We would recommend her place to anyone visiting sf.

29002725,359428895,2018-12-16,14613058,Quang,"Location is amazing. Right at the heart of China town and next to Little Italy. Lots of good food options around. About 15 minutes walking distance to lots of places. 

Apartment was not clean when check-in but the host communicated and sent cleaners right away to sort it out. (Thus my 4/5 stars.)

11531859,233232728,2018-02-08,65675250,Lily,I was in SF for two nights and I enjoyed my (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication between Kathy and Sabrina was fast and they responded to my requests such as turning up the heat when the room got cold (I was the only airbnb guest at the time so it didn't affect other guests who may have been in the other room). Detailed information on check-in and out made the whole process go smoothly. There was plenty of street parking so I didn't have to worry about walking far to get my car. Thank you for hosting Kathy and Sabrina!
24463,179155871,2017-08-06,7050014,Izell,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Cathryn was an incredible host. I thoroughly enjoyed our kitchen chats and she checked in with us to make sure we were comfortable. The house was clean with a gorgeous view of San Fran and in such a lively part of town. Easy walk to restaurants yoga studios coffee shops and Whole Foods. I highly recommend this place and would stay again in a heartbeat.
18916321,262691090,2018-05-09,19196251,Hilana,Thea e Carlo foram ótimos anfitriões. Nos deixaram à vontade e respeitaram nossa privacidade. A cama era confortável e o quarto super bem decorado. Só é importante lembrar que o bairro fica um pouco distante dos principais pontos turísticos mas há várias paradas de Muni por perto e para quem está de carro é fácil de estacionar.

It's such a beautiful house full of love! 
We had the whole house for us and if we needed something Valerie came over to bring to us! She is such a sweet and nice Person and we still can't believe her age ;)
The house was perfect the BART Station to Downtown / Fisherman's Wharf is a 2 minutes walk away from the house.
It was just a perfect stay! If we will some back to SFwe definitly will come back to the BSpot!
Thank you so much again for having us Valerie!"

Nancy et son hospitalité sa chaleur son intelligence pétillante et son aura bienveillante sera sans aucun doute le sommet de notre voyage. S'il est un lieu où trouver tant d'humanité de générosité et d'ouverture d'esprit le temps d'un sejour dans cette ville c'est ici. 

We thought to find a welcoming house and a caring hostess we were still below what was waiting for us it's a friend we left with regret. Nancy and her hospitality warmth sparkling intelligence and caring aura will undoubtedly be the highlight of our trip. If there is one place where to find so much humanity generosity and openness for a stay in this city is here."
3257886,426356715,2019-03-20,158908302,Sumiko,Kathy and Matt’s place was nice place for budget travelers. SF is very expensive to stay in general but their place had comfortable beds kitchen and small outdoor space to sit.  The free street parking was easy to find.  The shower was tiny and no washer but that was just minor things we came across. Matt came to talk to us and gave us a delicious bottle of wine!  They were great hosts! Thank you so much!!
31339864,486551082,2019-07-12,9272203,Helen,A really spacious room with a desk that will adjust to height you need. Bed is really comfortable and stylish.  Walking up the stairs is worth it as you have a nice small balcony.   Sharing the bathroom was not a big deal.  I just left a note for my neighbor indicating when I hoped to shower so it worked out fine.  The room was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of union square.
3112427,19410941,2014-09-12,2273043,Rick,"When i arrived at Christina and Matthew's  I immediately fell in love with the space.  As a single traveler this place is more then enough for me to enjoy.  this place is better then a 5 star hotel suite.  It has personality it is clean tidy efficient use of space incredible vies quaint little garden with two lovely chickens which i adores and how can I forget to mention that it's a very beautiful community to live. 

I love them as hosts for they provided me with everything I need for my stay...  I even have coffee every morning.  She reminded me about the street cleaning.  My experience with them has been so good it really improve my quality of my stay in San Francisco.

I give the place and the hosts more then 5 start if I may...  I'll definitely stay with them next time I get back to the city."

8048653,338908251,2018-10-20,111244087,Alperen,Emanuel and Eric are definetely deserve their title with super host. If you don’t mind being a bit far away from the centre this’s a very good spot. I didn’t use the public transportation as I came with a car but it seems very close to house.
2956406,68323915,2016-04-04,575727,Claire,by FAR the BEST airbnb host i've ever experienced. he was so good about getting back to my emails almost (Website hidden by Airbnb) friend and i felt SO taken care of from the moment we arrived! he explained everything to us in great detail and helped us with MUNI (the public transportation) told us the good local restaurants and gave us lots of tips. the place was spotless and in an amazing location! about a 15 minute ride right into the city. I love the Outer Sunset! and can't want to come back! :) Thanks Simon!

Gina was the perfect host always on hand for directions and restaurant recommendations. We felt really welcome and really enjoyed our stay. I can't say a bad thing about the Apartment.
If we visit San Fran again then this would be where we would stay.

21799501,246642781,2018-03-25,54317428,Kelly,Miranti's place was a wonderful place to stay. It was spacious for a family of three very clean and in a safe quiet neighborhood. Miranti let us check-in late as we arrived into San Fran on a late evening flight. She made up the sofa bed for my daughter and everything was ready for us. She had snacks and drinks ready for us and coffee and hot chocolate for the morning.  It was a perfect stay and I highly recommend this place. Thanks Miranti for being so hospitable and quick to respond!!
13687255,402844941,2019-01-19,93177668,Teresa,Had a great stay at Palmore’s. The home was lovely even better than the photos showed. Loved the neighborhood and easy walking distance to fantastic dining as well as close proximity to the Caltrain. Would definitely stay here again.

2614717,331818493,2018-10-03,33140126,Ingegerd,We just loved staying with Sonia and Jason!!! Can´t find a single tiny thing to complain about. Only a lot to be happy about! The home of Sonia Jason and their dogs is full of life joy and love. A warm and personal welcome when we arrived. During the week many small talks in the kitchen getting good and exciting advice of what to do in and around SF. Felt just as much at (Website hidden by Airbnb) at home. Our room was large with a nice view over the inviting garden. Not to mention the so very much comfortable bed! Peaceful neighbourhood great walks to the Ocean or to the Golden Gate Park. Frequent and nearby buses which took us where ever we wanted to go. Thank you for being such wonderful hosts. Our absolutely warmest recommendations. Hope to see you again!

12741695,352847496,2018-11-25,78858641,Alia,David's place was perfect! The entrance has a code and its easy to get in and out. Our place was through the front door and down the stairs. David's place is upstairs. We actually got an earlier flight and showed up way earlier than I had previously told David. He was very accommodating and made us feel welcome. His dog Desmo is extremely well behaved and friendly! Desmo likes to meet you at the front door when coming in or out for pets then heads back upstairs. We were out and about most of the time but this place was a comfortable place to come back to. It was very clean stylish and private. Definitely recommend!

Even though the heaters were being installed during my stay Cecilia went above and beyond to make sure I wasn't inconvenienced even though I had absolutely no problems with the work being done. 
I would definitely stay here again. Thanks for making my stay more enjoyable and affordable!"

The room is lovely and Marcia is a very engaging host who we enjoyed chatting with and getting her wonderful suggestions on where to eat and what to see.

The apartment is in a fantasic location great for public transport and the many cafes and restaurants in the surrounding streets. Indeed we ended up walking to a lot of the surrounding districts to check out the hip little shops.

Cannot speak highly enough of the place and highly recommend it to anyone considering where to stay in san fran!"
1511076,261676325,2018-05-06,92356945,Dan,The location being across the street from Mission Delores Park was perfect for relaxing and BiRite Creamery is right on the corner. Easy walk to Mission District and Castro. The place a bedroom and adjoining sunny living room are graced with lots of esoteric art as is the whole apt truly wonderful! Gary made everything so super easy. Hope to be back again next time I’m in San Francisco.

2677288,20528191,2014-09-30,16756656,Katie,This room and stay was perfect for my quick trip to the SF music conservatory. Located close to a muni stop--made it really easy to get around! A little bit noisy especially at night but due to construction which is out of anyone's control. James was (Website hidden by Airbnb) kind accommodating and fun to talk to as well. Would recommend for anyone to stay here in a heartbeat!
3594786,39552907,2015-07-24,10478524,Jory,"Gorgeous clean modern apartment in the heart of the mission. Insiya's place is steps from all my favorite spots to eat and drink and super close to the 16th street Bart station. The bed was soooo comfortable and the light in the room was beautiful.

Insiya was super quick to respond and so nice! Would definite stay again!"
929468,4595169,2013-05-14,5509885,Séverine,We had a great time in John's loft : it is modern clean and very well located (ie not far from central Castro and quiet neighbourhood at the same time). We recommend it!
11104122,86419765,2016-07-16,78018563,Paul,Wonderful home in a great location with a very engaged and responsive host - what more could you want?  Quiet at night but very close to all of the amenities you could want clean safe and roomy.  We really felt comfortable in Dan's home and he was very proactive throughout our stay.  We will be referring friends to this location for their future trips to SF based on both the home and Dan.  Thank you for helping to make our trip so relaxing and enjoyable.  One last thing: the views of this home are unbeatable.  The picture from the deck is both exactly real and correct - but it doesn't (and cannot) capture how wonderful it is!
1623609,210490596,2017-11-09,141165297,Bobby,"What a great place!  Super easy access to bus lines that take you right into the city if you want to take a little financial break from Lyft/Uber.  The mini refrigerator was stocked with complimentary wine and beverages plus there's a coffee maker microwave and toaster!   Very clean and quiet too both inside and from the street.  Bed was very comfortable and the 50"" (55""?) hi-def TV was a big bonus!   Wi-Fi was very dependable and lots of space overall!    I love the no-smoking rule too as you can always tell when someone who smokes had the room before you.   :)     Thanks Ingrid!   Will definitely stay there again on my next trip."
224579,556512908,2019-10-29,31741862,Shelby,Armelle's home was a treat to stay in! The location is in The Mission where we found a lot of fun restaurants and coffee shops. It was quiet at night and her home had a lovely view of the city. We were very comfortable and pleased with our stay. Armelle herself was on vacation but that didn't stop her from being an amazing host! She was in touch around the time of our check in and check out to ensure we got in okay - and there were fires going on in California so she was sure to make sure we were okay and was available for questions. I would recommend her home to my friends and family for sure!
3257886,30282850,2015-04-20,16243438,Orla,Everything we needed for a great few days in San Francisco. The apartment is comfortably laid out and close to the Park Beach and N Judah line into town. We spent most of our time out and about but met Matt on the first day and he was warm welcoming and provided lots of useful advice.
12368621,526406778,2019-09-08,132071151,Steve,Beautiful apartment in stately Pacific Heighrs. Everything better than described.
774323,27387413,2015-03-03,25350565,Rick,Three things with an airbnb:  host experience location and comfort. Jan and her place is awesome in all three regards. Jan is welcoming there when you need her and not there when you don't makes you feel completely at home helpful kind and funny as hell. The location is perfect. Try the hidden gem around the corner for your morning coffee the video store. Bed is the best we have ever slept in!!!  This one is a pure winner; we were enriched by the experience. My gf and thriller are now besties. 
1104912,62594939,2016-02-15,25766629,Erica,Awesome location if you're looking to stay away from the craziness of the city but close enough to bus or über to all of the major attractions. The apartment was very clean and nice to come back to after a long day out you can hear footsteps and noise from the house above but overall it wasn't an issue. Would definitely come back again!
1261122,6986682,2013-09-02,7443708,Nora,"My husband and I just spent the weekend (3 nights) at Sharon's lovely and cozy rental apartment in West Portal neighborhood San Francisco.  We really enjoyed our stay!  The apartment is adorable and very clean.  The location couldn't be more convenient especially for muni travelers such as we were!  The station is about 2 blocks away.  We only met Sharon for a moment but she was so very kind and friendly!  We are hoping to go back sometime and stay again!  We definitely recommend this rental!  We had a wonderful 3 days in San Francisco!

4887475,166559763,2017-07-03,56259650,Cinnette,We had a great stay. The only issues were the 3 flights of stairs with all of our luggage but that's more because I have a shoulder issue. The location was in walking distance to lots of good stuff the staff was wonderful and the room and bathrooms were nice and clean. It was pretty pricey for a private bunk room so staying again might not be ideal unless I was splitting costs (I stayed here with my teenage son). Otherwise it really was lovely and I will spread the word. Great experience. 
4121114,271915850,2018-06-02,14431412,Michael,Sauberes Zimmer mit guter Anbindung an öffentlichen Verkehr Bus S-Bahn usw. Schöne Lage gerne wieder. 
10321776,304072840,2018-08-08,147696076,Rachel,Arpita was very responsive when we had questions. When upstairs guests come in it can be a bit loud but once they were all the way upstairs the noise was much less. The place was very nice to stay in and my husband and I enjoyed the coffee and the fridge space. It was very easy to find public transportation and get to the beach from this location.
24654041,563065122,2019-11-11,56551893,Phillies,Andrew's place was clean organized and convenient. Our room was well equipped with all the supplies needed and the house was well organized and functional. The ease of staying here really made for an enjoyable and comfortable stay. The location is really easy to get around either with public transit or by car. There are lots of options of places to walk around in the area depending on what you are looking for - nature or shops. Will definitely book with Andrew again next time I am in San Francisco!
21866860,410149240,2019-02-09,2283353,Melanie,Paula's place was the perfect spot.  It is sparkling clean and very comfortable.  I appreciated all of the nice touches including great breakfast options and my favorite local brand of shampoo/bath gel.   This spot is an oasis at the end of a long day of travel or work.

4632133,443345980,2019-04-25,256430197,Ross,Clean well maintained excellent location to tourist attractions and the owners are extremely nice and accommodating. The parking on site makes this an idea location if you have a car rental and want to explore knowing that your car is safe.
501770,29043703,2015-04-03,471616,Lan,This apartment could not have been more perfect for us.  Location was excellent with great food and fun shops within 3-5 blocks.  The pad was thoughtfully stocked with everything we needed including basic kitchen ingredients and bath necessities - even laundry detergent. It was clean and very roomy.  We loved the many windows that open and allowed loads of light and fresh air when needed.  The doors are equipped with keypads so no need to go pick up keys-which makes things so easy.  Public transportation was also within walking distance.  Arthur our host was very accessible by phone and so friendly and helpful.  We will definitely stay in this apartment or any of Arthur's apartments next time we are in town.  
4782281,282203775,2018-06-26,188312964,Brek,Daniel was extremely responsive throughout the process.

21558062,488950117,2019-07-15,164641412,Stephen,This spot is in a great quiet San Francisco neighborhood and keeps you away from the hustle and bustle.  But it is also a short drive to the great SF attractions.  Just up the street in a small quaint park is a great view of the ocean and just around the corner the other direction is a great view of the top of the Golden Gate bridge!!  A great comfortable space to stay and the host is available and willing to communicate very quickly if you need him.  Easy slick check-in.

1844877,48867815,2015-09-29,7871640,Dena,Great apartment with everything you need in it from a fully equipped kitchen to a nice outdoor area with a view. Staying in the Potrero area felt like living in the suburbs of San Fran fell in love with the Chiotras deli 1.5 blocks away (amazing sandwiches!) and recommend breakfast at Plow nearby. Sebastian was very responsive and helpful thank you! 
6716133,43782001,2015-08-22,21088515,Shanda,"This is my favorite airbnb host and home so far!  I chose this location for its proximity to SFSU.  The home is also located a couple of blocks from BART station muni shopping and restaurants.  The home itself is wonderful...clean modern and all amenities you can think of!  The whole suite was great but I really loved the bathroom and the kitchen area all designed in a smart way!  
Although I didn't get to meet Deborah in person she was very easy and pleasant to communicate with!  I'd recommend the Suite Retreat in a heart beat!"

9187534,120090685,2016-12-07,63261231,Kumar,Great place Audry was an amazing host.  The apartment close to a lot of restaurants and bars but still very quite and peaceful.  I never had any issues and if I am ever back in town I will be staying at her place.
7026287,338851913,2018-10-20,14140614,Melanie,I stayed here previously and it was so comfortable and convenient that I made sure to book it again. The space is peaceful and private  and Melissa & Nicole are fantastic hosts - thoughtful and very responsive.
7949668,427457833,2019-03-23,135251458,Daniel,Rinia's place was absolutely beautiful! It made my first stay in San Francisco amazing! The bed was comfortable the room and the bathroom were very clean there was plenty of storage for my clothes and other items. The only thing I wish she had was a microwave and a coffee maker in the room other than that it was an amazing place to stay! Also for those who have never been to San Fran I was worried when I discovered they did not have any air conditioning but I discovered that San Fran was cold enough that it wasn't necessary just be sure to keep the windows and curtains closed while you are out so the sun doesn't bake the room!
2677288,275758399,2018-06-11,2092650,Marcelo,Great location; plenty of public transportation to move around; communication with James was excellent. The place was clean bed comfortable. Window to the street;  some noise on weekends. Not a problem for me though. I will recommend it to friends. Thanks James.
21425660,541132761,2019-10-04,277954549,Evyn,Excellent accommodation! Hoping to stay there again in the future
5852066,256375615,2018-04-22,21704559,Larry,The location is awesome and Paul is very prompt and courteous to respond. His apartment was clean and the living space and kitchen are clean and has everything you need. I highly recommend it!
28499025,417023644,2019-02-25,84140627,Krystal,James was an amazing host had a booklet in the room with very useful tips! The walls are a bit thin so you are able to hear everything but it didn’t bother us at all the room was clean & very spacious. Everything was clean as pictured had a wonderful time thank you again for allowing us to stay in your home!
7292878,56167259,2015-12-09,2392891,Heath,This place is absolutely gorgeous and Jane and Rob were so accommodating and kind. I was much later than I had planned for checkin and they were patient and understanding (though I should have been on time!). The view is incredible; the neighborhood is lovely; the house super clean and cozy; and the bed ridiculously comfortable. A really special and unique spot. Thanks so much! 
2677288,39579835,2015-07-24,8122229,Vincent,Great host excellent room and location!
7715542,50005776,2015-10-08,5413548,Krisztina,A great place to stay in San Fransisco close to the bay especially for a short stay. I was there for a business trip.
20217846,522228588,2019-09-01,220311616,Mwesi,One of the best location. Tegan has a cool spot.
7902505,328957726,2018-09-27,72246972,Richard,Great place very clean and great location for the price.  Close to downtown and Whole Foods is down the street. Easy Uber rides from here and they show up in minutes.
12437037,210705628,2017-11-10,120238602,Dave,Sandy's place was a perfect base for my wife and I to explore SF... especially as we wanted to spend time exploring golden gate park. Very convenient
17438541,504408773,2019-08-07,36601664,Yannick,Very good
21847778,340381347,2018-10-23,216794125,Roxanne,"Andy was an amazing host. If you need more room try to scoop both of his listings. I can’t think of a single negative thing to say except that he has set the bar very high and probably spoiled me for all my future Airbnb experiences. 

To Andy’s future visitors: you are going to leave wishing your house was half as organized as Andy’s."
1226596,57655470,2015-12-28,3436544,Justine,We stayed 4 nights at leslie and gio's place. Their family are indeed very social and helpful people! We had fun playing with their baby who's about a year old. Basic necessities like fresh towels and detergent etc were also available. There was absolute privacy as we were also given a key to lock our room. They have a friendly dog and we even took him out for walks. Transportation wasn't of any problem as there's bus 14 (muni) to union square etc. Overall I would definitely recommend this place!
19416507,401157770,2019-01-13,53357726,Lada,Great location!  Right around the corner from many restaurants bars park etc.  Easy to get around via Uber to main attractions in SF.
4105892,246993315,2018-03-26,30177698,Tamara,This was our second stay Jeannie& Skate are wonderful! Great communication very relaxing place to stay in a nice neighborhood with great restaurants. They have adorable cats and of course an amazing view of the city! Thanks again

189068,21616559,2014-10-20,1822096,Arkan,Mary has been extremely accommodating setting out breakfast snacks in the mornings. Shared washroom is very clean. The room was bright and clean and makes you feel at home which goes a long way when travelling. The neighbourhood has lovely views great food coffee shops and bars. Absolutely recommend Mary's apartment for a couple or a single traveler staying in SF.
8192881,142119142,2017-04-06,14426703,Nick,Apartment was exactly as expected. Amazing location right by some cool shops and places to eat. Waking up the view each morning added to our San Fran experience. Highly recommend!

4387067,143431660,2017-04-11,110878010,Courtney,This spot was awesome! Easy check in and out. Perfect location! Everything is right outside the door.. shopping bars restaurants etc. Very nice and clean room. I would definitely stay here again! 
12115392,241835841,2018-03-10,70772108,Katie,Good location. Close to several great bars and restaurants. Didn’t realize there wasn’t wifi available.
2927781,17855723,2014-08-18,18118339,Beth,"If you are looking for a beautiful place to stay in a fun neighborhood with two GREAT hosts then look mo further!

My husband and I stayed with Charles & René and absolutely enjoyed our stay and would certainly return. It is clear from the moment that you walk into your bedroom and see a very organized binder awaiting you on the bed that these two were born to host! The binder included everything from information about the house neighborhood and public transit to information about restaurants nightlife etc. The binder was not only very helpful but also a clear example of their love for San Francisco and their love of sharing the best of their city with visitors. 

Although our stay there was short it was still very memorable. Their actions speak volumes about their character. Shortly after our arrival René was going to the grocery store and immediately asked if there was anything we needed. A little later that night Charles made some delicious hand-crafted cocktails for us. To top it off we would receive occasional messages from René while we were out and about to let us know they had made some homemade baked goods and for us to feel free to help ourselves whenever we returned ""home.""

Their space is very clean welcoming and has all of the amenities needed to make you feel right at home. It was nice to have a fully stocked kitchen in which we were able to make breakfast both mornings of our stay. 

We had a fabulous stay with these two and would not hesitate one bit to stay with them again if/when we return to San Francisco! Thank you so much Charles & René! Hopefully we will cross paths again!"
33969322,510162601,2019-08-15,19798816,Annie,"Well it's a hotel experience I guess that's what's expected. The room it's nice clean and the lobby is beautiful. 
We tried to walk to a licorice store around the corner.....  It can be dengerous at night outside.  Also we got stuck in the handicap elevator  now that I see the pics can be somehow funny but at that time it was scary and the girls got stressed. We where stocked for about 20 min. So please if you have a stroller you gonna have to carry your baby and the stroller down the stairs to the parking structure. 
Other than that we had a good time."
13239943,121906537,2016-12-19,38202218,Daixuan,Great for price & parking. Little bit outdated but not in a bad way decent and clean.
3946571,89640785,2016-07-29,45940395,Yunjia,Love love this place! Both Lisa and Shiloh are so welcoming and the room is decorated with beautiful vintage details. The neighborhood is at the heart of SF and has so many lovely stores and restaurants around. Would love to pay another visit back soon ;)
840986,21281055,2014-10-14,7115,Dani,Addy and Carlota were excellent hosts. The apartment itself is clean gets great light (when it's sunny in SF) and has a comfortable bed and well-equipped kitchen. There were also nice little touches like snacks and bath products available for use. It's a very convenient location about a 10-15 min walk from BART right on one park and close to another with great views of the city. An easy walk to the Mission but with the peace & quiet of Bernal. 
7663003,337868683,2018-10-17,6294774,Konstantin,I enjoyed my stay at Kerry’s place. Conveniently located plenty of space. Would stay here again!
5480795,324198950,2018-09-16,195304039,Tim,"It is a place to stay but don’t expect anything else. The guy at reception just shrugged his shoulders and grunted when I asked him why the wifi login wouldn’t work. Asked for a wine glass for our room and they didn’t have any. 
I wouldn’t stay there again"
472901,2394135,2012-09-24,3354683,Jeeyun,"Left inspired by Jin's apartment to lead a more minimal lifestyle.  Spotless and comfortable.  Perfect kitchen with anything you could need.  Nice large bathroom.  Very comfortable bed.  Apartment is very quiet and secure.

Jin is very quick to respond to messages and a very gracious host."
20424542,450207701,2019-05-08,111341690,Jacklyn,This is definitely a spot we will come back to next time we come back to San Francisco. The place was perfect for two people. The price was great for the location. It was the cheapest price I found for San Francisco. Michael was also very friendly and accommodated our early check in. All around great experience and I will be recommending to family and friends.
14125,106429122,2016-10-06,38207592,John,We had a wonderful stay at Olivia's Airbnb in the Mission district of San Francisco. Our accommodation was roomy comfortable and quiet. Olivia and Anthony were excellent hosts both friendly and helpful. The Mission district has a vibrant culture with excellent restaurants and small independent and interesting shops close by. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you Olivia and Anthony for enabling us to have a really enjoyable week in San Francisco.
15564777,180977311,2017-08-11,6787226,Jeffrey,"Sarah and her family were more than accommodating during our stay.  The home is a very lovely place easily walkable to Golden Gate Park/the ocean and it's extremely quick and easy to grab a short Lyft or Uber ride to more ""central"" locations in the city.

Highly recommend!"
1110346,290537984,2018-07-14,17860979,Ipek,It was just lovely to stay at Stella’s home. Stella is a wonderful lady her home is beautiful and peaceful and her dog Bruno is such a cutie. From the very beginning to the end of my stay Stella was very welcoming helpful and friendly. A very intelligent and caring person. Loved our chats and discussions on life. Whenever I need any help she was there and even at the times that I was busy working and not eating during the day she prepared sandwiches for me. I loved the breakfasts and especially her mom’s homemade cherry jam was my favorite. The room had everything that one can ask for… extra blankets heaters chocolates water books to enjoy and a lot more that I cannot count. It was the same for the bathroom spacious sparkling clean and had everything that you can ask for. The room is looking to a beautiful garden. The home is at a great location safe and within walking distance to many attractive places. Last but not the least I loved her dog Bruno he is very well behaved and full of love. Going to miss them…
2026910,26351534,2015-02-10,13749295,Jo,"I visited Bree's home for 10 days with my two best friends and had an incredible experience from beginning to end.  

This lovely Victorian-yet-modern home has all the essentials including soaps clean towels and reliable Wi-Fi but Bree also includes amenities that go above and beyond such as wonderful robes fresh fruit beautiful sheets lovely art soft blankets local maps regional food magazines postcards and stamps baking supplies a fine espresso machine slippers gorgeous glassware plenty of pots and pans an impressive (and fast) washer and dryer a hair dryer nice shampoo an iron and ironing board a clothing steamer board games great books and umbrellas.  As a host Bree is available to meet any need or question.

Also what struck me immediately about Bree's home was the level of cleanliness.  Every surface was scrubbed clean the sheets and towels were noticeably fresh the glassware and silverware were gleaming and the windows were spotless.  The bathtub is large and deep.  Staying here was a truly luxurious experience and I can't wait to come back.  

We would recommend this home for anyone seeking a serene getaway as well as friends and family looking to bond and reconnect or anyone needing a nice work-from-home day."
10379560,304033677,2018-08-08,21647928,Rebecca,"Felicia's place was very good! She is absolutely responsive if questions or problems. We didn't had the chance to see her cause a delay with our flight.
The place is a bit a far from SF Downtown and all other places of interest in the city but easy access via Lyft (or Uber). I think there's also a bus nearby (we always took a Lyft).
I recommend. Thank you Felicia! "
22619139,241340683,2018-03-08,113588913,Michele,The king size bed was very comfortable. Very nice bathroom.  Very clean.  I would   definitely come again. Overall a very nice stay.
488297,202074614,2017-10-09,127728962,Bruce,This property is elegant and very comfortable while providing a lot of light and a beautiful view of San Francisco. The owner Craig was accommodating and a pleasure to talk with.
1588695,8490007,2013-11-02,6513281,Pascal-Louis,Beautiful apartment decorated with great style in one of the most beautiful location SF has to offer. Sergio was a wonderful host and I left with a new friend. Can't wait to be back.
728585,487191178,2019-07-13,41081179,Bet,Estuvimos 4 noches después de 3 semanas de vacaciones  localización bastante buena cerca del aeropuerto (20 minutos)  muy cerca de Castro street.  Doug y su mujer super amables estuvieron allí para check in y check out. Compartimos en jardín en varias ocasiones el jardín precioso.  Guardamos un buen recuerdo de nuestra estancia en el cottage. Hasta pronto

16256385,464083724,2019-06-04,164148847,Lauren,We loved staying at Freddi’s place! The house was very charming and clean and the neighborhood was artistic and down to earth with lots of cafes and shops (great for sipping a coffee and people watching). Both Freddi and other guests  were friendly and welcoming and contributed to a really authentic experience of San Francisco. Thanks for having us and I hope we can come back soon :)
17444964,293178785,2018-07-19,189437111,Sanghyun,Exactly as desribed in the host’s text and also photos.

Ps go to Philz Coffee for breakfast."

We wish we were able to stay longer so we could have spent more time in the gorgeous yard! Totally spotless extremely comfortable I could go on and on. Thank you Marci and Evan!
982298,15965544,2014-07-19,16632568,Cheryl,George was a fabulous host with quick responses to my inquiries.  The vacation home was very beautiful in the perfect setting with everything we needed.  I would definitely rent this home again!!!  Thanks for a great vacation!

10729994,101873441,2016-09-15,16140056,Nick,The location and condition of the flat was great. Clean and well kept.
1433917,74560358,2016-05-15,29970398,Kate,This place is amazing. Absolutely as advertised. Such a convenient location and the space is clean comfortable and carries that SF vibe. The hosts are so welcoming and available as needed for info on the area and suggestions. I think my favorite thing about stay was how thoughtful this space is in how it's setup.  The apartment has so many amenities (like an espresso maker!) and has tons of SF resources. This place truly offers the comfort of home with some luxury and style. I would definitely stay here again. 
488297,40583444,2015-08-01,8217720,Thomas,"Beautiful home very thoroughly appointed kitchen the place was immaculately clean and a guaranteed parking spot is available. Gorgeous view of SF from the main balcony and there is also a second mini balcony which is quite nice too. Rooms clean and well decorated. Very nice base from which to explore SF. Definitely very highly recommended!
"
13762975,247795442,2018-03-29,15549444,Joanne,Gordon's apartment is in a great location and a great base to explore San Francisco! 10-15 minute walk to '24th street mission' bart which gives you access to all areas of SF. The area is close to 'mission area' which has really good food and bars! Close shop/coffee shops to apartment for something on your doorstep. Apartment has everything you need to do your own cooking breakfast/dinner etc. Gordon was quick to reply to any questions we had and even messaged us to let us know when events were on that we didn't know about - a picnic was happening in precsidio park on the Sunday with lots of food stalls and music etc. He also gave us great recommendations for continuing our trip down the coast to L.A. thanks Gordon!
24799389,445688235,2019-04-29,4385794,Jeff,I was amazed at the location of this beautiful home. It was a fabulous launching pad into the city no matter what I found myself wanting to do. This is one of the nicest homes I've been in San Francisco the amenities were fabulous. I felt like a king. This place is smack in the middle of the city. If you want to experience the real San Francisco this is the place for you. Two thumbs up.
19416507,240397478,2018-03-04,68532337,Joyce,Loved my stay at Cindy and Michelle's place; room was as described and proximity to beach and golden gate park was a plus. Although we didn't get a chance to meet they were quick to communicate and fix any issues that occurred.
4654737,95662672,2016-08-20,7263012,Kendra,We had a great stay and it was very convenient for us!  It's very spacious too :). There is a full kitchen if you prefer to cook or you can also easily access many restaurants on Chestnut.  I would stay again!
13169268,229057164,2018-01-21,41970562,Orin,Great location hot water comfortable bed.  They downgraded my room which was a bit annoying but compensated me for it.  I'd stay again.
30817227,431806172,2019-04-01,3485149,Kevin,"Super clean and comfortable.  Really nicely remodeled and the windows updates made it very quiet.
The location is great for a quick walk to some really incredible restaurants."
28589423,339645958,2018-10-21,119368102,Savannah,Really quiet and safe area located in a really great location that can get you wherever you want to go in a relatively short amount of time. I would definitely recommend and come back!
7933558,59698553,2016-01-14,25818785,Matt,Solomon was a thoughtful and considerate host and the unit was outstanding!  Big bedrooms comfortable beds and bedding and all the amenities you could possibly need for a short business trip or a longer family trip. A short (and inexpensive) uber ride to most areas in SFO you want to hang out and a number of restaurants within walking distance make this a great location. We were thrilled to have found Solomon's listing it delivered as advertised. 
12212013,402514816,2019-01-18,83258228,Bernadette,Nice apartment for a short stay. Bed is comfortable and the shower is hot with excellent pressure.  I liked having TV in the room to view from the bed.  Walking distance to restaurants.  A plus for me is that I felt very safe here.  I would use this rental again if I need another stay in SFO.
19922726,335296467,2018-10-11,126656625,Robert,A great beautifully appointed place to stay.  We slept like babies in total comfort could conveniently find public transportation (no car rental needed) great restaurants and a fun welcoming city awaited us.  Would definitely visit Maya and Todd again.
69549,19501950,2014-09-13,966905,Mika,The room was clean and I enjoyed having a private bathroom to myself. Maria was very responsive to my queries and was accommodating as well. The apartment was well connected by bus and was very close to the heart of the Mission District. I just wish there was a bath mat in the bathroom but apart from that everything was very smooth.
1920033,21466745,2014-10-18,20803540,Ron,"Stayed there two nights and would seriously consider it again should we return to the area.  My wife and I found the room to be exactly as advertised and pictured.  Having our own bath was definitely worth the few extra dollars.  Having the computer and printer available was also a ""plus"".  The room and bath were clean and while perhaps sparse the accommodations were clean comfortable and quiet.  Some may think it a little remote from the downtown area but that helped keep it quiet.  We had our own car so with GPS we found it easy to get anywhere we wanted."
208831,36279667,2015-06-27,28541138,Jan,"Peters home is perfectly located for all activities in San Francisco. The neighborhood is quiet and near little italy where you can have great dinner. Peter is a very handsome guy and has made a map for his guests with a ton of usefull information about what to do in SF. His dog is really cute and openminded towards ""his"" guests. All in all a perfect stay at a perfect location in a perfect town :)"
1223107,80023814,2016-06-15,2781237,Jeremy,The apartment was in a great location with a big private room with a very comfortable bed. Only issue I had was the wifi was a little flakey (right when I was streaming Game of Thrones!). I called my host and they called the cable company so everything was peachy.
12922728,128663787,2017-01-26,87840607,Jieun,Christie is a nice host! She always takes care of us and we could contact with her easily. When you have any problem she'll help you ASAP. I love everythihg during I stay there. Especially the house is cozy and comfortable. There is anything you want.  
856123,353378873,2018-11-27,222465382,Peng,The room is very clean and neat! Mark is very great!
10251,57531726,2015-12-27,1729379,Janie,We had a great stay at Roman & Sarah's over Christmas. Communication was easy Roman was there meet us and show us around. The apartment is beautiful with high ceilings and can get a bit chilly in the winter even though the heating works fine. Great kitchen to cook in. Only thing was that the sofa bed was an airbed and leaked air throughout the night. Mission is a great neighborhood to be in and it was easy to find parking in the side streets. Thanks for hosting us!
1344752,25501976,2015-01-18,24669307,Alexey,"The house was good though not very new one (many small things need reparation/ change); we were on business so were just sleeping there - the beds were excellent and bed clothes as well; this region of the city is very calm at night so you could sleep well; if you come for rest with family it may not be as good: only one real bath room and kitchen has no table besides a small ""bar"" one with 2 bar chairs - we were perfectly OK with this but take a note if you are coming for vacations. Probably the major objection is that the region around doesn't look very nice - quite dated houses all protected with fences (bars) we didn't expect to see that in SF. This is not a minus of the house though but of a surroundings. What to improve: make an easier access to the house (too complex system with the coded doors) + make extra keys. That's it thanks for hospitality

Thanks a lot!! Andrea."
1615088,535179015,2019-09-23,71353911,Tony,Arrived late after delayed flight but check in instructions clear and worked perfectly. Room clean and tidy. Great friendly hosts. Made us very welcome. Free use of washing machine and dryer very useful. Invited us to neighbourhood picnic on the Sunday afternoon in Alamo Square. Location great for Alamo Square and restaurants. Further to Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square but we enjoy walking so no problem for us. Would definitely recommend
2400409,245316990,2018-03-21,3417374,Deane,Very easy and flexible check-in process. Great amenities great communication and quiet location. Parking was always available right out front which was really important when driving with a toddler. The bed was extremely comfortable; I haven't slept that well in years! I highly recommend Eric's place if you are visiting SF.
21298312,548460929,2019-10-17,32437681,Nick,Jonathan was super attentive and welcoming and his place was comfortable for my wife myself and our dog. It was full of character and close to lots of places and the muni.
833149,72049292,2016-04-30,5701666,Tom,Michael met us at arrival and explained in detail the workings of the apartment. Very helpful.
213532,39494951,2015-07-24,33444188,John, Visiting the Haight is an experience in itself.  This room very definitely picks up the local flavor.  Room 4 is at the top of a lot of steep steps but that is typical of any of the beautiful San Francisco painted ladies. Fortunately for me (I have a bad knee)  the man who cleans the rooms carried our bags up and didn't want the tip I forced on him.  Josh himself carried them down for us.  When all is said and done you will remember your Haight Ashbury exerience for a long time.  Thanks Josh.
6600081,430083942,2019-03-29,233939216,Matthew,Lovely place very clean and comfortable. Great location the quieter end of mission but still a lot happening. Thanks Del.
25662,258189,2011-05-10,465699,Michelle,"We had a fantastic time staying in Gayle & Paul's studio apartment. The apartment is in a great location in an area we would have never seen if staying in a hotel with great little restaurants and quite a village like feeling. Good transport into town and the apartment had everything we needed for our 5 night stay.  Gayle even lent us a phone to make local calls as our Australian mobile wouldn't work in the US. 

The bed is one of the comfiest we slept in on our trip away and Gayle and Paul helped us with everything from restaurant recommendations to booking a hire car for our trip to Yosemite.

Highly recommend. Also recommend pretty much all of the restaurants and diners in the Protrero Hill area. "
9296524,224895457,2018-01-04,107159167,Linda,Great place. Very comfortable. Beautiful view from the deck. Friendly host. Very clean. Loved it. Would definitely stay again.
16797018,556128293,2019-10-28,257582703,Lindsey,Sarah and Pankaj were super wonderful hosts the house room and bathrooms are all sparkling clean. The design of the home works really well as a collection of private rooms that share bathrooms a full kitchen and recreational space. The hosts live on the top floor and their guests share the other two floors. Any amenity you can think of was provided by the hosts (breakfast refreshments towels toiletries and much more). The location is really great - quiet street and fairly close to public transportation and the Design District the Mission District and the airport. Had a really great time here!
909063,133787365,2017-02-24,78254312,Sarah,Great location well appointed room and very considerate and helpful hosts. 
515430,164330711,2017-06-27,8310257,Salma,"I booked Christa's place for my family friends who were visiting from the east coast. I really like the location it is far enough from the downtown craziness but still accessible to Muni and restaurants and shops. 
The place was cozy and small like the pictures and there is a nice patio"
23732691,364953908,2018-12-31,35447153,Praowpan,Helen’s house is one of the best place in SF. Room is spacious and she is very helpful to all guests.
213532,5252475,2013-06-20,6897021,Luanne,The location was great.  The room was clean and lovely.  A great experience.  Id recommend for sure.
31209988,417016470,2019-02-25,22407864,Jean,Great spot so close to Ocean Beach. Comfortable bed and sparkling clean. Plenty of space for a couple. Garage parking was a bonus. Nice patio space. Dana very easy to communicate with and she caught us before we left town to let us know we had left an item behind. Hope to stay again!
18737830,190263659,2017-09-03,229364,Will,"Stayed at Owen's place over the weekend. It's located in the middle of the Mission District which is a great place for shops food and bars. You won't go five minutes without finding a cool shop or something great to eat.
One huge perk is the parking. Driving up from LA there's always other things to consider like parking and location depending on where you stay in the city. Having free parking and a place to park your car is a definite plus that you shouldn't miss out on. 
Owen is also very supportive communicative and easy to talk to. We got in pretty late on our arrival day but had no problems meeting up with him to check-in. He's easy going and knowledgeable about the area.
Would like to stay there again if I had the chance or any other future visits to SF!"
14761638,187271949,2017-08-26,147685911,Sonja,The room was very clean and the beds were really fine. It was just a little bit loud because the leaky windows. But I think that is maybe normal in San Francisco. The Bathroom is shared by other people of the house. It feels more like a hostel but it was okay. We had a good night. If you can't sleep with noise from the street you will have a problem. For us everything was fine and we could also check in later without April which was very important for us.
3182798,246618799,2018-03-25,42364682,Karen,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 6 nights. On arrival we were met by Emily who was lovely and ran us through all the safety bits of staying on a boat then gave us a tour! The location was a priority for us and you won’t be disappointed. Pier 39 is a central tourist spot with lots of restaurants shops and the sea lions won’t disappoint either but surprisingly it’s not noisy when you’re on the boat as it’s far enough away from the main tourist area! The boat is basic but comfortable! Towels are provided and replaced as needed! There are lots of blankets on the beds because at night it can get cold! Not sure if duvets would be better? 

Unfortunately for us the weather was awful for the first 2days as it rained non stop but we still went out and made the most of it (being from the UK we’re used to constant rain)! It rained to the point that one night we sprung a tiny leak....I got in touch with Edward and it was fixed immediately. Communication was great and if we ever needed anything it was sorted as soon as possible.

Now if you’ve never stayed on a boat before or never been camping then I’m not sure this is for you. You get gently swayed to sleep at night! The beds and toilets are small...but.... it’s a boat! It can also get a bit smelly from the toilets! Also you can’t shower on the boat but to be honest that wasn’t an issue at all as the shower area is in close proximityprivate very clean and can only be accessed with a key!.

My only disappointment is lack of WiFi but you can get that in the shower area. 

All in all it was a great experience for us and would definitely do it again! Edward and Emily were great hosts!"
647360,206101756,2017-10-23,6217334,Mark,"Eric and Peter were great hosts!
The place was stylish and comfortable. They made our stay very easy and stress free. 
Highly recommended!"
21396964,326181500,2018-09-21,71779195,Thomas,"The room is small but clean and well located few meters from métro line M which will ride you to the city center from 30 to 45 minutes.

We did not seen Joseph but communication went well by messages he is reactive and you can easily check in and check out even if he is not available.

Room can be noisy since we have hear people talking and walking from the upper appartment.

To sum up it is a convenient place to spend few days in San Francisco for an affordable price regarding to the other rental locations."
8955959,484436332,2019-07-08,61475882,Polyn,The room was as described except that there was no bedroom door lock. Another couple was staying in a nearby room and accidentally  walked into our room at midnight. The host apologized for not updating that fact about the lock. The cats were very friendly and rambunctious probably because their owners were out of town.
4464347,29270872,2015-04-06,26875863,Francisca,"Perfecta relación precio / calidad. Ideal para jóvenes. La atención del equipo es excelente. Todos muy atentos y el desayuno y la cena gratis algunos días de la semana funcionan bien. 
La ubicación es realmente muy buena para conocer la ciudad y hay muchos restoranes y bares interesantes a sólo un para de cuadras."

6749412,230969949,2018-01-29,466485,Nathan,We had a wonderful stay! The park across the street was perfect for our daughter and we really appreciated all of the tips on where else we could take her in the area.
16649876,277543925,2018-06-16,1428722,Parvati,Dawn's place was pure magic.  We loved the gardens the artwork & the books!   Plenty of space to unwind while still being in the city to explore.  Thanks for a great stay!
25749954,296863171,2018-07-26,125177782,Jacob,Jenny's place was wonderful! It was right across the street from Golden Gate Park and six blocks from the Pacific Ocean!  Parking is a little easier on that side of town. (I didn't say easy Its San Fran). The bed is comfy and the bathroom is functional.  It's a shared bathroom.  It was a great find. I had a wonderful time. 
13735664,271214179,2018-05-31,1850372,Shaun,"The best! 
Undoubtedly and without reservation Linda and her family offer the most incredible generous hospitality.
Their thoughtful attention to detail and genuine caring make these the Jedi Masters of AirBnB.
Believe all the good things every reviewer has already written about their experiences."

191632,86293105,2016-07-15,54993812,Luisa,My husband and I spent three nights here during our first San Francisco visit and had a wonderful time. We arrived very late our first night and appreciated how easy Maria made it for us to get the key and get settled in. The room was clean and cozy and had everything we needed during our stay. It also felt very private and we rarely heard the neighbors above. Maria was kind enough to provide recommendations when we reached out to her and was very easy to communicate with. I also appreciated the small details like the chalkboards and guidebooks which gave it a personal feel. Thank you for hosting us Maria!
28360154,430504652,2019-03-30,73975437,Elaina,Gilles and Keady’s place is sparkling clean and beautiful decorated! We arrived in town a little before our check in time. I had sent them a message that we were headed that way and would find something to do in the neighborhood until then but they had the place ready for us early and Gilles was there to great us and welcome us in! Our stay was perfect the view was beautiful and the memory foam mattress was so comfy!
13149975,122465444,2016-12-23,3417139,David,Drew's Condo is very nice and very spacious.   It was located in a very residential area so it is very quiet at night as well.   Walking distance to Golden Gate Park.   I would definitely stay here again.
2123469,106756831,2016-10-07,76909201,Leo,It was nice experience staying with Viviane and Milo for 3 nights. Viviane helped us to pick up one luggage when we arrived as we have 3 heavy luggages Viviane is a kind lady she makes me feeling like at home I used her market card for shopping the safe way market is so close to the house very very convenient we cook for our breakfast  and drink night time all stuffs bought from safe way!!! Milo is a good boy and my daughter had good time playing with him! The neighborhood is very safe and it is good location to all sight seeing in downtown!
2178509,47343303,2015-09-18,18742716,Hossein,Gregg was a wonderful host and made us want to come back again. The house is beautiful and incredibly peaceful. We had a great time.
10427768,76647991,2016-05-28,71837796,Daena Marissa,Loved staying with Meg and Rebecca. You know how some homes are just so cosy and inviting? -- this was one of them! Public transportation is very accessible and they are some neat restaurants shops close by if you choose to stay close to the area. Meg wasn't around when we arrived but she made sure someone was around to greet us and pass us our keys. Very pleasant stay would totally recommend!

The studio is nice. It’s out of the way but everything is within walking distance. It’s perfect for 1-2 people.

Don’t miss this place!"
14125,61714008,2016-02-07,56862265,Sally,Olivia and her family were very welcoming - even inviting us to a party they were having in the gallery under the apartment.  Apartment was light and airy with interesting art work. Neighborhood has lots of restaurants and bars close by. 
24000340,499620169,2019-07-31,70086915,Louie,Really cute place and a super close hike to bernal hill! Room gets super bright in the morning with the giant window near the roof but so it’s so nice to watch the clouds pass by through it. Definitely a place for a cat lover
937842,12914509,2014-05-14,9679368,Julie,"We had a wonderful week and the place was fantastic. Perfect for 6 of us!  The hosts were great and provided  us with many suggestions of things to do and where to eat. I highly recommend staying here.

2455325,73751025,2016-05-09,62833752,James,This property was great.  It was just as pictured and advertised.  We had a seemless checkin and checkout.  Miriam was very helpful and very responsive anytime we had questions.  The place was good sized and in a good location.  We have been coming to SF for over 20 years and usually stay right downtown this was a much better place to get out of all that confusion.  You are about 15-20 minutes from Union Square Wharf Golden Gate Bridge etc. You can Uber Lyft or take one of the many frequent buses that come right by the house. The area around the house is great for walking ( all flat) and you are close to Presidio Park and not to far from Golden Gate Park. If you are a runner this is a perfect area for that.  We had my in- laws who are elderly and they walked every day.  There are TONS of bars restaurants cafe's and shops within 1 block.  I would highly suggest this place.
3311711,296857060,2018-07-26,31328804,Sam,Rye and Robin are very accommodating friendly and welcoming hosts. Their dog olive is also very sweet. Accommodation was great. Clean tidy spacious and comfortable. Would highly reccomend staying here for exploring San Francisco

25950417,329803519,2018-09-29,192935650,Gregory,Helen’s place was very clean and comfortable.  Felt like a real home that was very welcoming.  Highly recommend this place if you are in the area.
41423,349190,2011-07-03,486159,Ariane,We had a great stay at Carrie's Cottage it was clean and comfortable. Carrie was easily reachable by phone and she kindly answered any questions we had. We highly enjoyed the really near Farmer's Market and its fresh organic products.
14386727,403782803,2019-01-21,112966489,Josh,"Sketchy neighborhood.
Convenient to getting downtown and the airport.
You'll be in close quarters with thin walls to other airbnb'ers. Our neighbors woke us up one morning talking at 5am.
Sean and Vanessa responded promptly to all communication."
54634,278807257,2018-06-18,7729356,Marko,"We live near by and so we rented the studio for family (a couple) that was visiting for a few weeks. The studio was perfect for that.  

It's a cozy simple old SF style studio. It was clean and exactly as described and pictured. Bed was comfortable water pressure good and internet fast. 

If planning to walk keep in mind that the studio is located near the very top of Pacific Heights which may be challenging if you're not in shape. That said it's one of the nicest neighborhoods in SF right next to Lafayette park and walking distance to four shopping&restaurant neighborhoods -- Nob Hill Fillmore St Cow Hollow/Union St and Marina/Chestnut St.

Jay was flexible and very responsive before as well as throughout the stay (we did run into an issue that she resolved very promptly which was much appreciated).

Overall a great option for a longer stay in this area."
17318005,210905033,2017-11-11,92775794,Mathieu,Susan was VERY accommodating and my employees had a blast staying at her place. I would DEFINITELY recommend doing business with her.
664307,43478292,2015-08-20,2867463,Stefan,"My daugter (16) and me travelled for  6 days to SF. Everything was exactly as described. Geoff and his family were very friendly and helpful no question was left unanswered.
The neigborhood is very nice a lot of restaurants nearby and it felt always safe. Buses and the next BART station can be reached within minutes. No problem to explore SF from here.
After 2 days of our stay it happenend that something in our room needed to be repaired. Geoff was so generous to let us use his house (while he was on vacation) with no extra fee. Thanks Geoff that you trusted us !
If we ever come back to SF we will use Geoffs room again. We recommend this place definetely."
20695687,244543669,2018-03-18,2684369,Jordon,Tyler’s place reminds me that not all 5 star reviews are made equal. Tyler’s home was in a great location and was amazing for a weekend trip to the city. The amenities were just as good if not better than at a hotel. I would definitely recommend Tyler’s Airbnb to my friends and others.
21161595,222082168,2017-12-28,163476439,Kary,Claudia was very welcoming and the appliances were first class. There is a beautiful shower. The unit while small is very comfortable.

5918090,135176970,2017-03-03,43049718,Lauren,Had the greatest week at Dave's place. The house is beautiful and bright spacious deck and lush garden in the backyard. Neighbourhood is quiet with grocery stores/coffee shops within walking distance. A 10 minute walk to BART. Had no issues at all Dave was the perfect air bnb host. Would highly recommend this gorgeous home! 
12954602,367409790,2019-01-04,232688356,Sandeepan,My stay at this place was really comfortable. The space is stylish and very clean.

166199,96859922,2016-08-24,68741759,Yuanyuan,This place is really well located. There're restaurants and grocery markets nearby. I like the garden. The plants are beautiful. And I'm very happy to live here without carrying a key. What I have to do is just remembering a code which is pretty easy and convenient. The neighbors are warm-hearted.

252867,305112700,2018-08-10,55466066,Natalia,Great location about a 5-10 minute drive from AT&T Park 20 minutes from the Exploritarium.  We used our car more than public transportation so we are not sure how the Hill would work with the Bus or Bart.   The place is two levels and we mostly used the upper level.  Our twins used the bunk beds and the main bed was very comfortable.   THanks  for being great hosts!

23054267,318886493,2018-09-04,63104418,Asad,Spacious AVA lobby lounge with plenty of power plugs if you want to wait before check in and free wifi if you're coming in without data. Internet in the apartment unit was very fast as well. Smart TV with Netflix. The most fully equipped kitchen I've ever seen in all of my Airbnb experience so far! The sofa in the living room is amazing...they are so comfy! There is a Walgreens across the street if you need to do some quick grocery shopping but there are plenty of other restaurant options within walking distance. Overall an amazing place to stay in SF!
5591544,507618806,2019-08-11,21738240,Samantha,Chris was a great host! Beautiful apartment located in a central area and a vibrant neighborhood with plenty to do around. Highly recommend staying here if you are doing a trip to SF!
2316478,28383551,2015-03-23,26011911,Katie,The beach cottage was exactly what we hoped for!  There was plenty of space to spread out during our 8-night stay for work and fun in San Francisco.  We enjoyed walking in the park on the beach and down Balboa for dinner.  The parking was easy the kitchen was well-equipped bathroom was clean and fresh and the beds were comfortable.  We liked eating breakfast in the kitchen and enjoying the view down to the ocean too.  Communication leading up to our stay was excellent.  We hope to visit again someday!
2166428,43766409,2015-08-22,19290515,Kelly,The apartment was just as we expected; beautifully decorated perfect location clean & accommodating. Tisa was easy to reach and very responsive. It couldn't have been a smoother experience!

35472694,569498101,2019-11-26,16006671,Martin Fox,We had a fabulous stay in Yuma’s very comfortable apartment. Extra pull out beds gave us lots of flexibility in sleeping arrangements. Walking to Salvadoran coffee Safeway and fruit stands was a treat. Yum I set us up with a well stocked pantry of coffee tea and many snacks. Nice TV complete with Netflix. Quick drive into the city. Comfortable beds in nicely laid out bedrooms all very clean and welcoming. Yumi’s hospitality was the icing on the cake.

(I'm not good at English speaking/writing so anything that may sound harsh or just so-so is totally un-intended!)

Billy & John are obviously AirBnB-ing (can we say that?) because they love it. They are very warm and considerate. Everything is done so that you can just relax... and appreciate the huge collection of paintings drawings photos (umbrellas!) art books! The house by itself is art. They are also ideally located near different places but in a calm and restful location. 

In a few words I will come back when I'm in SF!"
18757990,194066967,2017-09-15,105118568,Peter,Clean and recently renovated unit. Impressive amount of tech throughout: light fixtures power window shades steam shower etc.  Would definitely stay again. Aaron was super helpful coordinating parking arrangements for our stay as well and always available for other questions too. Thank you!
9051149,319559027,2018-09-06,33065477,Casey,A great relaxing spot for a solo traveler. Really enjoyed catching up on some rest here and close to a lot of good stuff as well.
22814781,466951170,2019-06-09,104351368,Erick,Nick's place is beautifully decorated. In a great and safe location. Loved our stay. Would definitely stay again when we are back in SF area.

323635,195298921,2017-09-18,130554553,Lukáš,Exactly what I expect Mukt is very kind and nice person. Safety street and near to the house is bus stop. Great...
3257979,313662603,2018-08-25,171223222,Rachael,Robert is an amazing host! He will help you out wherever u need. His place is exactly as described absolutely no issues!
13652971,89655632,2016-07-29,18232560,Sirius Hang,David is friendly and has a really beautiful home. He was kind enough to pick me up from the airport late night. And there was no hassle check in and get settled. There was a smart key system in the property that was easy for guest to have access in and out any time. All the guests are pretty awesome and Bruce is a great dog. Although I only stayed for one night but that was a great experience I wish I could have stayed longer!
720811,21776902,2014-10-24,97118,Alex,We really like the Richmond area. Parking is not as difficult as in some other areas and there are lots of very interesting Asian markets and restaurants including our favorite dim sum place: the Hong Kong Lounge on Geary. Ron and Cherie's apt was very well located w many convenient bus lines. The bedroom was amazingly quiet. The bed and couch are very comfortable. Only drawbacks were the step down to the bathroom which is hard to get used to and no microwave which is even harder to get used to! Communication with our hosts was excellent. We only got to meet Cherie for about 2 seconds as she rushed off with her two youngsters but she was very friendly! Overall we would recommend this apartment for your SF stay.
9295965,323097869,2018-09-14,3752616,Zachary,A nice room in a good neighborhood. The room is small but there's enough in Japantown that it's not a problem. It's on a quaint street a block or two away from nice restaurants shopping and cafes.
865873,105712343,2016-10-02,1922099,Oksana,I enjoyed staying at Lenza's place! Super comfortable spacious has everything I would need. The bathroom is amazing incredibly big and  with huge mirrors. The location is great as well just in the middle of everything. I haven't had a chance to meet Lenza in person but our communication went well he was always available to reply any questions. 
9752333,511765419,2019-08-17,16618008,Zenia,"Communication and check in were great. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The description of the the unit is accurate. When other travelers have used the words ""stunning"" and ""amazing"" I may have been expecting a bit more. It is cozy and comfortable but definitely shows a little wear and tear and some unexpected unfinished attributes such as ceiling wiring that is uncovered (though high up and not an apparent danger) and an entry way that is oddly configured and unfinished. All that being said it is an excellent value for the area!"
5632452,420792294,2019-03-07,152470831,Quincy,I enjoyed my time at llya’s .
5196070,36291523,2015-06-27,24096254,Karan,The room was clean comfortable and quiet. Annie was there to welcome us and prompt responded to messages on the AirBnB app. She was very kind and helped with storing luggage post check out. Public transport is available very close to her house. All in all a good accommodation and would surely book again.

288213,128676108,2017-01-26,955959,Karen,The apartment was really perfect. I was working in San Mateo and wanted to stay in the city--a very short walk to Caltrain and a bunch of cool restaurants / bars / coffee shops. Also super comfy clean and exactly what you want in an AirBnB. I'll definitely be back.

4890230,303146267,2018-08-06,198714570,Wendy,"A great hostel for solo travelers and groups travelers. The staff are very friendly.  Check-in and check out are very flexible but let them know in advance. I was also able to store my stuff in another locker after my check out time. There's no air conditioning but it doesn't get too hot at least in my opinion well depends on the weather haha. I recommend bringing your own pair of slippers/sandals if you do not want to walk barefoot on the rug which everyone walk in and out off. There are activities offered every night. Free breakfast. Location is great and within short travel distance of the bay area. I booked through airbnb so any questions that I had they were all answered within a very reasonable time frame. Bathrooms were clean and the kitchen is very dynamic. 

Enjoy your stay. "
12511225,314431652,2018-08-26,126660073,Dawn,Such a lovely room so modern and comfortable. So clean very happy with our stay. Location was also ideal within walking distance to the piers didn’t need to take any transport while on our stay. Didn’t get around to trying the food but looked great. 
18916029,203871246,2017-10-15,12031224,Adalberto,Very unique place to stay! The location was great and the feel the place gives you fits perfect with the City!
7022309,490537560,2019-07-18,34901597,Anastasia,Beth is a great host and the place is a real home far from home. Everything is clean  the room is beautiful and the bed is comfortable in the kitchen you can find all the equipment that you need. The area is absolutely safe which is important in SF.  Beth is very hospital - she even prepared the room before check in because I came early and wanted to leave my luggage. It was a real pleasure to stay here.
63247,131908255,2017-02-14,3503527,Amanda,Anne couldn't have done a more accurate job depicting her little apartment. My boyfriend and I came hoping for a little home away from home and this little studio fit the bill. The street is relatively quiet near BART shops and restaurants and the apartment had everything we needed. Can't wait to stay here again!
8904047,222827277,2017-12-30,36108074,Matthew,Lovely little flat on a surprisingly quiet street in the heart of the mission
4617719,480466191,2019-07-02,120275764,Kevin,Garland is a super host! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at his place. The check in process was very smooth. The property was very clean and is located close to several public bus (MUNI) stops and a grocery store. The breakfast items provided were great and he also provided some snacks which were also appreciated. We would definitely stay at Garland’s place again!
33365567,505786043,2019-08-09,15792437,Loree,Nancy’s home in Cole Valley was the perfect place for our quick trip to San Francisco. Though Nancy ended up not being at home during our stay she did an amazing job staying in touch. We loved the location and the cozy authentic style of the apartment. Nancy’s home was clean quiet and cute. We would definitely stay here again!
4902565,132066938,2017-02-15,50263704,Alana,"The room and bedding were clean and comfortable. Owner communication was good through out the stay however never met him.

The neighbourhood is ""colourful"" and not entirely safe. I would recommend googling ""Tenderloin safety"" or asking someone about the area before booking in. It was fine for my husband and I as we have travelled extensively but must people I know would not feel safe there."
20367610,265933189,2018-05-18,48114796,Rachel,Amazing place! Stay here if you get the chance. The place was extremely clean and updated with modern finishes. It was centrally located so it did not take us long to get anywhere. The street we stayed on is super quiet but still close to everything we needed. We were also able to park for free on the street right outside. Je & Derren greeted us when we checked in showed us around and made themselves available to us during our stay. Their guidebook and tips were a great touch as we used them to find places to eat. Overall great stay!
14773919,446957219,2019-05-02,215303220,Patrick,One of the best experiences I have had staying in an Airbnb. The location hosts amenities and the view make it a wonderful stay. Terry goes out of his to make you feel welcome. Not far away is the top of Mt Davidson great way to see most of the city when you first arrive. Highly recommended
208831,174692846,2017-07-26,62691362,Wallace,"The location is the standout thing we loved!
The bathroom was very compact and the steps between the bedroom level and the living room level are a bit high but that only adds to the character of the place.
We loved it!"
4533652,32636594,2015-05-19,23510691,Racquel,The place was so cute! The perfect place for our stay! Gorgeous view fireplace and an awesome bathroom with huge tub! Thank so much Cc!
148559,3188975,2012-12-30,3737684,Larry,Nice place in a great location. We came to SF from the east coast to visit family during the holidays. Instead of shuffling from family house to family house we decided to use Steven's place as a base. Couldn't have worked out better. Our two kids enjoyed the bunk beds and the hammock! My wife and I the heated bathroom. Good location - near a Safeway and plenty of restaurants and shops. Steven mailed us a list of places and his take on each one. Nice neighbors and a garage to boot!
4663060,81355695,2016-06-22,64399604,Jane,The neighborhood is very nice safe and quiet. The public transportation takes getting use to if you do not typically do that where you live. The app called swiftly will help greatly! It took about an hour to get to the locations we wanted using the bus subway etc. we thought it would be somewhat faster so plan ahead! The room was much larger than we expected! We loved the living space and bed. It is below the owners floor and if they are home you may hear noise from above so expect that when booking. Good communication and easy access to the room plus easy parking!
21583195,322310294,2018-09-12,172756161,Rob,Comfortable stay with good breakfast close to bus route and easy to get around once you have mastered the MUNI
18507365,346177370,2018-11-07,54255500,A Jay,Great place in an awesome location in the Mission.
31124810,463160032,2019-06-02,167281545,Cara,Dongmei’s place was in a quite neighborhood and felt safe. The bed was comfy. The room was small but was all we needed considering we were only there to sleep for two nights. The other two rooms were rented out as well so that meant waiting to use the bathroom at times. It was a quick Uber ride (about $8 for two in an UberX) to the Mission District where we spent most of our time. I would definitely stay here again for short trips.
18012201,143870701,2017-04-13,370417,Jarrod,Great experience. Amazing value and you're so close to Golden Gate Park! Check in was easy the apartment was clean and the neighborhood is great. The N train is a block away for easy access to downtown or the beach. 
519796,160569645,2017-06-14,66334931,Grace,Suzette was a wonderful host! Great location and a beautiful apartment. Would recommend this Airbnb!! 
18904,46125338,2015-09-08,3066783,Diana,We really enjoyed our stay at Patrick's home! It was comfortable and quiet and also located in a great area. There's shopping transportation and terrific restaurants nearby. Loved walking through the peninsula which is just a short trip on foot. Patrick had great recommendations and was a terrific host. 
208831,5214405,2013-06-18,958946,Ethan,"We stayed here for the SF marathon this past weekend. Nothin I can say that hasn't already been said about this location and it's host! Peter was great kind always available if we needed anything and provided nice accommodations in the bustling tourist hub of San Fran. 

You are literally steps from amazing food coffee and popular destinations like Lombard St fishermans wharf etc.  Only negatives were that after 7+ hrs of driving we were told minutes from arrival that previous guests hadn't checked out yet (it was 3pm checkout was noon) and we would have to drive around more until Peter could change the sheets. We obliged (what else were we to do?) dropped off our luggage and bikes and spent the next few hours roaming exhausted around the area via car. Once we did get into the unit it had been cleaned up (though we wondered about the bathroom as it always had a mildew smell of wet towels/bathmats). I will also restate what others have mentioned: while this is a private downstairs area in Peter's personal residence - and we expected as much - noise can travel from upstairs pretty easily so bring ear plugs if you have an early morning (marathon) and need your beauty rest during a dinner party :) 

Regardless we would definitely consider coming back. I can imagine an extended stay in this unit is perfect as its affordable and has all the amenities. Peter (and Haley!) were very hospitable and again the location can't be beat. "
7073115,80065164,2016-06-16,29551929,Angela,Isaac was excellent at communicating to ensure that our stay went as smoothly as possible. The room was comfortable and it was so nice to have private entry. Overall a solid choice great location and wonderful host - would definitely stay again! 
15675892,226822387,2018-01-12,166882584,Megan,Cute quaint place. Super clean only downside was the window looked out into another window down into an alleyway BUT it was still a preferred place of stay and I would definitely come back!
1206184,487157475,2019-07-13,9021977,Georgina,Really great space in a great location! Lovely host as well will definitely be returning

11674758,479323476,2019-06-30,30811709,Alice,I had a good experience staying at Pete and Ivan's place.  Check-in was really easy the room was clean and close to some really cool spots in the Mission District.  The hosts were accommodating and allowed us to leave our suitcases for a few hours after check-out which I really appreciate.  Thanks Pete and Ivan!
1615158,17225619,2014-08-09,18011257,Aud,"Had a wonderful 3 1/2 day stay with Laura in Outer Sunset.  Her house is spotless and full of interesting artifacts from her travels.  Her guest room is on the lower level large and private with a separate entrance and attached bathroom.  We thought the shower was comfortable and roomy fantastic with the separate area for sink/mini-fridge. Someone previously complained about cell and wifi so thought I'd mention: cell coverage is fine no worse than anywhere else in the city.  Wifi isn't 5 bars in the guest room - probably bc it's downstairs (but it worked fine). 

Laura is personable and fun striking the perfect balance as a host. She made herself available but also respected our space. We felt welcome and at ease in her house for sure. She is knowledgeable about SF and gave us fantastic recommendations for dining walking hiking etc. tailoring them to our interests. The Outer Sunset neighborhood is walkable with restaurants and a wonderful co-op grocery just a couple blocks away on Judah street. Ocean Beach and Golden Gate Park are easy walks from her doorstep (both closer than we expected and quite nice).

PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION to Outer Sunset on the L line muni (a couple blocks to the closest stop) takes a while but we (Hidden by Airbnb) -mapped ahead of time and knew that. Plan an hour for the longest trips across the city (like to Pier 39). The L line is quirky but buses 71 on Morega and 29 on Sunset (barely a block away) were regular with much quicker rides to the BART or up through the eastern end of the park Haight Ashbury and across town. Most bus rides took from :30 to 1:15; we used the time to plan our day soak up the neighborhoods and enjoy the views! Coming home to Outer Sunset was incredibly relaxing and we felt safe both day and night :-) 

Anyone with a car is going to love the free parking spaces around Laura's home.  The same routes via car instead of public transport were quick and easy - think (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes.

Speaking of Laura even helped us out with car rental arrangements for our weekend trip up the coast and gave us great advice for avoiding festival traffic on our return before our flight out Sunday night. She was a fantastic host.  I'd recommend staying with her without hesitation.

La chambre est vraiment jolie  le lit parfaitement confortable !

1003756,351171674,2018-11-21,4153296,Fares,Josh is a great host and his place is my favorite in San Francisco! Highly recommend!
28189029,356277187,2018-12-07,29467498,Céline,Vladimir's place is gorgeous clean and in a great location. Breakfast was a really nice perk.
137546,7382142,2013-09-17,6255538,Emily,"Didn't get to meet Scott but did meet his roommate Juju. She was very sweet and gave us a great breakfast recommendation our first day which we frequented throughout our stay (Café St. Jorge). The house was clean and our room was very spacious. Parking was scarce but you can find a spot if you have a few minutes to hunt. You're just 2 blocks from the nearest transit stop which will take you just about everywhere you want to go in SF for a couple bucks. You can't beat the price of this place. Truly a gem!

My one small complaint was that the other guests had an infant whose crying kept us up late/woke us up early but this is not a reflection of the host or the accommodations. We would happily stay again. :)"
8472083,247814298,2018-03-29,23432225,Daniel,Very spacious modern and comfortable apartment 5min walk away from the water. Bina and her partner went above and beyond to help out or make me comfortable. Great value and comfort in the Marina. Lovely garden to have a cup of tea in too. Highly recommend.

The communication with Roberto was very good."

12151600,468543786,2019-06-12,108668682,Kim,Everything was great amazing view. Nice host easy check in even though we didn’t met Herbert everything worked easily Herbert gave us fantastic tips for going around by bus.
10427768,209204737,2017-11-04,5985986,Emily,Meg was a great host and gave me useful tips for my move to the area. The room is spacious and well-equipped even with chocolate! The apartment is in a centrally located neighborhood that is trendy and full of coffee shops and restaurants.
4638266,47390676,2015-09-18,27174934,Jim,"Nina was easy to communicate with before the visit and was even texting us advice on how to beat traffic as we were crossing the Golden Gate bridge and working our way to her place.  Her apartment is huge and full of fascinating evidence of her world travels.  The second floor apartment has an elevator for heavy luggage which was unexpectedly convenient.

The rented bedroom is not dedicated to visitors. There is closet space but we mostly lived out of our suitcases. That is certainly not unusual in an Airbnb rental.  The bed is a futon and was being replaced by a brand new and improved futon the day we left. Happily the old one had lots of length for my 6'5"" body. The bathroom was pristine looking like we might have been the first to use it.

The apartment is just south of Golden Gate Park in a wonderful part of the city loaded with quirky stores great ethnic restaurants convenient to museums public transit.  Quiet at night but lively and fun when you want it to be.

Nina is a perfect hostess loaded with advice about how to make the most of a visit to San Francisco.  She has an amazingly detailed knowledge of restaurants bus schedules local history etc.  She  even did a load of laundry for us let us share her breakfast loosened us up with wine and amazingly offered to drive us to the airport when our Uber driver temporarily seemed unable to accommodate us.

This is a friendly and hospitable place and we highly recommend it."
1724819,49318902,2015-10-03,36905783,Jun,Really nice view of this apartment. Natasha  welcomed us warmly and was always ready to help. Good experience in SF.

20331804,202994165,2017-10-13,41153829,Sebastian,Rob's Wohnung liegt in der Mission St die direkt durch Downtown San Francisco bis zum Embarcadero führt. Es gibt weniger Meter von der Wohnung einen Bus mit dem man ohne Umsteigen in 20 min dort ist. Die Wohnung selbst ist sehr groß und hat 2 Wohnzimmer ein Esszimmer sowie eine Küche und ein Bad. Alles ist sehr stilvoll fernöstlich dekoriert (Originale aus Myanmar hab ich mir sagen lassen). Das private Zimmer ist eher zweckmäßig gehalten und etwas klein was für mich jedoch kein Problem war. Alles war stets sauber und Rob kümmert sich sehr gut um seine Gäste (fragt ob alles OK ist und bietet Hilfe an). Ein Duschplan stellt sicher dass man morgens seine 30 min Zeit hat und keine Touren etc. verpasst. Alles in Allem hatte ich eine super Erfahrung mit dieser Unterkunft!
16351934,139303648,2017-03-24,36955470,Scott,Great place in Mission (near a park grocery store and several restaurants)!
14268636,461492374,2019-05-31,257172741,Eduardo,"Perfecto todo! La habitación es tal cual se describe. La ubicacion de la casa está cerca de todos los medios de transporte de SF. Si bien está un poco alejado del centro es bastante accesible para ir a todos lados!
Julian súper atento y da respuestas rápidas te da tu espacio y siempre está atento para lo que necesites.
100% recomendado!"

1615088,506572002,2019-08-10,40417224,Philipp,Everything was perfect at this apartment. Great location close to the painted ladies in a quiet area - but with a lot of bars supermarkets and restaurants just 200m away it was the perfect area for us to stay. The apartment itself had everything you could need and jack and Jason had an immediate answer to all our questions. We can only recommend this apartment to everyone!
15207940,316181591,2018-08-30,48114558,Paul,A great place to stay! Thank you

And the place looks even better than what you see in the pictures (very stylish!).  We appreciated her attention to detail to make sure we felt special during your stay.  Comfortable bed soft towels kitchenette area with small fridge microwave espresso machine utensils and a binder that had all the info you could want including places to visit drink and eat. My wife was very impressed with me for choosing Kelly's place!  If I come back to SF I'd love to stay there again.

15207940,266262496,2018-05-19,186533643,Ruchit,Ha and her brother were great hosts. They gave helpful tips on how to navigate and enjoy San Francisco. The house was cute cozy and very clean. The area of this place was just perfect - walking distance from many good eats on Ocean Avenue and very close to bus stops / Muni metro stops to help traverse the city. The neighborhood was decorated and quiet. Would definitely come again if we visit San Francisco again!
1807012,50508746,2015-10-12,2803657,Helen,Val and her place were both brilliant. My friend and I felt very welcome straight away and had lots of fun with Val. Her dog Lou is amazing so friendly and lovely- we fell in love with him. It's a great location for discovering the city with loads of awesome places on the doorstep and Val has put together a great guide to the city together. Would definitely recommend 
17812931,406722598,2019-01-30,3915977,MaryLou,Cozy and homey. Very friendly on site host. Great for friends/siblings traveling together. Don’t pass up on the breakfast. Excellent food and a great bargain.
258873,6612229,2013-08-19,6267189,Sylvain,Very good location for this place close to Little Italy China Town Coït Tower and Fisherman's Wharf. The hosts are very friendly they like to discuss and to give suggestions about what to do in the neighborhood. The room is convenient and clean and quiet with a nice view on the street and the Transamerica Tower.

16710475,199736815,2017-10-02,69335381,Abbi,Great comfortable and clean home. Hosts are very pleasant and accommodating. we recommend this listing very highly...
10835637,428283484,2019-03-24,118738418,Cindy,The house was conveniently close to public transportation.  I was out late one night after dinner and felt perfectly safe walking through the neighborhood.  The basket of maps and brochures for things to do was helpful.  The host also provided a notebook that was specific to the area with places to go and things to see.
71645,160821396,2017-06-15,769546,Susan,What a perfect place to stay while visiting San Francisco.  No car needed!  The bus is a short walk away and in less than 10 minutes you'll find yourself in the Mission.  The unit is private clean well stocked and faces a lovely courtyard.  Jeff couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating.  We'll definitely be back!
26169782,350230870,2018-11-18,48893094,Robert,We really enjoyed staying at Jacquelineluo's place! It was perfectly located within walking distance of Daly City BART had all of the amenities we needed and was very comfortable! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy SF for a weekend without having to stay right in the middle of it.
4902444,205248886,2017-10-21,99645402,Mary,Sarah's place has a very cool style to it. The people working there are friendly and accommodating. It's a very social hostel lots of opportunities to meet people. Great location.
21382398,234170759,2018-02-11,73832342,Brandon,What a great place to stay in SF. Good location with easy parking and some great local restaurants and coffee nearby. The accommodations were comfortable and we loved Mishka the cat. Super sweet.
19363609,203781969,2017-10-15,2224636,Janie,I really enjoyed my stay with Rich and Geoffrey! They were friendly and generous hosts and quick to respond to any of my questions. The room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. The location was also walking distance to the BART. I would definitely stay with them again when I return to SF!

Lit confortable et chambre spacieuse! il y a meme un grand coin cuisine bref tout ce qu'il faut pour séjourner quelques jours."
18904,513644373,2019-08-19,58406594,Nicolas,Patrick is a great communicator and was checking in with me frequently during the time of my reservation till my arrival. He was was concise and gave me all the information when I arrived. The space was clean and the shared space was very beautiful!
21281846,483732107,2019-07-07,125935887,Lucie,It was perfect !
10788469,482661889,2019-07-06,263871047,Kristen,6 women - 3 moms and 3 daughters stayed for 4 nights in this fantastic home.  There was plenty of space for all and the views were spectacular.  The neighborhood is quiet.  Thank goodness for the parking space in the driveway as we often returned too late for street parking.  Having your own vehicle is a big help as we weren't familiar with the public transportation and the hill to the house is very steep.  Getting in and out of the home was a breeze.  The instructions for the keys and the gate release were perfect - we didn't have any trouble.  The kitchen has everything you could want for preparing your own meals if you want.  Uber Eats delivers as well.  Note:  the coffee maker is a french press so be prepared.  The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms spacious.  James and Jonno were very responsive when we had questions.  All in all we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.  And as a side note I left something very valuable behind and Jonno went out of his way to arrange it to be mailed to me.  I will be forever grateful for his hospitality!
17812931,160153248,2017-06-12,84118412,Carole,"Le logement de Marie était parfait ! Elle nous a réservé un accueil chaleureux et on se sent comme à la maison.  Et le déjeuner est le meilleur que j'ai jamais eu dans un Airbnb ! Merci encore Marie !  Je vous recommande fortement cet endroit !

Near his house there are bars and some restaurant to eat Charlie can tell you where to go. Excellent place to stay ! 10/10."
2950592,490460542,2019-07-18,2033276,Brenda,This is a cosy well-located and spacious home for our family of five to meet up.  The kitchen is especially well-equipped the beds are wonderfully comfortable and the parking was much appreciated.  All in all a great home and area from which to be in San Francisco!
15330348,238975026,2018-02-27,5290016,Cecilia,I had a pleasant stay here  -- it was just  like a hotel room.  I wish I'd had more time to hang out in the gorgeous garden.  Stella changed the towels and emptied the trash for us during our stay which was much appreciated.
6301675,513567027,2019-08-19,247074959,L. Anne,We really wished we could have stayed longer at your place and were disappointed that various issues arose which complicated our ability to make full use of the amenities available at your place. Particularly nice was the swimming pool! And the neighbors were friendly and one could walk to nice restaurants and also to Whole Foods. Also we were able to get a pass and use Muni and Bart to get everywhere we wanted to go. Or to take an inexpensive Lyft or Uber when we felt too lazy to walk to transit or were in a hurry to get somewhere. Also close by is the fantastic shopping mall with everything in it including tasty and nutritious take out. Note there is even a UNIGLO nearby. We loved the neighborhood the convenience of not really needing the car that we brought and parked in the garage beneath the unit. The future is a society that does not need a car or can afford the new TESLA. Next time we visit we will be sure to leave the car at home!
1920033,95875110,2016-08-21,67278583,Mairead,This was my second time staying with Kevin and it was just as enjoyable an experience as the first. The room is clean spacious and in a quiet location. Kevin really does go out of his way to make you feel welcome - he provides food and snacks that guests can eat and was kind enough to recommend places of interest in the city. I would definitely recommend staying at Kevin's house. 
10035487,86388491,2016-07-16,3852251,Cindy,Great neighborhood and very happy with the location. Accommodating with our early arrival time--Thank you for the early check in!
7180020,56254292,2015-12-11,45025833,Jigar,Cleber Vera husband met me when I arrived there. He made me comfortable and walked me thru the house. House is very welcoming and it talks how lovable couple they are. All things are very well staged and all things you need away from you are available. Vera & Cleber thank you for making my stay so comfortable.  I love the token of love & remembrance you left for me.  It is very good. 
4902063,534595978,2019-09-22,244329606,Monica,it was great and clean thanks

2747383,221208579,2017-12-25,63757089,Françoise,Very nice place to stay. Every expected things are there closed from public transportation. Just 2 minutes walk to the see. Very quiet. We really loved to stay in the beach house. Brian was very reactive to answer and he proposed a huge list of addresses. I recommend his house. Philippe
9990609,109008756,2016-10-18,22012458,Payton,Super clean and easy to find place. Love the fact that there was safe easy parking as well. The neighborhood is very convenient. I didn't sleep well: the beds are extremely firm and there was an avid pianist and guitarist who seemed to prefer practicing early in the morning. Noise from the building does tend to carry in the apartment but I think that might change if and when more rugs/furniture are added. If those things won't bother you you'll enjoy this apartment very much. The host communicates very well and agreed to allow us to cancel because of my sleeping issues. 
16073836,349224043,2018-11-16,33760254,Olafur,great place host and location. sparkling clean
51557,111314098,2016-10-30,26081948,Alana,Len was such a great host! Super communicative and accommodating! He met my colleague at the apartment when he arrived to give him the check in info and directions around the area. I would love to book with Len again in the future. 
4948340,191712766,2017-09-08,42680709,Emilie & Yannick,Il y’a une place de parking mais plusieurs locataires donc il faut arriver au bon moment.
2188561,222424106,2017-12-29,157932687,Audilia,Great house with a great host.  Nina was accomodating and responded quickly to all of the questions.  The house was clean and checked all of our needs.  It has a parking space too!!  We have toddlers with us and she had books and toys for kids that were definitely a big plus.  We would definitely stay here again.
727866,465963580,2019-06-08,38283170,Remy,Kevin & Esther are simply the best hosts I've ever had. Welcoming friendly available and their location is great. Easy access to the city center using the Muni metro allows to enjoy the agitation of San Francisco during the day and relax feets in the ocean at night. There's everything you need in the appartement even some cookies when checking in ! :)
256176,82373629,2016-06-27,27001729,Katrina,This is my second stay at Eva's. It's perfect for one and well located. I like having the separate entrance and my own bathroom. It's very clean. It was a little loud for me from upstairs only because I was in bed early (before 9pm on friday). The noise wasn't late and if you are out and about in the city it won't be an issue for you. 
9882522,333760297,2018-10-07,207704671,Kun Hsing,"A good place!
It’s convenient to go to anywhere
The room also is clean and big"

12041223,345709894,2018-11-05,61887491,Heather,Michael and Nicole were lovely. Nicole greeted us warmly and saw to every need. The space was especially cozy and friendly. It was an amazing location just steps from lots of wonderful local cafes.
6045869,196037406,2017-09-21,106037338,Nate,2nd stay -- just as good as the first. Great location convenient and quiet enough for being able to sleep at night.
13265498,364521762,2018-12-30,124181702,Ammar,Very unsatisfied with the fact that untrue details of the room were provided when booking. When we complained completely no understanding and just pretended that it was completely normal

If you like cats there are 2 of them one is social and welcoming.

The neighborhood might cause concern for people not from a city.

I'd stay here again."
997382,8521656,2013-11-04,7451686,Alice,The room was tiny but good for one person. The house is pretty characteristic and in a great location!!
8287266,69410266,2016-04-11,82853,Andrew,We stayed at Alex and Daniel's Victorian house in the Castro for a week and we didn't get to meet them in person however they were both accessible to message any questions we had.  The room is exactly as it is described and is a quiet haven away from busy downtown and really close to local nightlife in the Castro. 
2058119,15681046,2014-07-14,15341261,Sol,"Although I couldn't meet Javi personally he took care of everything for us to enjoy our stay! His friend welcomed us when we arrived and he helped out with everything we needed.
Prior to our arrival I spoke a few times with Javi great feedback from him at any time. 

The house is great very spacious room and the location is just perfect. I loved the neighbourhood and how easy is to move around San Francisco from there. "
60365,28244646,2015-03-21,20577454,Krista-Lee,We arrived to the house with no issues finding it and were very happy the house ! Emilie went above and beyond was more than reasonable and great to deal with before and during our stay. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy a full house with lots of charactor lots of space and ammednities and a great place to relax after a day of sight seeing. Five stars from us and two thumbs up. Thank you emilie!! 
5884735,108845767,2016-10-17,28249178,Evgeniya,We had a great time staying at Mouwafac's place. It's a great location in a very safe clean and beautiful part of town. We did not have a car and it was very easy to travel by public transportation anywhere: the place is a straight shot by BART from the SFO airport. There are also several tram and bus stops within a block or two going to major city attractions. The location of the place allows for very inexpensive Uber rides as well. The place itself is very clean and modern.Thank you Mouwafac for a great SFO experience!
1183521,82637155,2016-06-28,33376258,Sarah,Charming apartment and rooms. My friend and I stayed here for two nights. The location was perfect. Truly one of the nicest airbnbs I've ever stayed at. Highly recommend.

12368621,312578064,2018-08-23,152506138,Mackenzie,This is one of my very favorite places to stay in San Francisco. It is beautiful clean private modern and comfortable. I love the neighborhood and surrounding areas. 
14990478,340994776,2018-10-25,55402935,Olivia,I can’t recommend this place enough! It was so clean and comfortable and thoughtfully put together. My husband and I felt right at home. It’s a convenient 20-30 minute Lyft to just about anywhere in the city and only 15 minutes to the airport. The garden is beautiful and a wonderful place to hang out after a day of sight-seeing! If we ever go back to SF we will definitely want to stay here again.
1992217,337842602,2018-10-17,14746851,Lena,Peter is a great host and we loved his place. We would stay here again!

Uncomplicated tidy nice neighbourhood.

5863674,132562168,2017-02-18,6838970,Brie,Beautiful and clean studio apartment with very friendly hosts & easy check-in/out. Lovely outdoor space with great views of the city. Not as centrally located as we had hoped  the neighborhood is very quiet and residential but we had a car and it was not a problem to park. 
15069107,319542630,2018-09-06,212901781,Andres,Clean place amazing location and great host. As a bonus the room is extremely dark once the lights are off and the doors are closed so it's easy to sleep well.
1615088,42726713,2015-08-15,20489829,Ian,"Jason and Jack were perfect hosts.  They waited up for my friend and me as we were on a late night flight from the East Coast.  

The room was perfect.  It came equipped with a coffee machine and a TV with Netflix and HBOGo.  It looked like it had been professionally cleaned.

This was my friend's first experience with AirBnB and he left impressed.  I didn't want to tell him that not all AirBnB's are this good.  I would definitely stay here again."
1633225,137652112,2017-03-16,119837242,Alexa,We loved our stay at Herbert's. Spacious room and spectacular view!

6132191,209731460,2017-11-05,9614242,Seetha,Very spacious well maintained apartment in a perfect central location. Walkable to restaurants shops and business meetings. Great kitchen and w/d.
10528294,321945669,2018-09-11,74461587,Sebastian,Very nice homey AirB&B with great cafes restaurants and bars in the area. Very friendly and welcoming hosts.
213532,17933079,2014-08-19,8641601,Melissa,"What a wonderful visit at Josh's lovely home!  I cannot say enough about how charming Room 4 is - the view the breeze the very comfortable bed even the cozy little breakfast nook with the en suite sink!  Josh was so accommodating to our plans: we had booked Room 4 for me and my husband over a weekend so we could move our two freshman sons into the dorms at University of San Francisco.  At the last minute we found out we couldn't get the boys into their rooms until first thing Saturday morning so where were they going to sleep Friday night?  We contacted Josh and he was good enough to allow the boys to rent another room for just Friday night.  A lifesaver!  We had a car and were worried about the legendary San Francisco parking but it ended up not being a problem at all.  We were able to find parking all 3 nights within one block of the house.  One night we even parked right in front.  Luckily you don't need a residential parking permit for parking within 1 block of the park. Josh has the whole house on a keyless system which works so well - no worries about keys ever!  My only word of caution (but no sacrifice of a star) is that there are many steep stairs to deal with - no fault of Josh's of course.  This is only relevent to someone with knee or back issues or traveling with a lot of heavy luggage...just a warning. The neighborhood is great with plenty of restaurants & coffee places within walking distance. Try Cha Cha Cha for dinner Stanza for coffee (incredible pastries) and it's worth the trip to go to Nob Hill to try breakfast at Mymy (1500 California).  
We'll stay here again.
Melissa & David"
21011508,434449406,2019-04-07,108370087,Lori,Our family had a wonderful stay at Marina and Michael's place.  The space is really beautiful very open and bright with wonderful personal touches and art throughout.  As a family with two very young children it is a rare treat to find a place that is both beautiful and also very kid friendly.  Marina and Michael very kindly provided our children with a basket of toys that kept our kids entertained throughout our visit and we also really enjoyed playing in the yard  just outside.  Other thoughtful features include free passes to the exploratorium and zoo (which we enjoyed) breakfast items and some delicious wine and chocolate.  We love the neighborhood - so convenient to the beach golden gate park and many other attractions without the noise and traffic of other areas in the city.  Overall a wonderful stay and we look forward to coming back in the future!
238190,18433231,2014-08-26,19540468,Jean-Louis,Bill was a very great host and offered us a great location in a warm environment.  Everything was excellent.  The only sad thing was that we had to sleep on an inflatable matress (still acceptable thought as we were burnt out at the end of our days).
8277718,506510167,2019-08-10,39061216,Trevor,Staying here was perfect in all regards. The room was very clean and all the furniture was new. Melanie and her family are so kind. They offered me tips on places to go and even offered to help out if I needed anything. They are truly kind hearted people who take pride and care about the stay. It's better than any hotel I've ever stayed in. I would highly recommend staying here! It was perfect! Melanie was very responsive and such a kind person. Thank you Melanie and your family for making me feel welcome and at home and for all of your kind gestures and help. This is truly a secret gem and I would highly recommend staying there! I arrived as a temporary guest and felt as though I left with new friends! Amazing!
16454916,313076197,2018-08-24,633092,Joan,"Maria's home is beyond amazing. It is set back off the road with it's own little rock garden / deck. The view from this home is outstanding and I couldn't wait to get ""home"" at night to enjoy the lights of San Francisco. this neighborhood is definitely one of the quieter neighborhoods of San Francisco and I loved the opportunity to ""get away"".
The house is IMMACULATE with plenty of space for a couple. Everything is super well thought out like a super groovy shower and great lighting throughout the house.
Maria communicated very well and provided a guidebook. "
9752333,250336867,2018-04-04,99635539,Franco,Peg and Jeff’s place is one of those “secret San Francisco finds.” With a backyard garden as beautiful as one would expect from a scene in Finding Netherland and a living space better lit by natural light than most NYC penthouses my girlfriend and I couldn’t have asked for a better place to spend our vacation (especially for the price!)
5944921,256486804,2018-04-22,34621512,Jing Yuan,Haitham is very helpful. Then place is clean and tidy and i would recommend anyone to stay here.
271602,135178885,2017-03-03,8656646,Guido,"Richard's place is perfect for anyone wanting to explore downtown San Francisco and/or especially for those attending a conference at Moscone Center which is only a 5-minute walk away. 

Located on a small side street in SoMa the apartment is super quiet for it's central location and even has a bit of a view of the downtown core. The place is small (not uncommonly or uncomfortably so for SF) but has everything you might need for your stay. 

I didn't meet Richard in person but he was always available to me and made sure everything went smoothly. I would definitely stay at Richard's place again. "
730045,12948621,2014-05-15,13221814,Lucile,"This is the perfect place to enjoy san francisco. Very nice neighbourhood with a lot of great restaurants and bars. Next to muni and bart. Very conveniant if you travel by plane. The studio is big and quiet.

She had a crib set up for the little one along with toys for the 2 and 6 year old.  Wine and beer chilled in the fridge for adults and a variety of breakfast foods available.  A fantastic modern clean home very well decorated and comfortable in a super neighborhood across the street from Golden Gate Park. Not a single complaint from anyone.  Large perfect space for us to celebrate Christmas in SF.
545685,12179127,2014-04-25,11719281,Georgia,"Linda's garden suite was absolutely perfect. The close proximity to the Golden Gate Park Geary St and transport was fantastic. Also the keyless entry was great too no need to worry about keys you just punched in the numbers! Linda was very accomodating letting us check in early with the suite ready and clean when we got there. We also opted for the aerobed to be made up and that was super comfy!
Thanks Linda for a wonderful stay in San Francisco we loved the city and part of that has to do with your Garden Suite!"
14775913,335273014,2018-10-11,47307975,Andreas,We had a great family vacation in the house of Voytek in San Francisco. Voytek is very nice and to communicate with him was very easy. We would recommend this house anytime.
2016198,181881186,2017-08-13,14822370,Axel,"The place is absolutely charming and well located. Between the bus and L Muni line it's really convenient to travel all around SF without a car. Char and Rus are really helpful and they gave us great advice about the neighbourhood which they know very well. Would totally recommend the place.
Thanks again guys."

12797906,96374561,2016-08-22,79403984,Howard,This property fit our needs perfectly. The two bedrooms were furnished with extremely comfortable bedding and ample closet space. The kitchen was perfectly sufficient for our needs plus a comfortable den for T.V. watching and relaxing together.  Bathrooms were nicely updated. We chose the location for its proximity to our daughter's  house just a few streets away. Parking was easy in this quiet residential Sunset neighborhood. The host and her property manager were very responsive with good communication from reservation confirmation to check-out. A truly positive experience
8336228,265331672,2018-05-16,6608751,Nick,Matthew and his family are wonderful host. They were welcoming helpful and allowed us to enjoy the space as though it were our own. We would definitely stay with them again.
9051149,179126605,2017-08-06,79863210,Jess,Our stay at Elmer's was fantastic. One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. Elmer (and London the Corgie) were very welcoming and accommodating. The room was very comfortable and Elmer goes above and beyond to provide everything you could possibly need. The bathrobes were a great touch too!
504146,69093377,2016-04-09,57797103,Jerry,We have only good things to say about Laura's rental.  Laura was very friendly and helpful.  The location of her studio could not have been better!  The space was pretty and had everything we needed for a delightful stay.  The patio was heavenly.  We would recommend this getaway to anyone.

27491792,418264972,2019-03-01,29111551,Michelle,Hanna’s apartment is spacious and immaculately clean.

442397,171753075,2017-07-18,17382283,Janette,Very nice new apartment.  It was nicely decorated quiet clean and roomy.  We were 4 adults and had plenty of personal space.  We loved the location just a block off the beach and half a block from public transportation.  The neighborhood was quiet and safe.  Just a couple blocks from Golden Gate Park and a few blocks from a large grocery store. We appreciated the use of the garage for a couple of days. Marianne was very prepared and made sure the our stay was good. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were very modern.  The apartment was everything Marianne said it was.  We loved the breakfast goods and snacks provided.  Everything in the apartment was just as shown.  The extra information on restaurants and public transportation was appreciated.  Would highly recommend this apartment!

We really enjoyed our stay so thank you Niya! 
11437509,209723215,2017-11-05,26750997,Carrie,I cannot say enough about how great this experience was!!! Maria's home is perfectly set up for airbnb guests. Everything was super clean. I'm a horrible sleeper and I slept so well there that I looked forward to the end of the day when I could go back to bed. The location is great well lit very safe feeling. There's an amazing coffee shop/bakery across the street that has the best croissants. If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I will definitely stay here again.

33365567,455574069,2019-05-19,20823305,Faithanne,Great hospitable host.  It felt like I was in a family member's home.  Nancy is very welcoming and friendly and gave tips on places to eat which were great.  Charming place right close to downtown Cole Valley and close to Golden Gate Park.  I would definitely recommend this room in this home to anyone.
2166428,78938162,2016-06-10,8517805,Dan,My wife son and myself had a great time in Tisa's apartment.  Her place is right off the historic Haight Street and the building had that older feel but as we walked into the apartment it was totally clean and fresh.  The couch and bed was super comfortable and handful of little notes were left to guide us through the use of the place.  Books on travel within San Fran were especially helpful.  Right from the beginning Tisa was very responsive letting us know about check-in and checkout and then responded to several inquiries and requests during our 2 day stay.  We had a great time and plan to stay here again next time we fly back from Sydney.  Thanks again Tisa.
22671938,404598602,2019-01-24,2442976,Greg,I had a super convenient stay at Dario’s place.  Very convenient check-in.  Due to my late arrival and early departure I didn’t get a chance to meet Dario directly but his communications were fast and thorough.
2486953,456866554,2019-05-22,16639295,Jeff,Wow! This was a memorable and truly beautiful apartment in San Francisco. Vincent has by far the cleanest Airbnb property I have stayed in. He is extremely communicative and offers up endless tips for the city. Vincent is such a nice guy; he even held open an umbrella and dragged our luggage up his steps when we arrived (it was late at night and raining). The neighborhood of Noe Valley is quaint and offers a very homey feeling. It was also a nice location to walk to Mission Dolores Park Hayes Valley and  not a far ride to Chinatown Russian Hill Twin Peaks and other must see neighborhoods. The apartment has everything you need and then some. He even left great snacks and goodies. There is nothing more I would ask for! The photos are as good as advertised maybe even better in person!
5162669,322320203,2018-09-12,202813298,Elisha,"Carol was extremely helpful friendly and accommodating. She made sure we knew how to get from the airport to her place and went out of her way to get information for us when we needed to get to an appointment in the suburbs. She also recommended several local businesses to us. The apartment is decorated with lots of beautiful artwork and the back patio has an incredible view of the city. Our room was clean and comfortable. 

Hands down the best thing about this place is the location. There is a bus that comes right through the neighborhood and there's an incredible park and numerous businesses within walking distance including a great grocery store and several restaurants.

One thing to note is that the kitchen is an older kitchen and kind of small so if you plan to do a lot of fancy cooking it may not suit your needs. However it was fine for us since we mostly just needed the microwave toaster oven and coffee maker. Carol was even so kind as to get up and make coffee each morning. If you want a great location in the heart of the city I would definitely recommend this place."
9435665,132065105,2017-02-15,78503533,Peter,Excellent clean beautiful house great neighborhood
15346313,109975019,2016-10-23,97817492,J,Maria was great host and the space was clean & spacious.
4957143,210478134,2017-11-09,19757747,Angie,Beth and Tom were amazing hosts. They both met me at the house and showed me everything about the place. The house was great. It was in a nice neighborhood very quiet super clean and had all the amenities you could ever need. My stay was so comfortable. Almost didn’t want to leave.

63247,342514080,2018-10-28,19690908,Mike,A lovely little space w all the standards and the additional plusses  of a gorgeous leafy street view n golden hour sun streaming thru the large front window. The hosts professional grade art on the wall n an assortment of old n new in the neighborhood (Wise Bros Deli/Phils gourmet coffee/mexican bakery) make it this a great Stay w an indigenous feel. Prob small for 2 but great for me. Thanks to wonderful and communicative hosts.
1030352,12063824,2014-04-22,12898072,Slavek,"First time doing the Airbnb thing and it was pretty easy the apartment was exactly as described and the hosts accommodating to our changing the number of guests last minute. The beds were amazing super comfortable. The twin would be tough for someone over 6' tall but then maybe the tall ones should get the big beds. Artwork was pretty cool too so overall it was a very comfortable nicely appointed house.

Neighborhood was great as someone else posted the house is actually a little further east than shown on the map not that close to Dolores Park but that was not an issue as it was just a 12 minute walk to the Bart and close enough to everything. Cool area and we were able to easily access the entire city through a combination of public transit and Uber."
18587279,505747422,2019-08-09,33229236,Karen,Five stars for everything! Very clean space and perfect for two people. Surprised to hear that people took points off for location - we ended up checking in at 1 AM after a full day of exploring and I didn’t feel unsafe at all. It was a quiet neighborhood and we were able to get to many places within 20-40 min by car. Ken was very responsive and kind to remind us about the street cleaning which I really appreciated! I was able to hear people upstairs but it didn’t bother us at all since we didn’t hear much by the time we slept. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to visit!
992913,160838208,2017-06-15,72282515,Joscha,Very central place with a super helpful tenant. Lovely contact. Shower is a bit low for people above 1.80m of height. Otherwise very recommendable.
34906463,463690122,2019-06-03,48083615,Ciera,"Such a comfortable nice spot for just a 1 night trip. I felt safe and comfy - and such a good deal too! Nice to be part of the community - even if only for a day. 
Thanks!"

727969,141572284,2017-04-03,28954750,Samantha,Grace and Steve's place was awesome! Grace was very kind to let us check in early and checked on us to make sure everything was alright. The place was clean and accurate from the pictures. The bathroom was better in person! The kitchen was great our group cooked most of our meals there. Thank you guys for the hospitality and sorry if our group was being too loud.  
6080799,419786327,2019-03-04,174364545,Dongwoo,Clean and stylish place in SF right by the water. My wife and I had a wonderful time and Sara responds promptly. Parking was easy to find and the neighborhood is quiet and clean. I would definitely stay here again if I visit SF.
971116,100708638,2016-09-10,36371182,Thomas,A wonderful airbnb experience. Staying at Michaels beautiful apartment was a pleasure. Michael was also a perfect host. We would always come back. Highly recommended!
4720512,447448448,2019-05-03,7659177,Cecilia,Jose and Jeffrey's place was totally lovely. The place  is situated in a great neighbourhood with easy bus rides and walks to all parts of town. Our room was cosy and clean and we had everything that we needed. Jose and Jeffrey were welcoming helpful and thoughtful and we could come and go with no hassle at all. Definitely recommend!

87640,22375599,2014-11-04,3011540,Chris,Karin was very accommodating with all of our needs during our stay. She had all the amenities laid out when we arrived which was great. It was a cozy comfy and clean space--a perfect getaway in SF that was close enough to get around but tucked away in a quiet little neighborhood. Check-in and check-out procedures were easy and convenient. 
2374267,66002758,2016-03-18,11821224,Nick,Hands down best AirBnB experience so far!  Leslie and Steve were super accommodating with my crew and I who were staying in the city for 4 nights on a film shoot.  They allowed us to store our gear in the garage gave us both their parking spots and regularly checked with me to make sure we had everything we needed.  The home is GORGEOUS and centrally located to everything that matters.  Absolutely a gem of AirBnB and if you have the opportunity to stay here I could not recommend booking this lovely home more.  Beyond 5 stars good. 
6543813,301187781,2018-08-03,24163377,Larry,By far the best experience I’ve had on Airbnb. The warmest welcome the best bed and most delicious coffee ever. And loved the location and surrounding neighborhood. 
2551994,23283371,2014-11-27,7188843,Caroline,Joy was superb. Communication prior to our booking was timely. Joy helped us more than we expected. I cannot recommend her and the apartment enough. And the local food recommendations were spot on. Thank you so much Joy.
11888682,106184462,2016-10-04,19264201,Jennifer,Barbara was a lovely host who provided everything we could have needed.  We would definitely recommend her place.  The only thing I would make more clear is that the space is the top floor of her apt not a stand alone home.  However it is still quite private.
1633225,338533378,2018-10-19,56786663,Yvan,"Best airbnb i ever stayed in.
Unmatched view"
1944564,512876363,2019-08-18,94846648,Pavit,We loved staying here for a quick getaway to SF. This is such a unique place. Parking was not an issue and bunch of grocery stores and restaurants walking distance. We will definitely be back.
20154622,500200815,2019-08-01,274941500,Emma,If you are looking to stay in SF this is the perfect cute little spot. And yes the breakfast is a 11/10. The place is clean and very cute. Lance and Marilyn were great hosts!
7038488,140973347,2017-04-01,110239964,Lisa,Heather's house is a fantastic place to stay! Very comfortable and in a great location. There were lots of places to eat and buy provisions nearby and lots of places to explore!! It is situated close to Golden Gate Park and museums as well as right near the N-train for travel to the city (about 45-60 min and crowded at times!) and beach. Heather's house was very clean and homey and the neighbourhood is very safe. It has a very cool heritage feeling with unique flooring beautiful lush backyard and a fantastic comfortable family friendly living space. Very welcomed touches like super soft fresh towels beautiful warm throw blankets for the couch (which is so comfortable!) and even fresh fruit for arrival!! She has compiled a great set of resource notes with lots of maps and menus. The best suggestion she made was to climb the mosaic stairs up to the top of the lookout hill for the most spectacular view from city GG bridge GG park to ocean. Absolutely magnificent!! Heather is a tremendously gracious host who was easy and enjoyable to communicate with. She really helped make our stay wonderful! We would absolutely stay here again!
8987674,504475613,2019-08-07,237794243,Ross,We couldn't rate this place or the hosts highly enough. It was the perfect base for our San Fran adventures - lovely neighbourhood walking distance to Fillmore Street and even the Presidio and a cheap taxi ride to anywhere else. Pam and David were brilliant - so friendly helpful welcoming and available but also gave us all the space we needed to enjoy our holiday. And their home is beautiful - big room comfortable bed great shower and the roof deck was perfect. We recommend staying here wholeheartedly and will certainly consider returning if and when we come back to San Fran (which we hope to do as the city is amazing!).
25234139,417905833,2019-02-28,11375653,James,"Alok's place was immaculately decorated and the attention to detail in the design of the space was greatly appreciated! The small homey touches around the apartment made the space feel very upscale.  The location was also a huge plus being close to some wonderful Mission restaurants and bars just down the street. Overall we had a great stay!

The only improvements would be more useful things required for long term stays such as more storage space more robust kitchen utensils for cooking and a mailbox. There isn't a washer / dryer but some decent laundromats down the block. Also the bathroom fans automatically turn on every hour or so and are kind of loud. Not sure why they turn on and off so often on their own."
21461483,461559461,2019-05-31,68729896,Benjamin,Had a great stay Kim is very friendly and the place is clean and quiet.
2783251,495220813,2019-07-25,26986345,Christophe,Very nice apartement with a great (private) garden.  The rooms are clean. Ellen has been really helpful and reactive. The apt is really near lots of nice places in SF (Fisherman's Chinatown Beat Musuem Lombard Street is the next street...).
13652971,110489062,2016-10-26,2356751,Crouch,Terrific!
7178670,100701879,2016-09-10,91135385,Daniel,"A wonderful penthouse in a great location.

Ryan was the perfect host and helped us out with every question and request.

Great facilities and I would highly recommend staying here."
1556680,143825745,2017-04-13,59101625,Elissa,Great house.  Very cozy and clean.  Host was great communicating with us. Great location. Everything was easy.  
13021568,172085466,2017-07-19,129830244,Stacci,"We couldn't ask for a more attentive host. The place was clean and tidy. Kitchen had all the things you needed including a range of fruit cereal toast and coffee for breakfast. Public transport to city centre was simple. Wasn't much within walking distance but was a nice quiet neighbourhood.
Would definitely recommend this to anyone."
17812931,411825568,2019-02-13,59778762,Andrew,Awesome host and the included breakfast was very much appreciated. Had a great stay here!
1759087,49152504,2015-10-01,20044856,Linda,Thank you to Gerardohhlill!   This is a wonderful studio with a lovely outside patio and in a great little neighborhood.   It is also close to the Mission Bay Conference Center UCSF campus and the Children's hospital.   It was really a perfect place for my meetings at the Conference Center.   A cozy place away from home.
1627259,164814776,2017-06-29,25141941,Nathália,Great location and space! Kitchen well equipped!
4558898,301763921,2018-08-04,32185621,Marcel,Jane's apartment is very well appointed. Definitely enjoyed staying there and would recommend to anyone visiting SF
24013191,535155201,2019-09-23,85773787,Amanda,Very spacious basement unit.  Couch and beds not in the best condition couch had a lot of stains and beds sunk very low when you laid on them.  Sheets seemed dirty had stains and odor.  Unit is very musty as it is in the basement with very limited fresh air.  Unit does have several doors and windows but no screens so leaving them open isn’t an option unless you want to allow in mosquitoes ect. Only one mirror in the entire unit so be prepared to have smaller hand mirrors if traveling with a large group since the only mirror is in the bathroom. Bedrooms were very spacious and had decent size closets.  All bedrooms and common area had smart tv with Netflix and other options.  Unit is in the basement so expect lots of stairs it wasnt ideal for us with a car seat and stroller but we made it work and started leaving the stroller on the landing by the door.  Host provided towels but it seemed to be 1 towel per person for the whole 4 day stay would like to have had more towels as there was only 1 door hook to allow towels to dry and not be on the floor.  Unit is in a great location very close to the wharf and downtown and walking distance to bars restaurant and convenience store.  Would stay again if screens were installed and cleaner sheets or washer in unit was provided.
22671938,414051242,2019-02-18,76145201,Ryan,I spent the weekend in SF with a group of friends and Dario's space was the perfect spot for us. Finding a place with that many beds in Soma for the price was a great deal and we would all definitely stay here again.
647360,535968956,2019-09-25,130214972,Alex,"L’appartamento era fantastico pulito ordinato con tutti i confort che si possono desiderare.
Zona molto tranquilla è raggiungibile con Uber senza problemi.
Lo consigliamo a tutti."

19904931,218947053,2017-12-15,73884394,Brandon,Great place beautifully location.
5196116,246085506,2018-03-24,256515,Claudia,This is a great space. I worked from my room when I did not have meetings downtown. Good wifi excellent shower and empty and clean room.  The bed was comfy too.  It was chilly when I was there but the space heater Annie provided worked great.  In the morning I could open the window to get some fresh air.  I was very pleased with the set up. Although it is not sound proof the neighborhood was quiet and I could hear the family upstairs but it was not disturbing.
593253,145939906,2017-04-20,126094143,Jennifer,Trevor has such a lovely place. Nice quiet room in a great location!
8221207,75100196,2016-05-18,15490313,Akiko,I rented this cute and convenient place for my parents staying. The owner was really kind to them. Thank you so much Tietjen!!
37720938,555491467,2019-10-27,232639382,Anfisa,I stayed two nights it was a great experience. The place is clean and the location was perfect.
16043093,223784993,2018-01-01,5731788,Nikki,Wonderful experience! Highly highly recommend for anyone staying in SF but especially small families. Stacy was incredibly helpful and welcoming. The apartment was perfect. One of the best Airbnb stays we have ever had!
25432800,289572297,2018-07-12,175219168,Gerhard,Really a great stay at great hosts. The house is very stylish and as promised on airbnb. Exellent and fast communication. JD is very supportiv and his hospitality is excellent. With one sentence: We would come back to JD and his house any time again.
11437138,239440522,2018-03-01,2568257,Mary,This is a wonderful spot that feels more like a communal living environment than just your average Airbnb.  It’s incredbly comfortable in both the room and in shared spaces and Maria had done an amazing job providing well organized amenities- great selection of breakfast and even laundry supplies.  Fun neighborhood with nice local spots to eat drink and shop and convenient to the FiDi for work. Even comes with a sweet and silly brown dog:)   I’ll definitely stay again
3168359,268375807,2018-05-24,178814971,Rhonda,It was a pleasure to stay at Jamie's place.  She could not have been more friendly and accommodating.  She was quick to respond to any and all messages.  Her place was very clean with personal touches that made our stay that much better.  I would definitely recommend anyone wanting a personal feel to their stay in San Francisco.  
770991,535987193,2019-09-25,14203385,Christoph,Rose is a great host a breeze to communicate with and provides great tips for San Francisco and the neighbourhood. The place is very cute spacious and in a quiet street but still close to everything for exploring San Francisco. Highly recommend the place and Rose. Would definitely stay again.
138619,342926432,2018-10-29,20222808,Craig,Great place. As described.  Would stay again
7309852,78851627,2016-06-09,63621946,Takashi,"Maria and Ben are so kind host.
I super recommend thier place for 
family. cleannice and quiet house
I will come back when I visit San Francisco agagain!"
16721946,177361812,2017-08-02,118221395,Deborah,"The apartment was modern and everything in it appeared to be brand new.  It's situated in a fairly quiet street just a couple of blocks from a K line tram stop that took you straight into downtown SF (or to the BART in the other direction).  Parking could've been a problem but we managed ok and found a space no more than 20 metres away from the front door.     Plenty of places to eat ( the Vietnamese at the end of the street was fab for a take out) and there is a Target supermarket within easy walking distance. People have commented that the boiler is noisy - it is no worse than an aircon unit and caused us no problems whatsoever. Washer/ drier is in the garage.   Huge TV and comfy sofa to watch it from. When cooking - the smoke detector is a little over enthusiastic so make sure the fan is on! We had a great stay at Doris' apartment and would definetly return if we came back to SF.
Lots to do in SF - for a special treat tho' - we recommend a seaplane flight over the city from Sausalito - not cheap but worth every penny (cent!).

23240184,267793330,2018-05-22,26764218,Vivian,Rachel was super nice in being flexible! She let us drop off our things before check in which was super helpful. The place was super clean & had all of the necessary amenities the heater came in handy! The only reason I would not return is because of the bed. It is super hard/uncomfortable so it was hard to get a good night rest. Other than that Rachel is an awesome host. :)
18767723,301774863,2018-08-04,194285292,Sarah,Great space that is clean and comfortable! Had some breakfast items in the fridge which was convenient! Bathroom is brand new! Would love to come back again! 
10469182,337838459,2018-10-17,40882720,Christopher,Cosy spot close to Golden Gate Park as well as other points of interest. Comfy space with nearly everything you’d expect amenity-wise.
8382187,287949210,2018-07-08,24657997,Nikki,Ludmela’s place was exactly as expected. Perfect location for those looking to be near Land’s End and away from the bustle of San Francisco.  Comfortable for a couple of solo traveller but would not recommend for any larger a group. Was great having access to a garage. 
14538591,459768737,2019-05-27,241949965,Elyse,Pauline's place was a great place to stay. Very clean. Comfy bed. The hosts are friendly and very accommodating. Not great if you want to cook but there's Trouble Coffee a short walk away which serves great coffee. There also a few cafes nearby which are good too.
24149977,548463404,2019-10-17,292075861,Jonathan,This exceeded my expectations.  The neighborhood was great with plenty of places nearby to grab food or coffee.  Public transportation was a block away.  The pictures were true and accurate.  Definitely stay here again.
17438541,407637951,2019-02-02,166256213,Salome,"Guanying is a very conscientious hostess she was very happy to assist with a personal need for a blender. 
Tom was very prompt to bring requested items.
 A big plus for us as well was the needed parking since we rented a car. 
The location to the UCSF is  easy fast and home is located in quiet part of town.
I highly recommend a stay at Guanying's place. They are wonderful hosts."
8105974,329406934,2018-09-28,10551408,Joe,Honestly  this was one of the most enjoyable Airbnb experiences I’ve ever had. Lisa & Simone’s home is amazing and they’re such gracious and thoughtful hosts. The space is comfortable warm and inviting. The location is perfect with restaurants and bars practically within spitting distance. I would recommend this space for anybody visiting SF - it’s a wonderful value and the hosts go above and beyond to make guests feel at home.
28733771,401202088,2019-01-13,48216564,Lily,Jessica’s place was great! Very clean space & only a few blocks from cafes/market/Bart. Would recommend!
4663060,80021585,2016-06-15,4271596,Kat,"Mark's apartment is light and very comfortable.  It doesn't have a full kitchen (as he notes in the description).  The neighborhood is great and has lots of restaurants and take out to choose from.  Parking is also very easy (which is not often the case in SF).  

Mark is a very responsive and helpful host.   I would be happy to stay at his place again.  "
14907455,563414247,2019-11-12,74882430,Xin,Good place to stay. Quick response. 4 minutes walk to BRAT
9752333,524812084,2019-09-06,19617155,Bob,"This is a real gem of a place we were able to park outside without problems and then we used Uber to travel into the city but you could use MuniMobile. 
The place is large & light with a nice decking/garden area with occasionally the odd raccoon on the skylight during the night. 
Thanks for the use of the washing machine and like how there is a microwave also we cheated and went out for meals. There are some great recommendations for places to visit and eat at. 
Looking forward to coming back"
24013191,520611556,2019-08-30,276612762,Charlie,Couch needs to be replaced.   Neighborhood is a bit on the seedy side.   Would add a deadbolt to a quickly code entry door.   Ground floor with multiple exterior doors.  Only a microwave and small beer fridge.
238204,566562197,2019-11-19,308530350,Bryan,In our case we were searching endlessly for a last minute Airbnb that fit our standards and Jennifer Maria and Andrew were there to accommodate us within 5 hours of the time we booked. Their place was spotless cozy in a great area and was filled with many useful amenities. Needless to say their hospitality was top notch. We are looking forward to our next stay with them.
3290739,318877189,2018-09-04,57535912,Miranda,Great accommodations in the heart of San Fran proper. Despite being in the center of it all it was quiet at night which made sleeping great. Place is very conveniently located and the room and bathroom had everything I needed for a wonderful stay. Hosts were welcoming and gave me local tips about area restaurants parking etc. Highly recommend this Airbnb!
1080980,10807981,2014-03-08,827306,Jackie,We used the space for a work gathering during the day. It is spacious and clean. Exactly what we needed to get the job done. We would use this space again for work purposes in the future for sure.
4896087,103900141,2016-09-24,53994360,Molly,We were getting slightly nervous having not received the check in details the night before we were due to arrive but on the whole Nikolas was good at communication and comes across as friendly and helpful answering all my questions. We did get all the details (and a lot of information) in time and once we'd got there the apartment is really lovely and just like the pictures. It's the perfect size for a couple and in a nice area. As it's on the top of the hill you get stunning views over the city from the street and the cable cars run really close by.
4418649,421147746,2019-03-08,56596121,Sandeep,Nice and cozy place that is located close to the BART lines making it very convenient to reach the airport as well as downtown.  The bedroom has all the necessary amenities. Bathroom is shared - sparkling clean though. The place is ideal for single travelers. Zemfira is a very helpful person!
2160504,14394935,2014-06-18,14613914,Airlie,Will and Carlos were the most wonderful hosts. Their apartment was neat and welcoming and we could not have had a more enjoyable stay. We had a car so I cannot comment on the use of public transport from Will's place but we were never more than 20-30mins drive from all the spots we wanted to check out. Will is friendly communicative and helpful. We can't thank him enough!
4748287,334374906,2018-10-08,184116874,Ian,The reviews were spot on. Place was very clean and very convenient for my needs as I worked at the hospital down the street. It was very easy to walk to work or grab a bite to eat. Highly recommended.
9346930,364971334,2018-12-31,220423428,Mark Benedikt,Very nice appartement and in a nice location. It was easy to reach everything in San Francisco with public transport. There is enough space for 4 persons and everything was clean.
37979788,563048077,2019-11-11,124315182,Tony,The space was exactly what I was looking for!  My favorite part was discovering an out door deck and patio overlooking the valley.  I had breakfast there on my last day.  So beautiful and peaceful!
7421008,173604948,2017-07-23,26855077,Jamie,Fiona was awesome. Communicated great and offered a clean and quiet place to stay.

13239943,144100998,2017-04-14,122442063,Lisa,This is a clean friendly efficient hotel in a fantastic location.  The parking alone would be worth staying here but the hotel is also clean and very well-maintained.  
21026964,401456860,2019-01-14,234911368,Sophie,If you are looking for a comfortable home located in a vibrant neighborhood of San Francisco and if you are willing to connect with other friendly and open minded travelers artists dancers... this place will be heaven for you!
8499631,456120387,2019-05-20,11455273,Dominik,Sehr gepflegtes und modern eingerichtetes Appartment im Mission District. Perfekte Ausgangsbasis um die Stadt zu entdecken aber man kann auch einfach vor dem Kamin sitzen und ein Buch lesen. Sehr zu empfehlen
4833101,330530279,2018-09-30,101105205,Jon,Great host. Great house. Great location.
2686530,498477775,2019-07-29,35032645,Eunjee,Jeana is a great host. Her house is beautifully decorated and sparkling clean. I’ll definitely book again her place if I come back to SF.
352165,428722504,2019-03-25,162169638,Ella,Brian’s place is in such an ideal location for a weekend trip to San Francisco. We very much enjoyed staying here and would stay again.
27832283,346206488,2018-11-07,50551780,Daniel,The space is cool and cozy after a walking up all the crazy hills. Perfect napping location! Try the food off Balboa and walk to lookout point for a sunset.
950094,19751285,2014-09-17,20835530,Steve,"We had a wonderful short stay with Gaylene - our best airbnb to date!  

Most of her house is dedicated to you the traveller and you will find you have a spacious living/dining/bedroom area with a spectacular view of San Francisco in all her glory.  Great views both day and night which make you feel like you can see the sights from the comfort of your extremely comfy bed.

Gaylene lives in the front part of the house but you'd never know she was there.  If you bump into her in the shared kitchen you will find her to be a warm interesting and vibrant character and we had a great time chatting and exchanging travel stories over some wine.  She even offered to take care of our laundry!

The kitchen is a good size is stocked with the bits and pieces you need  and is a great asset if you don't want to eat out every day.  Breakfast and coffee watching the light coming up over the city from our room was a treat. 

Our stay felt like being at home - would thoroughly recommend!"
11610642,365856555,2019-01-01,1002524,Laura,"We had a wonderful 10 day stay at Uli's beautiful home. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything you need for a long term rental. The location is incredibly central close to the Castro with easy street parking and lots of supermarkets nearby. 

The living room bedrooms and bathrooms were nicely decorated and comfortable and we loved how well documented everything was in the home manual. 

We will likely stay here again the next time we visit our daughter!"
1623609,317869585,2018-09-02,79973787,Daphne,The accommodation is clean very nice spacious and well located in the cute mission district. Ingrid is a very helpful and kind person. I really recommend her accommodation!
1069167,341019785,2018-10-25,38681804,Laura,This apartment is really cool and offers everything you need. It’s close to everything if you have a car or use Lyft. The hosts are kind and ready to give you any advice.
16335125,226851631,2018-01-12,148981308,Alejandro,Erika fue muy amable nos recibió con mucha atención teníamos bebidas en la heladera galletita  te  café  y hasta una barra de chocolate y una botella de vino       El departamento es muy bonito y está en un lindo barrio que sí bien está alejado del centro para mi tenía una excelente ubicación        Sin dudas volvería
7345170,505721912,2019-08-09,17050083,Fairouz,Jack & Christina are very involved hosts who will do basically anything to make you feel comfortable in their home. The house is beautiful very clean and you will have everything that you need for a good stay. I especially loved the area with Dolores Park and the cute streets of Noe Valley nearby. The view from the terrace is amazing! If you like to stay in a traditional b&b with close contact with your host then this is the place for you!
1478708,145517760,2017-04-18,121456881,Cristina,Staying at Mary's place was the first airbnb reservation we made and it proved to be excellent! Mary is such a nice and welcoming host. The stay at her home just made our trip in SF very pleasant. The house is near the ocean and the park which made for delightful long walks on sunny days. Also Mary very carefully prepared breakfast for us every morning. The coffee is great! What I especially liked about Mary is that she will respect your privacy. I recommend her as a host and her home with all my heart! I would definitely choose to stay there again if I were travelling to SF again. 
3218306,16666614,2014-07-31,3442402,Alfonso,Everithyng was ok in Joshua apartment. It is quite close to Castro and well served by public transport. We had the possibility to use kitchen for breakfast and dinner and the sofa for relaxing. There is a big balcony with a beautiful view of the city. Joshua is very helpful. Consider that evening in July it is cold!
7327920,245514834,2018-03-22,89125,Madeline,Katie's place is even better than it seems! A great location with a stunning view incredibly comfortable bed and fluffy towels. We chose to stay with Katie in preparation for our SF City Hall wedding and Katie was incredibly gracious with sweet touches like a little sign welcoming us and offering to move our car because of street cleaning when we were at our ceremony. I couldn't recommended her place more!
738547,564804305,2019-11-16,125748698,Nancy,"Great location. 
Robert was friendly and responsive."
18596420,197530264,2017-09-25,122391191,Lina,Abby was really kind and helpful with everything we needed. The room was really spacious and clean. We really enjoyed the time we spent at Abby's place. We would definitely stay there again.
26303324,443334399,2019-04-25,6323640,Charlie,Su was very responsive and easy to communicate with. The apartment is super clean and quiet. I’d definitely stay here again.
394575,296857698,2018-07-26,158108703,Georgina,Very clean and comfortable studio. Quite private.
14611058,284650053,2018-07-01,22683158,Olivia,Beware if you cannot walk 4 flights of stairs no elevator. Do not bring a personal car parking is nonexistent. Cleanliness and noise level is completely up to your luck of who you live with. Overall a 7/10 experience. Not the safest neighboorhood or quiet so if street noises BART or sirens bother you caution.  It's nice dishes and towels are provided but no tissues or laundry detergent purchase your own.
1247160,12432360,2014-05-02,13383112,Terence,Sam was very communicative with regards to check-in and the location was fantastic for the price. The main reason we chose this location over a hostel and paid a premium was that it offered kitchen facilities unfortunately the kitchen and its contents were extremely dirty and there were few and in some cases none of the kitchen appliances pots or utensils that we would have expected from an apartment that advertised such facilities. There was no ventilation of the room as it has neither windows nor air conditioning. The bathrooms were clean but otherwise the cleanliness of the apartment was extremely poor. The nature of the location is not what one expects from an Airbnb location as there is no host but a manager.
22998690,400603332,2019-01-12,11012028,Virya,Lu’s apartment is very beautiful the view from the balcony is relaxing. Everything went very smoothly Lu is a welcoming host who likes to share her local adresses. Thank you for this short but very nice stay !
21591469,250959499,2018-04-06,50070579,Lola,Sitio muy agradable todo nuevo limpio y Jonathan ha sido un buen anfitrión. Me he sentido como en casa.
21529297,247806865,2018-03-29,13166381,Tania,"Charlie’s place is well located and Charlie provides helpful guidance. The bedroom is nicely decorated as is the whole apartment. We got on very well with the other couple staying there which made it really fun!
Charlie generously provides the wherewithal for making breakfast and keeps the place spotless."
1920033,13872077,2014-06-07,12040094,Ursula,Kevin met us on a very late bus. I would not have blamed him for feeling cranky but he didn't show it! His house is squeaky clean no clutter beautiful thick fluffy towels ample beautiful food for breakfast. bus goes past his front door & stops at the underground. We found the curfew on showering or using the kitchen between 10 pm & 7am a bit hard to deal with as we were always arriving late & leaving early but the plumbing certainly is noisy. Maybe you could put the coffee machine in the lounge for those leaving early? We loved that he was visable & prepared to share a little of his life with us
8584000,62455046,2016-02-14,4975112,Ada,Amy is very responsive to the messages and patient to provide the details or answer my questions. Amy's place is 100% like the pictures and it is even more than our expectation. It is spacious clean quiet and has everything you will need such as all the bathroom essentials. The beds are very comfortable including the bedroom queen bed and the sofa bed. Location is perfect if you would like to explore Hayes Valley. 5-10 min walk to lots of cafe restaurants shops and bars. The parking space is not easy to find around Amy's house but Amy and her neighbor Marian help to solve the parking problem immediately which is really awesome!

ｻﾝﾌﾗﾝｼｽｺ中心部から､ﾒﾄﾛﾊﾞｽで20-30分+徒歩15-20分くらいの場所にあります｡ｻﾝﾌﾗﾝｼｽｺ空港からは､市中心部に向かうBARTという列車の､途中駅下車+ﾊﾞｽ15-20分+徒歩10分ほどの場所です｡中心部とは若干距離はありますが､ｻﾝﾌﾗﾝｼｽｺの色々な面もみれて､私は楽しかったです｡
周辺は､ｱﾌﾘｶ系･南ｱｼﾞｱ系のﾛｰﾜｰﾐﾄﾞﾙｸﾗｽの人達が多い印象の住宅街です｡夜の一人歩きは個人的には若干躊躇を覚えましたが､昼間は全く問題ないと感じました｡
ﾁｪｯｸｲﾝ･ｱｳﾄもｽﾑｰｽﾞで､柔軟に対処して頂きました｡

32257360,528785243,2019-09-13,2147691,Matt,Really lovely place Lynn was super responsive and helpful. Highly recommend
31540050,409399824,2019-02-07,216560037,Uli,Die Unterkunft war wie beschrieben und kann sehr gut weiterempfohlen werden. Die Gastfreundschaft war hervorragend und sehr herzlich.
1017799,157865645,2017-06-04,14546864,Christine,I cannot leave enough positive feedback to even do Kameh justice. Her place was amazing and so is she.  She helped me easily navigate my way there as I had never been to San Francisco; so before I got there I could see that she would be a great host. But on top of that her place is gorgeous and exactly what I was looking for! The neighborhood is perfect--it's clean sweet safe has character and  stunning residential architectural typical only to SF. There are coffee shops and restaurants nearby (including the #1 voted coffee in SF) and if you're in the mood for a walk it's a stroll away from The Castro neighborhood. The bedroom is quiet and minimalistic with plenty of space for your stuff. There's even a charming garden and hillside view outside the window. Kameh was a great host off doing her own thing most of the time. She was extremely accommodating and helped me out when there was confusion over my dates of staying; she was kind enough to work something out with me so I didn't have to scramble and pay much much more on the very last night I was there. Two thumbs up!! An amazing visit. I'll be back to stay at her place again.
207980,3891939,2013-03-25,4130995,Daniele,Bruce is super kind and thoughtful.  His house is spacious with a great layout and nice design and has a beautiful view from the top of SF down to the water.  The neighborhood is a gem (I used to live in SF and never visited Diamond Heights now I want to live there if I ever move back).  My sisters our friends and I all spent the weekend for a bachelorette.  We were up front with Bruce about our plans and followed his few rules (main rule was to keep the noise inside after dark).  Not only was he super accommodating - he also brought us breakfast rolls gave us helpful tips on our plans and (as mentioned earlier) was super nice.  On Saturday we did yoga in the park behind Safeway (a beautiful park that is at the top of Canyon Park with great views and great hiking trails) and then we walked down to Dolores Park (1.2 hour) where we had a picnic lunch on the lawn.  For going out we grabbed inexpensive cab rides down into the more popular dining and dancing districts.  At Bruce's house you really get the best of both city and views - with parking and fresh air!  Definitely would recommend a stay to anyone especially larger groups with special occasions.  Thank Bruce!
4948327,274248900,2018-06-08,48330940,Mary,This is a perfect place for the money and location.  The bath has to be shared as well as the kitchen.  But it is close to Golden Gate Park and on the way to the ocean.  I would recommend it to the economy-minded.
295240,251290996,2018-04-07,46720057,Jamie,Great apartment close to public transport and restaurants and amazing hot tub!
10886231,106515222,2016-10-06,18752132,Kurt,Joy made me feel welcome. Their place is pretty far from most of the typically touristy parts of the city. My room was comfortable and all I really needed. I did wish for a window treatment that closed entirely. The center panel was a wispy sort of fabric that let outside streetlight shine into the room. Not a huge deal unless you like to sleep in the dark like me. Also my sense of the bathroom was that it could have been cleaner. Otherwise my stay was good.
3611131,438077339,2019-04-15,7557075,Enzina,Great spot for a solo traveler or couple! Reasonably priced for the area and close enough to main SF sights.  Sweet coffeeshops nearby and grocery options as well!  There is no couch in the space - a bed and a chair in the room - but very cozy. The bed is also very comfortable.
1460628,512777807,2019-08-18,77881576,Edward,Great place to stay to explore San Francisco.  Apartment had everything we needed.
5068486,84176908,2016-07-05,12065113,Denise,We had a wonderful stay in Karen's apartment.  She welcomed us with a delicious basket of treats wine and fresh flowers.  The neighborhood was nice with restaurants nearby.  The apartment was very comfortable with a relaxing patio area where we enjoyed morning coffee.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay again when in the city and highly recommend.  Thank you Karen!
6430646,232866929,2018-02-06,155778496,Paul,First class apartment really clean and well furnished. Public transport close by giving easy access to the city. Would thoroughly recommend as a place to stay.

35340000,571073018,2019-11-30,91204543,Jeff,Ed was a gracious host that made everything seamless. Great space for anything from a business meeting to a family gathering like we had.  12 for thanksgiving but could have been 20.  Highly recommend.
8762967,254444515,2018-04-16,9787149,Joan,Quiet  private location. Nice outdoor space if the weather cooperates. Not a real living space to hang out.

29038374,355071776,2018-12-02,135843191,Minkyoung,It is really good location from the station. I enjoyed staying Mary’s house so much!
71645,257560513,2018-04-26,8761207,Amir,Jeff's studio is located in a quiet and lovely hilly neighborhood not too far from city center. The space was clean and tidy and the garden was very beautiful.
4638678,91725404,2016-08-06,79358792,Nicole,The pictures definitely reflect exactly how the room looks. It's a little small but if you are out all day its the perfect place to lay your head down after a long day. The bathroom was much nicer than we expected very clean. Really liked that the main doors were locked at night and you could only get in with your key made it feel really safe. Overall the room was great especially for the location and the price. There were bars food places coffee and stores within walking distance. The BART is also close by within walking distance. Would definitely stay here again. 
5253439,438023691,2019-04-15,153283078,Kiva,Sadly I was only here to check in sleep and check out due to the quickness of my trip but it was a lovely space nonetheless! Cozy like a house with all the amenities of being in a hostel- perfect for what I needed. Will be back if I'm in the Bay for a few nights!
14422371,536925359,2019-09-27,44500535,Piotr,I recommend super hosts great location and safe neighborhood
12362408,276094252,2018-06-12,93736109,Gaynor,Majid has a great place. It’s in he middle of everything - easy to walk to any number of great sites.  Especially appreciated the little touches like phone charges self stick power pack coffee creamer hair ties and do on.

4093967,66443090,2016-03-22,44784455,Maria,This was our first experience staying at an Airbnb property. I had booked one previously for an actor client who had good things to say about his experience. My goddaughter and I were made to feel welcome from the time our reservation was confirmed until the time we left and immediately felt at home as we cooked a simple meal in the kitchen upon our arrival.  The bedroom and shared bathroom were pristine and the beds were comfortable.  The floors are hardwood throughout the house and the rooms are downstairs so one should take that into consideration when booking. I can't imagine staying at another impersonal hotel in the City and hope to be able to stay here when I return.
13022232,99088113,2016-09-03,43221548,Lenka,Peihong is the sweetest person ever! :) We had late arrival she waited for us to meet us in person she even made a plate of fruits for us and offered us to eat a great soup! The breakfast with coffee is available. Everything was extremely clean comfy we felt like in hotel. Peihong helped us also with laundry she is just the host you want to stay with!! 100% guarantee! She focuses on details. The location is good you are downtown SF in about 20 mins by bus. Thank you so much for having us Peihong! Such a pleasure to meet you! :) Lenka & Richard
2277754,42892802,2015-08-16,23041978,Cecilia,Deborah is an amazing host! She is warm and friendly and opens her home to her guests from her heart. I was made to feel welcome and at home from the minute I arrived. She offered me great advice on what to do and where to go based on my interests. The room and the home is exactly as described on the listing and as shown in the photos posted. Deborah's place is immaculately kept and very comfortable. I loved the location and the area. It's a very short stroll to some of the amazing cafe and bars in the Mission District. I highly recommend Deborah's place and would definitely stay there again. Thank you Deborah for hosting me and sharing you beautiful space with me :)
31718067,524853696,2019-09-06,287660800,Emma,Cédric and Jun's place was very clean. Lovely and homey but stylish. Check-in and out was easy. Cédric and Jun were very responsive and attentive!

13815224,488873681,2019-07-15,51919868,Kate,A good amount of space for San Francisco. Street parking is tough so get the garage use details from the host prior to check in. Not a fantastic neighborhood for families but just fine for a quick biz trip. Clean and comfortable.
2119773,401484552,2019-01-14,337208,Teddy,Five star experience from these super hosts. The unit is a great location for SF and South Bay activities. Plenty of good stuff to do around the neighborhood as well public transit is just a few minute walk away.
8101297,163132831,2017-06-23,34312374,Jodi,Anthony's place is located just a short Uber ride away from Fishermans wharf (or about a nice 40 min walk).  It was convienent for our for all the touristy things we wanted to do and see! The accommodations were clean and the room was a good size.  We appreciated the extra phone chargers that were on the dresser.  His dogs were friendly and very sweet.  We enjoyed our stay with Anthony and would recommend his place to anyone who is looking to visit San Francisco! 
9910056,76344474,2016-05-26,62015478,Richard,"Quiet clean right down the street from great Potrero Hill where there are great early morning coffee places and late-night restaurants. Just a 20-min walk to SOMA for work I was able to work late and come back to a very comfortable place. 

The host was extremely quick to get back to me both for the confirmation and for miscellaneous questions I had after arrival."

361230,13181632,2014-05-21,428906,Adam,Due to a family emergency I was unable to stay in Meirav's house. My friends stayed in my place and said nothing but great things about the house and the location! Meirav was BEYOND accommodating and I've definitely bookmarked this place for all my return trips to SF!

20169868,286648162,2018-07-06,86184159,Mike,Place was awesome. Great location. All the reviews on this place are correct. Super clean attention to detail and awesome communication. If your going to San Fran stay here it’s worth it.
17813890,567619139,2019-11-23,163360205,Bruce,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

20368086,250081937,2018-04-03,13279503,Lola,Je & Derren’s place was perfect for our visit to San Francisco. A little bit further out than we would have liked (the Uber rides got up to $20 at night from the downtown areas!) but the neighborhood was nice and quiet and close to some really good restaurants. Everything was very clean and beds were comfortable.
13714899,238392540,2018-02-25,10514400,Lauren,Marci is a fantastic host and easy to communicate with. Plus her listing is such a special spot in San Francisco. Highly recommend!

7226841,483521024,2019-07-07,75031536,Yi Ling,"Clean private bedroom with shared bathroom and kitchen. Check in was easy and Nadia was prompt in her replies and accommodating when I asked if I could leave my luggage at her place before check in. 

Great & convenient location; oh & good coffee nearby!"

The host was also quick with her responses to any queries we had and even let us leave our luggage in the apartment after our check-out time.

The food available in the kitchen for breakfast was a nice touch and bus 28 just a few minutes walk from the place brings you straight to the golden gate bridge so it was really handy.

All in all definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to visit SFO!"

1277771,128953112,2017-01-28,110903827,Gloria,She is a super nice person helped us when we need to move the car so we wouldn't get a ticket and was always a quick to reasoned to our questions.
9435665,94007721,2016-08-14,62262736,Petrina,"Séjour passable! Maison typique et propre en dehors des poils de chien partout mais trop cher pour la prestation d'avoir juste une chambre sans rien en plus! Situé loin de la pluspart des endroits touristiques peu de restos et commerces vraiment dans le coin dommage!  A savoir que contrairement à l'annonce il y a deux autres chambres a louer dans la 
maison donc faut être plus vigilant ne sachant pas qui est vraiment présent pas de clef sur la porte pour se rassurer!"

4135201,234438232,2018-02-12,49656450,Richard,It had been a while since I'd been at David's house. It was as wonderful as I remembered it. Perfect location to go into the stylish Cole Valley neighborhood and David and Golf were perfect hosts (as was their dog Junebug!). I highly recommend David's place and will go again!

18012201,169778124,2017-07-13,103695977,Jared,Great efficient place right off 19th avenue close to public transit and restaurants. Basic and comfy 
258873,56505647,2015-12-14,43309235,Vanessa,The room was a a good base for our short stay in San Fran. The sheets were clean and the bed comfortable. Irina was always easy to communicate with and was very accommodating. Greg was friendly and accommodating in welcoming us in. If you're looking for a basic place to rest your head while touring San Fran. This one works well.  
14422371,266249032,2018-05-19,33127980,Alberto,Amazing place and extremely fast responses. We loved our stay!
21966135,306575913,2018-08-12,56577239,Jordan,Nice clean room hosts are cool friendly people
4614763,70963273,2016-04-22,44952004,John,Great place exceptionally clean and well-thought out.  Also fantastic neighborhood-- Dynamo coffee is the best donut in town no?  Thanks Del.
7922690,127242876,2017-01-16,31742078,Cindy,Exactly as advertised! Very clean home. The room is spacious and the bathroom is gorgeous. It is in a very quiet street so we had no problem sleeping at night. Would highly recommend staying here. 
7902889,196023143,2017-09-21,42673287,Adrian,"5* for the place location and host!
Mike's place was easily accessible from the Caltrain station at 4th & King St with just a 10 min ride or 20min walk. 
The apartment itself is located in a secluded and quiet street that is surrounded by a bustling neighbourhood (freeway is close-by and many large tech companies are in the surrounding blocks). 
Granted there was little to zero noise at night-time so you will snooze in peace. 
His place is clean spacious (even with large luggage) and stocked with all facilities and necessities (kitchenware shower towels and then some!).
I had the pleasure to be the first guest to test run the new sofa bed and huge TV - perfect combo for winding down a long-day of traversing the rolling hills of SF with a wide selection of the latest shows and movies available. :)

There are many sites to visit within walking distance of Mike's apartment and he'll be sure to give you top tips on the best local eateries to head to. 

Some of the surrounding sites - 
- Ferry Building (Marketplace + Good restaurants + Ferry to Sausalito)
- Views of Oakland bridge (best at night when the bridge is illuminated with a light show)
- Rincon Park (Food market on the weekends) 
- AT&T Stadium ( Baseball )
- SF Museum of Modern Art (5min Next block) 
- Yerba Buena Gardens
- SF City Hall
- Asian Art Museum
- Dragons Gate + Chinatown

Definitely recommend this place to people that want to get in the most of SF within walking distance of top sites and eats! :)"
16858141,292318773,2018-07-17,65842020,Liam,Amazing place to stay! Would come again! The house and rooms are lovely and clean and downtown SF is only 20 minute train away. 
31512417,531545328,2019-09-17,122626393,Abigail,Cosy spot in pretty and quite quiet neighbourhood
28722160,541710423,2019-10-05,101428856,小荣,房主人特别好对房客照顾地也很周到｡主动帮我们交金门大桥的过桥费因为租车公司交的话会很贵｡洗衣机和甩干机很好用让我们在他家好好休整了一下｡两张双人床一个单人床我们5个人住着刚好｡被褥非常舒服暖和｡所以向大家强力推荐他家!
7226841,51435728,2015-10-20,40308824,Liz,"Nads was fantastic she was really accommodating with my check in and out times and sent me really detailed instructions on how to get in without any problems. 
She was in contact with me before arrival sending me tips on the best way in which to get to her place from the airport and was in general beyond helpful. 
The location of her apartment was great central to anywhere in the city you could want to go and never waited more than a couple of minutes for an Uber or Lyft.
The room itself was clean and organized. It was well lit and the bed was super comfortable. She definitely makes you feel at home and is always happy to offer anything she can. 
Evie (her dog) is adorable and mostly keeps to herself. She was not a bother at all! 
All in all Nads was a fantastic host and should I return to SF I will be  back."
20256864,535184709,2019-09-23,3701166,Ilana,Pretty straight forward spot. Great if you just need a place to rest at night and move on.
350391,4491076,2013-05-08,1330207,Pauline,"We couldn't expect better stay in San Francisco than in Jeff and Jim place. They are adorable and prepare the breakfast with love every morning. Unfortunately we didn't find enough time to share more moments with them !
The house is incredible the view is incredible the room is furnished with vintage furniture it was perfect !

Thank you for welcoming us we will come back for sure.
You made our stay in San Francisco way more pleasant !

Pauline and Damien"

10840593,463175899,2019-06-02,237082882,Ramina,"A house is just a house but a warm and thoughtful host can make it a castle. Bill is very gracious warm and thoughtful. 
The location is perfect for anyone who is visiting SF and wants to stay in a place that's in the middle of everything."
30776488,546650420,2019-10-13,6808178,Michele,If you want a funky comfortable place right in the heart of it all  you will love the Red Victorian!
4252808,167679652,2017-07-07,103384767,Janine,Great location a bit out of downtown. It was Foggy most days...but it is San Francisco! Close to the Golden Gate Gardens and beach walks.
33578,135182937,2017-03-03,118757193,Chris,Great room with great communication an accuracy. Very beautiful secluded cottage in the city
19570849,301158013,2018-08-03,7029629,Akiko,Awesome place to stay in Miraloma Park neighborhood. 
1336998,70233010,2016-04-17,11760939,Claire & Antoine,"Superbe maison style victorienne cituée dans un beau quartier de San Francisco la maison est vraiment sympa et on s'y s'en vraiment bien!!! La chambre est superbe et aménagée avec beaucoup de goût.
Richard et Doug sont deux personnes formidables ils sont très ouverts et nous donnent plein de conseils utiles pour visiter San Francisco les chats sont sooooo friendly surtout Blu qui trop adorable
Allez-y les yeux fermés je recommande vivement ce lieu"
3311711,63934956,2016-02-28,25438253,Rachel,Though we didn't get a chance to meet in person we really enjoyed staying at Rye's place for one night. The rooms are clean and beautiful and he was very helpful in giving house rules/instructions/ making sure things were going well. I would definitely recommend it. :)
4519757,48235374,2015-09-24,44209956,Iryna,I like this hostel because it is really big and you can always find free bathroom or wait several minutes and there'll be one for you. Rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. There was only one problem about snoring people however hostel has nothing to do with that
208831,161912527,2017-06-18,26682339,Jacoba,Peter's place was the perfect location for exploring the city on foot- so close to everything! We stayed with our ten month old and the space worked well for us the living room was bigger than I expected with plenty of space for her to crawl around. Peter was a great host he met us on arrival and showed us around and after that he gave us full privacy. I would definitely recommend staying in Peter's apartment! 
17543814,533521522,2019-09-21,228249622,Mario,Great place to stay near the city as well as close to the airport for a short trip like I had ...
21710124,565731483,2019-11-17,82226207,Nathan,Paul was a wonderful host & had very thorough responses in a timely manner. He greeted us at the house & provided a tour. We had a surprised party planned there & had notified him of it beforehand (he was totally cool about it!) as long as the neighbors weren’t disrupted. The amenities & place was amazing. Definetely will rent again when we come back!
1434425,345353859,2018-11-04,19013714,Daniel,This is my second time staying with David and it was just as good as the first time. The location is quiet but still central enough to make the rest of the city very accessible. I would 100% recommend staying here.
1724819,240706797,2018-03-05,43540278,Mark,We had a fantastic time at Natasha’s. Her communication with us and the check in procedure was second to none. Fantastic place and a fantastic view. Highly recommended!
7367530,84760555,2016-07-09,57749222,Kellyn,The Bunkhouse was the perfect place to stay in San Francisco if you intend to be out and about all day and just need a place to sleep. It was very clean and the staff was very friendly. It is also in a great location. Very easy to get around. We would definitely stay again! 
28722160,347078687,2018-11-10,29415038,Rob,Great place easy to find close to Downtown and Airport.
10347570,322294606,2018-09-12,55068818,Tes,The unit is conveniently located (Muni bus 48 literally stops at your doorstep) and very clean. All the amenities you could need were provided full size toiletries and plenty of towels. The place was spacious and stylishly decorated. The Wi-Fi signal was strong and always available. Netflix was also available for guests. Vidhu is truly a Superhost. Above and beyond special touches were waiting for us. She really took note of what was important to me. Overall an excellent experience and good value for money. We would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend it to our friends.
1344752,51015469,2015-10-17,5672213,Anne-Marie,We appreciated having a place to stay that was centrally located. The apartment was clean with a great kitchen. Patti's house notes were clear which made letting ourselves in easy. Traveling as a family of 5 it can be challenging to find a place to stay. AirBnB is a great solution as we can find space and amenities that are helpful especially when traveling with small children. Having the use of a kitchen and washer and dryer is huge. We were a bit surprised to find a note on the washer saying that it was only for guests staying 2 days or longer since that was not on the listing. 
3689368,359719753,2018-12-17,226578301,Erika,It is a cozy home with heat comfortable beds clean items and a cat to welcome you there. Our only issues were with the shower as it was hard to figure out and the main door lock but besides that it provided everything we needed. The neighborhood also wasn't the prettiest but it was quiet nonetheless and calm.
25815864,536456748,2019-09-26,64267294,Gary,Great sty lovely easily house to find. Was driving so great parking on street right out front. Room was overly warm but had been over 100 all day so not surprising really.
657121,234459827,2018-02-12,4714866,Ellie,Trevor's place was AMAZING! We were visiting from LA and my parents couldn't stop ranting and raving about how it had every amenity they needed plus the views were above and beyond. We would end up wanting to come back from exploring just to hang out in the living room and take in the city views. We also felt very safe in the neighborhood and were able to walk to our dinner the first night. I would definitely recommend a family or group to stay here.
18464444,204168392,2017-10-16,130500,Marna,Chez Sanchez was incredibly comfortable and perfect for the four of us to enjoy being in the City together and attending a family wedding nearby. Every need was anticipated...we felt pampered. Very nice!
18107901,199979272,2017-10-03,21397492,Sanjay,I made a last minute reservation but was very impressed with Jeff's responsiveness. He was also very accommodating of unplanned schedule changes I had to make. Overall the property description was accurate. Also some good food options within a block. Thanks Jeff for a comfortable stay!
3205059,143204997,2017-04-10,60694469,T A,We rented Vera's studio for my in-laws and they had a wonderful stay in this well-appointed studio. My only concern is now that they've been spoiled staying in this cute place around the corner from our house they won't want to sleep on our pull-out couch again.  :o)  The place is as you'd expect from the description and pictures: cute comfortable close to public transportation and restaurants.  And Vera was a great host.  It was perfect! 
10500754,199727771,2017-10-02,82935658,Kun,Very good place and very nice host
2742151,17347471,2014-08-11,16290018,Kristen,Stacie was great! My boyfriend and I stayed at her place for the Outside Lands music festival which was a short bike ride from her house. We had the entire bottom floor to ourselves which was nice after spending all day at the festival. We didn't see too much of Stacie while we were there but she was still extremely helpful with any info we needed. She also has the sweetest little kitty who will come greet you in the morning! We would definitely stay here again for next years festival. Totally recommend!
2738331,117238254,2016-12-05,16641971,Diana,The listing is an in excellent location.  Close to many shops Golden Gate Park whole foods etc.  If you're expecting luxury style amenities this isn't necessarily your place.  Washer/Dryer is accessible but not freely available and host is not very responsive via text or airbnb message. 
13901641,262662603,2018-05-09,39373661,Natalie,This place is awesome! It’s in a very quiet and safe residential neighborhood. The room is big and comfortable. Guanying is a nice and responsible host that keeps the rooms clean and communicate with us well. Would highly recommend to other guests!
1578597,235734089,2018-02-17,3990921,Stacey,We enjoyed staying in this apartment the bed is super comfy and towels were of excellent quality.  Our only complaint was that we didn't know there were chickens living in the backyard - our dogs were so distracted by them they couldn't use the space.
12725886,359974623,2018-12-18,78959660,Mark,Wonderful room located within walking distance to UCSF medical center and across the street to the Golden Gate Park. Debbie and her husband were incredibly nice which made our stay that much more enjoyable.
256176,44139006,2015-08-24,19703322,Roger,Everything was fine. The room was as good or better than expected. The location was excellent for me. It waa near Golden Gate park and right on the main bus lines.
5007358,59172899,2016-01-07,52812199,Christian,Place was advertised. Neighborhood is a little rough but you're right next to downtown which is great. 
27937727,335307714,2018-10-11,3272028,Tam And Rhianna,Valentino's elegantly styled out house and rooms were a perfect place to explore San Francisco from.  The location is great walking distance to downtown Market and Union square and their is a tram right outside.  We particularly enjoyed our balcony overlooking the city and most comfortable bed.  Valentino was such a sweet and very interesting guest.  His tips for places to visit around the city where perfect and his stories so entertaining! Thanks for a lovely stay.
8739,8944956,2013-11-27,4330009,Jason,"It seems like every time i stay in an AirBnB property it just gets better and better.

I was so impressed and grateful to spend time in such an amazing home. I only got to meet Ivan Wendy & Milo at the start for a quick tour and key handover but it was obvious they are lovely trusting and accommodating people. They were especially gracious letting me keep my suitcase there after morning checkout until i came to collect it later in the afternoon.

This place is in such a wonderful and accessible location - literally right on the doorstep to one of San Francisco's 'happening' areas. It is full of wonderful natural light open spaces and tasteful furnishings.

I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks guys.
"
256176,39604962,2015-07-25,17062887,Cheryl,This little spot was fantastic! Once I worked out the bus routes it was easy to get into the city!! It was nice to have your own access into your room and having your own space. The host was fantastic and always quick with contact. Great airbnb and would recommend it!! 
15207940,541137951,2019-10-04,122423715,Avery,Super cute and easy to get there! First time in San Fran so didn’t spend much time at the place but it was perfect to just sleep at!
2486953,290101660,2018-07-13,76111200,Doran,"Beautiful space. Quiet and peaceful.

Vincent was a wonderful host!  Will stay again when in SF."
1633173,81234650,2016-06-21,56413704,Garrett,Nice private room with good accommodations
28181442,539180008,2019-09-30,283478395,Whitney,Thanks for the great hospitality! Our stay was perfect and the room had everything we needed and more! Yoram’s recommendations were very helpful and the breakfast spot he told us about was delicious. He were very accommodating to us. It was comforting knowing we had a safe and homey place to stay during our trip. We can’t wait to go back
2042095,417929794,2019-02-28,237457377,Nimish,We have stayed at Bruce and Lawrence's home for more than a month after arriving to SF . It was a great experience at their house and Bruce makes you feel welcome offers tips and advice for exploring the city and will go out of his way to make sure you feel at home .Sheets were clean towels provided and the WiFi worked great. Bert was really cute and my kid loved to play with him. I plan on reaching out to Bruce/Lawrence  next time I’m in the city and you should too! I could not have asked for a better experience !!!
19332338,291345635,2018-07-15,46666045,Jan,Great location parking right next door
6523507,115428929,2016-11-24,17568892,Jakki,I've been using Airbnb for over 3 years and Sebastian's cottage is by far and away the most beautiful — and unique — place I've stayed. The cottage is small but feels spacious due to the careful consideration of the design. Additionally most pieces have been handmade by Sebastian making the cottage feel extra speciaI. If you appreciate quality and finer details — stay here! My boyfriend and I feel blessed to have stayed in such a magical place.
548232,3577863,2013-02-18,5066498,Ron,"I visited from San Diego with my wife my 8-month old daughter and my brother.  This place was perfect for us for many reasons and we really enjoyed our stay:
-There is a crib in one bedroom which saved us the trouble of bringing our travel crib on the flight. 
-The Marina location is excellent for a visit with endless restaurants parks waterfront and shopping easily walkable (and not hilly at all as is much of SF).
-Denise lives upstairs and was extremely helpful with suggestions for things to do places to eat etc.
-We rented a car and there was ample street parking in the neighborhood.
-Washer/Dryer availability. 
-Having 2 bedrooms and a shared living/dining/kitchen was much better for us than a hotel as we could let the baby sleep while still hanging out together rather than ending our days at 6pm when the baby went to sleep. 

Would definitely recommend this place to SF visitors!"
4890230,229306271,2018-01-22,35037228,Lawrence,Lots of fun travelers stay here and it was good getting to hear everyone’s stories!! Really cool culture!
28696499,472475872,2019-06-19,179160839,Sayaka,Fa is very hospitable and communicative.  The room is sparkling clean and comfy. Easy access to public transport.
21727562,498466147,2019-07-29,153276625,Maria,Very nice host—he left us some carnations in the room—plenty of clean sheets and towels. Great location too.
20852099,261701151,2018-05-06,43277292,Hanna,Jean’s place is located in a quiet neighborhood. Super easy to get into the city with Uber. She is easy to communicate with and I enjoyed my stay!
31864519,427411199,2019-03-23,109746949,Gabrielle,"Joyce was great and her home is lovely. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay.  She provided all of the necessities: shampoo conditioner toothpaste extra blankets etc.  We were also free to use the kitchen and dining area. Overall 10/10! If we were to visit SF again in the future we would definitely stay at Joyce’s again! (Just so I can see her 2 doggies Zuko and Zelda too!) 

My only advice to future travelers: It is rather difficult to find parking starting after 7PM so it’s best to come home before 9PM!"
19491887,438881826,2019-04-17,22733068,Angel,"The space is exactly as described. Clean comfy and quiet for a good night sleep before exploring SF. The available parking space is a huge plus. Erica is very responsive and detailed. Her husband (Dennis I believe) helped us the first day.
Thank you so much"
150848,557293808,2019-10-31,240707396,Carla,"Nice neighborhood
Small clean room
Great host"
786506,38592189,2015-07-17,2443918,Bec,"Our time here was fantastic exactly what we were expecting from the description. Staff and guests were all great. The room was clean and beds were pretty comfortable. Great location super close to walk to buses and restaurants/bars. Although we had lots to do so didn't spend a lot of time hanging out in the common area when we did everyone was friendly :) 
We loved San Fran and would stay here again. "
14488234,414777933,2019-02-20,5501995,Miguel,One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed in. Jason and Jerrett are so friendly and welcoming. Their place is cozy and has been beautifully updated. I felt like I was staying at a luxury hotel they even provided a robe and slippers. Walking distance to the Castro neighborhood and plenty of shopping and food options around. Would definitely stay with them again.
6560870,530453239,2019-09-15,288546825,Zerlina,The apartment is exactly described and as in the photo. It was clean full of amenities cozy and Babs and Sage are super accommodating and responsive. For our stay they reached out to us in advance to check our arrival and parking needs which is much appreciated. We didn't drive but it was thoughtful to check. The apartment is 15 minutes away from  SFO. Babs greeted us at arrival and showed us around. They have everything you need and more than a hotel (tolietaries snacks tea & coffee tv & Hula books local tips charging station and endless stuff you might need and forgot to pack. It's like staying at a friend's home. We love it and can go on the details. If you are have any questions that are missing from the detail I am sure Babs and Sage will be very responsive and accommodating to the request. Thanks Babs & Sage.
6526129,106516909,2016-10-06,90070364,Julia,Amy was great - made sure she was available to answer any questions and make us feel welcome. The location is very trendy - tons of amazing restaurants shops & a grocery store right across the street!

8859249,270919653,2018-05-30,8006372,Tara,You will find a lovely space in a great location of San Fransisco.  Erika and Gary are wonderful hosts!
17622881,225505630,2018-01-06,145683717,Raphael,"Great place to crush from long days in San Francisco. 
You have to be aware that it takes its time to get into San Francisco from this location. Public transportation takes up to 1h to get into the City. I can recommend using Lyft or Uber its really cheap there. 
Other than that I had a great stay and the room was nice and modern. "
16975571,307140147,2018-08-13,31289059,Kyle,We stayed here for outside lands and the house couldn’t of been a better fit. It was quiet and the view was spectacular. I would definitely stay again
18107901,179126794,2017-08-06,26383399,Jordan,Jeff's place was perfect. Although we were paying for a private room they made us feel like the apartment was ours. They were very accommodating  and kept the room and bathroom very clean. I would definitely stay here again.
15812013,197999263,2017-09-27,52450181,Pj,Great location view and host. One of best Airbnb experiences I have had
1393654,85071570,2016-07-10,52978441,Jeff,Kevin is a really kind and knowledged and shared some fantastic stories with us. We didn't really have a plan and Kevin's introduction to SF helped a lot. He made a great start for our honeymoon trip in the States. Though a bit far from downtown would still recommend his house. 
12437037,84901663,2016-07-09,25346287,Ryan,Sandy was very quick to reply. The space is cozy and cute. The bed is comfy with comfy pillows. Our experience was smooth with no issues. We had a flight later I that evening and she was nice enough to allow us to leave our bags in the garage after checkout to explore the city. It's no wonder her place is always booked. Would stay again.
3081560,25751556,2015-01-25,14541803,Nicki,This location was a wonderful experience! The picture doesn't even give justice to how quaint spacious this victorian home is. The private suite was perfect. My boyfriend and I were looking for something private near the Mission our favorite neighborhood in San Francisco. Tons of great shops restaurants and Dolores park is near by. Amy was a great host very friendly and accommodating. Once our initial meet and greet we had barely bumped into her or her family. We felt very comfortable at their space. Never heard a peep from children in the morning as well. Highly suggest this spot! 
1043282,257596802,2018-04-26,23003994,Rachel,I stayed at John’s home for 5 nights. I did not want to leave. Great room comfy warm bed beautiful appointed home and easy to get around. Bus stops on Danvers St which is 20 metres from the house. Do yourself a favour and stay here.
7247746,107469042,2016-10-10,71548969,Danielle,"As described the house is 2 blocks from the beach where many of the neighbors spent their mornings surfing. Cafes just down the street were convenient spots for brunch or teleworking. Maite and Roger were very friendly and welcoming. They were very responsive when I messaged them. 

Living at the house was convenient because the front door and my guest room were locked by key code so I didn't have to worry about a key. 

All three guest rooms were filled during my stay which was great for getting advice and having travel companions. But there were 2 bathrooms with showers so I never had to wait on anyone to use the bathroom. 

Yes it's a bit of a trek from downtown but the N tram is right down the block
and you're guaranteed a seat! "
909063,154012242,2017-05-22,100463538,Alexandra,"Das Zimmer ist geräumig und mit dem typischen Charme der alten venezianischen Häusern in SF. Das Haus ist 2 Geminuten von der Bartstation entfernt. Auch mit dem Bus ist es überhaupt kein Problem die Station befindet sich direkt um die Ecke.
Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und Rafael und Mark waren extrem hilfsbereit. Wenn ich etwas brauchte konnte ich sie jederzeit kontaktieren. Ich würde auf jeden fall wieder bei ihnen wohnen!!!"
2123469,32703087,2015-05-20,23229974,Lujun,Staying at Viviane's house is a wonderful experience. We never met Viviane in person but she responded to our messages very promptly. The governor Cory is really caring and always makes sure we have all the information about neighborhood and transportation. Milo (the dog) is super friendly. The house is spacious clean and cozy. The neighborhood is nice and has many great restaurants. Will definitely stay again! 
1290935,8998210,2013-12-01,3229209,Cody,We had a wonderful time in Sarah's home!  The house is easy to find and get to has absolutely amazing views and comfortably fit our family for four nights.  We were pleased to have parking available as well as a kitchen well stocked with appliances to cook with. My son absolutly loved the kids' play area - we could hardly tear him away!  The home is also walking distance from the Randall Children's Museum which is a great place for young families. We would highly recommend this home for any families staying in the SF area and would gladly stay again!  Note - this home does have VERY steep stairs so it is not a good place for people who struggle with stairs.  We were concerned our crawling 7 month old might discover them but it turned out to be a non issue as there was so much else for her to safely explore. 
21596397,231774640,2018-02-02,105389911,Katlin,Wonderful place to stay. Great location with a beautiful view. Walking distance to nearby grocery stores and parks otherwise public transportation was close and easy to use. The host was very friendly I even texted her a few times with questions about the city and she replied immediately. Thanks!
3718865,28207913,2015-03-20,27065143,Jeff,Katie was super friendly and this downstairs apartment was very comfortable and spacious! Really enjoyed our time in San Francisco - thank you Katie for all the great recommendations and the hospitality!

Hello Josh
Thank you very much for everything. I found myself very comfortable in your home. Quiet comfortable and very complete and very clean which I value highly. Next time I'd come with my family. I hope it's possible."
3325741,218003637,2017-12-10,50223836,Julio,First things first the view you get is beautiful! I was greeted by Juan Carlos who quickly gave me a tour which consisted of showing me the bathroom and the bedroom I would be staying in. I never went into the living room nor anywhere else. I strictly only went into the room I way staying in and the bathroom. The walk through the neighborhood is really nice. 15 minutes to Castro st and about 35-40 minutes to Haight and about 30-35 to mission district. All in all I loved the location the hosts' were very nice and the two pups were always nice to see while coming in the door. Would definitely recommend and would absolutely stay with Juan Carlos and Robert again!
749744,105937760,2016-10-03,8086756,Matthias,Fine appartement in a nice neighborhood. The contact with Camille was very good. We had a great time Haight Ashbury and San Francisco! Thanks a lot!
18397875,262414252,2018-05-08,21895440,聪,"Anjna has a stylish and cozy place. Although we arrived bit late due to traffic jam we still self checked in successfully and smoothly. 
The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The sunset at the beach is absolutely beautiful. We really enjoyed the stay."
18396762,168640692,2017-07-09,136425919,Kaicheng,"This is a place you can see golden gate bridge from window.
This is a place equipped with a super pro kitchen have tons of spices.
Food already prepared food market is also close around.
Very nice neighborhood they will help. "
4093807,211855781,2017-11-14,83034202,Lukáš,Jeannie and Skate are simply amazing. Incredibly friendly and caring. Their house is just lovely super clean and has a WONDERFUL garden with the best view. 100% recommended!
2578122,94611845,2016-08-16,332615,Julia,This is a great place for exploring SF and all it has to offer. The location is perfect and the house is spacious with a shared bathroom between two rented out rooms. Brian is very communicative as host and was very quick to respond to our initial queries which were resolved quickly in a very generous and thoughtful manner. I didn't get to meet Brian in person but he seems like a very friendly and fair guy! 
10747219,203835351,2017-10-15,127214185,Brian,Prime location and a great place to stay for a trip to SF. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay.
16700935,331481452,2018-10-02,47589478,Jeff,Jeff’s place is your own private hideaway! Super clean & super cool. You feel a great comfort tucked away in this very private suite. A great outdoor patio/yard with fire pit for lounging. And nothing beats the location! A beautiful quiet neighborhood with awesome small local restaurants bars & coffee shops just at the corner of the block. Also located down the street from the up & coming Dog Patch area illuminated by hip industrial spots with local SF breweries & more great restaurants & nightlife. Easily accessible to the major freeway as well as the T Line light rail that takes you directly downtown. Jeff’s is an awesome spot to stay during your trip to the magic of San Francisco.

21011508,438456420,2019-04-16,11817261,Alexey,It was a great place to stay by far better than expected. Michael was truly a super-host. We even had wine waiting for us when we arrived. The place is close to many sights and the ocean as well. Highly recommended.

12741695,104181929,2016-09-25,37141802,Jack,"Staying at David's place was great. He was super communicative throughout the process and very welcoming. Being in the Outer Sunset was a perfect location for us- close to where we needed to be; quiet and mellow. And only blocks to the beach which is always great! 
And the starfield projector he has in the studio is the best way to fall asleep!  "
4663060,233028434,2018-02-07,131792503,Brian,Great price especially for the location. The place is as advertised.
23568246,419760498,2019-03-04,36633430,Suzanne,A great place in a really nice neighborhood- quiet and close to lots of stuff and public transportation. 24th Street is close and s really fun with some great restaurants - you will be eating out and why not?!
22110217,431383885,2019-03-31,110707351,Mario,Good place to stay if you’re visiting SF!
1482273,110988334,2016-10-29,44193712,Tom,"This is a beautiful apartment in a really lovely neighbourhood in SF (quiet enough that it is peaceful for sleeping but with a great range of shops & restaurants a block away). The apartment itself is really spacious and extremely well presented & maintained throughout. It has a homely feel and is clearly well loved. 

The amenities are fantastic: we particularly enjoyed soaking in the big Victorian tub in the main bathroom and the huge oven/gas jobs made cooking dinner a real pleasure. 

Mason was very communicative throughout and quick to provide thoughtful gestures (such as an extra umbrella when heavy rain was forecast). Mason lives nearby so also suggested restaurants in the area several of which we tried & found to be excellent. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and hope to come back again soon."
3832296,338910966,2018-10-20,60227857,Arnold,Great place. Location is great just outside all the greatest areas of San Fran. Very clean and lots of space. Bed was super comfy. Would recommend this place to anyone going to stay in the San Fram area!!

3759368,55534351,2015-12-01,38555113,Eric,This is a great apartment with a great location. The listing is both very descriptive and accurate. I never actually saw or met Leo but he stayed in touch through email/text and quickly responded to any question I had. I really didn't have any questions though because he anticipated all of them. He provided easy to follow instructions for things like how to check-in and how to operate the heating which weren't self-explanatory. I would definitely rent this apt again and recommend this host!
21623314,337841013,2018-10-17,9337873,Lars,Helpful and sociable hosts but not excessively so. Very quiet room and comfortable bed. I was very happy with my stay and plan to stay there again next time I'm in SF.
870705,465389399,2019-06-07,11653116,Hannah,Daniel's place is comfy and cozy. Two bedrooms made it great for two people to stay comfortably. The place was clean well equipped and quiet!

12115392,82168364,2016-06-26,35110332,Chelsea,Really great spot! The room was nice and the garden view was even better. Ethan is super kind and made the experience great. The location itself could use some upgrades the building is dated and has a little bit of a funky smell. But all in all I really enjoyed it and it was really fair pricing for the area.
1510363,421151363,2019-03-08,106301155,Peer,Tedd and Charlesie are fantastic hosts. They are very kind and we enjoyed talking with them. They even provided delicious food and drinks
1109534,567503052,2019-11-22,272833769,Sid,I’m hesitate to leave this review. Selfishly I want to keep this location all to myself. This is the best location in SF and the house is perfect. We walked to just about everything and getting downtown was quick and easy. We will be back next year that is if no one steals my perfect location in SF.
14548497,491090847,2019-07-19,216445374,Lukas,Nice spacious room in a very good location. Everything was as described and well prepared. Only the freeway close by was loud at night. The shared bathroom is very basic but was clean all the time. Communication with Lisa was also very good.
19721174,300697142,2018-08-02,188604100,Debbie,Amazing personal touches.  Clean. Great location.  Loved it!
35343196,523934107,2019-09-04,12954419,Robin,This place was exactly as described and perfectly clean. It is a bit far from downtown but the location is across the street from the park and just a few blocks from the beach. The hosts even provided a bottle of wind and a bar of chocolate to welcome us.
10858096,137340606,2017-03-14,117545579,Matthew,Great place location was fantastic.  Close enough to all major sights and attractions but still had a neighborhood feel with plenty of options for shopping and dining in close proximity.  Would definitely recommend.

1778650,354134907,2018-11-30,33684471,Maria,"Apartment is in a great neighborhood. Quick walk into GG park or to Balboa corridor. 

Super responsive. Whenever supplies were low we contacted Luda and she replenished them within the hour!"
1206233,86857580,2016-07-17,3226034,Tessa,Very hospitable and gracious hosts. Location was fantastic - Haight is a quirky neighbourhood that is near the Golden Gate Park. It's easy to get around with Whole Foods round the corner as well. Rooms are intimate wifi is good. We arrived with our car late one evening and couldn't find parking; Ashir got up to move his car in order for us to park in the driveway. He also ensured that we were able to move out of the driveway when we eventually left. 
28182735,334339510,2018-10-08,218644054,William,Great location and great amenities

3309722,207228640,2017-10-28,80233282,Jeff,A lovely home in a great neighborhood!  We watched the sun come up over Bernal Hill each morning sitting on the rooftop patio.  Everything was great and Cliff checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Would stay here again for sure.
21385697,419322334,2019-03-03,145614510,Dileesh,Keisha's place is very clean and spacious. The check-in/checkout process is autonomous and hence flexible. The neighbourhood can be a bit loud in the evening if you are walking about on the streets. Didn't have any unpleasant experiences and I did wander about during late hours (after 10 PM) - not that I recommend it:) Keisha was always in communication and very responsive. Will certainly consider this place for any future trips to SFO.
568161,22142763,2014-10-31,20679172,Agnes,Great place to stay great location very easy to get to all sight seeing places safe neighborhood Beth and Don are great hosts too wonderful stay

3082327,19194216,2014-09-08,9670244,Amy,This was such a sweet relaxing perfect place to stay for one!  Simon and his wife were very gracious and hospitable.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe and it was so easy to find parking.  The room is very clean and just like it looks in the photos.  The hosts provided a mini fridge with bagels toast and the fixings as well as bottled water tea and coffee.  My only regret is that I did not book it sooner for my next trip to SF because it is already booked.  I would stay here again and again.  Thank you Simon!
4122671,30247550,2015-04-19,21132961,Linda,Kerry was a great host. She was attentive and organized. The room was set up with all the necessities. In addition to that she provided us with a cool map of Dog Patch and surrounding neighborhoods that I took as a memorabilia. The location was convenient only a hop skip and a jump away from the MUNI trail. Overall it was a great stay. 
22325200,262674004,2018-05-09,32187263,Martin,We were two couples visiting SF for the first time.  Wayne’s place was perfect for our usage.  We had two vehicles easy to park in the streets.  A couple of blocks to the beach was very appreciated too.
5852066,331092204,2018-10-01,97713097,Shawn,Great place. You really can’t beat the location. Street parking is tough to find but free during the weekend. I only wish there had been some coffee in the unit but there were a number of options within a short walk.
12026856,101325370,2016-09-12,9254290,Maarten,Maria is a great host that makes you feel really welcome. The location is great and downtown is easily accessible via public transport. Altogether a great place to stay.
845480,271602880,2018-06-01,171968999,Tapojyotee,This place is a good value for money. It is however in a residential neighborhood and at a bit of a distance from shops and restaurants. Check in was pretty smooth. Stay was comfortable. I would consider Delores's place the next time I am here.
30502421,459016768,2019-05-26,189344501,Xiaoxing,Very nice loft and very welcoming hosts ;) My family and I enjoyed our stay here. Convenient neighborhood. Cool design. Thank you very much for the accommodation!
3309722,84651533,2016-07-08,48903516,Kurve,Very nice neighbourhood. Great views of the city. Comfortable .  But lacking a personable touch . Still a few things that need attention like the bathroom and kitchen plumbing and the refrigerator could be defrosted or upgraded. In the end it was a greAt place to launch into the rest of the city but a hotel would have been cheaper and offering more services.
28764476,464907720,2019-06-06,2442976,Greg,Fadi was an excellent host.  His place is sparkling clean.  I would definitely stay again.
5932678,193760170,2017-09-14,7228493,Robbie,Jaz's apartment was perfect for my stay in SF. Walking distance to nice restaurants and my office and also a great spot to set off and explore other areas of SF.

My two-day trip was for attending a conference so I did not ask for any recommendation in the neighborhood."
4948340,569201117,2019-11-25,24624887,Farrah,Budi’s place was really easy to get to and check in was super easy! He was very friendly and welcoming thanks Budi!
280673,2073394,2012-08-23,2945851,Lily,This place is cute and has direct sunlight in the bedroom which is a real treat in SF. Shani is a thoughtful and kind host and has set up the room with everything you might need for your stay; plenty of closet space a mirror shelves... There is a great cafe on the corner with wifi and yummy food. The apartment is close to the J train and a short walk to the 24th BART Station. I had a great time staying here! 
17753503,360791834,2018-12-21,201861458,Julie,Great place! Easy to let myself in which was great and the bed was super comfortable. Thank you!
12511163,98746423,2016-09-01,35768265,Monish,Very secluded place with amazing access to all the things you should start off with if visiting San Fran first time.
997382,202533135,2017-10-11,45772688,Brendan,Small room good value for this area. Room and house were very clean. Nice restaurants nearby. Parking was an enormous pain but I suppose that is to be expected for SF. Was able to find free spot for the first night but after that had to move car for street cleaning and ended up having to park in a paid lot. Walls were paper thin and could hear person in adjacent room snoring. Host was very responsive and allowed me to check in early when I arrived in town sooner than expected. Would certainly recommend to future travellers so long as you're not a light sleeper.
14450414,127870196,2017-01-21,3671922,Kum Hong,This listing has a fantastic location in the Mission located just off 24th and close to restaurants cafes etc. Jesse was a really good host he allowed me to check-in early and also was very understanding when I had to change my travel plans. The apartment itself is comfortable and clean and had everything I needed. Would definitely stay here again!

748256,329790290,2018-09-29,20616350,Michael,Yesica & Michael are experienced well-travelled and super friendly hosts. They made the communication before arriving very easy and the arrival itself smooth. We got lots of great and valuable sightseeing tips and the accommodation was as described. The room was clean and nice (a bit noisy though so take earplugs) and the location perfect for sightseeing the Mission. It takes you between 15 to 30 minutes into downtown depending on your choice of transport. All in all highly recommended :) 
1001759,61769325,2016-02-08,44130796,Gillian,Great location near Castro/Castro muni station. 3 Blocks away from the hustle and bustle of Castro and 2 blocks from groceries. A quite and nice apartment perfect for someone who just needs a place to stay for a short/long term. House has everything you need while you stay and great that they also have a washer.
16017966,274259694,2018-06-08,31048384,Florencia,"Joao’s place is amazing! Convenient place in the heart of the city. Awesome coffee shops and restaurants around the block. Spacious place and complete facilities.

Thanks joao well be back when were back in SF"
4959980,45148817,2015-08-31,40039906,Michael,"I was very pleased with my stay in Tali's apartment.  The apartment was large spacious and immaculate.  The host thoughtfully left many items for guests to use such as a hot water machine and herbal tea.  Bathroom was clean.  Host was friendly and willing to help when I needed him.  The only downside was a little bit of noise in the early morning from the kids upstairs but that really didn't bother me.

This apartment  is ideal for Orthodox Jews.  It is only half a block away from the synagogue and a separate entrance guarantees that there are no ""yichud"" problems."
17592480,300280423,2018-08-01,28358662,Howard,Al and Tiff were great hosts very nice to chat with and made sure we had everything we needed. Downtown is just an easy Uber/Lyft ride away definitely would recommend staying here for a visit to San Francisco! 
20762414,512754125,2019-08-18,89979831,Philip,A really spacious and well appointed first floor apartment with off road parking.  Nadya was a great host and the comfortable apartment had lots of nice touches to make us really welcome.  The location was great for public transport into the city and for local shops.  We had a great 4 days exploring San Francisco on bikes by foot bus boat and car.  Recommend guests get an online Muni pass for transport.$5 for unlimited buses and trains $12 if you want to include the cable cars.
14268636,99707921,2016-09-05,91842780,Angelina,Jack was a great host! Fun experience for my first time in the San Francisco area.
9225,438089072,2019-04-15,8686442,Sergio,La estadía fue tal cual lo planificado. El alojamiento se encuentra bien ubicado dentro de la ciudad tanto para moverte en auto como caminando.
3877462,265941993,2018-05-18,8052324,Cassi,5 stars. The apartment is spacious clean decorated well and perfect for any kind of traveler business or pleasure. It's situated in Potrero Hill a quiet neighborhood with easy access to the Mission and SoMa. Carly and her husband were perfect hosts: responsive courteous and accommodating. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and plan to make more use of the roof deck next time with its incredible view of the city.
26624972,503272746,2019-08-05,30145581,Evan,This is a nice place right by the beach.  The house is perfect for families with kids.  Amy is a great host who goes out of her way to help you out with whatever you need.
4782281,333728931,2018-10-07,4967965,Allison,Daniel’s place is a perfect location. It is a cozy and clean guest space with a nice deck. It is definitely suitable for some but not all. The lock on deck door didn’t work and it felt strange having our toddler sleep in a room that we couldn’t lock. The walls are very thin and if you are a light sleeper you will hear the neighbors kid crying and banging on a piano at 6:45am no joke. Otherwise the bed was comfortable enough and we really loved the location.
12437037,230693179,2018-01-28,69976291,Rachel,Definitely recommend!
19140351,231593080,2018-02-01,170465371,Stephanie,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

3354928,199710536,2017-10-02,73659507,Carlos,"My family and I had a wonderful time in San Francisco. The house was exactly what we needed: good location close to most of the different local destinations and easy to get around.
It is a beautiful apartment perfect for 4 people. Instructions were easy to follow and Tan was available for us to solve our questions."
545685,415455467,2019-02-22,226845376,Patrice,This place is so cute! It’s close to everything yet offers the quiet comfort you need to relax after a busy day. The place is small yet so spacious at the same time. Su is extremely easy to communicate with. We loved this space!
23615779,463060171,2019-06-02,60505684,Claude,"Xin is helpful  and reacts quickly to the demands.  Be careful the address on the site is not the right one.
The flat is in the basement next to the garage and lacks light. You can't sit in the kitchen. There's no table. On the whole too expensive for what you get."
4624467,457672226,2019-05-24,66632758,Nathan,The place was actually way bigger than I expected. We utilized all spaces throughout the week. The kitchen is great!

The location is great and the living area is clean and spacious. Igor is a great host and went above and beyond to make sure we have everything we need. Thank you Igor!!!
501770,50464603,2015-10-12,16302928,Stacy,Listing was totally accurate.  Apartment was clean beautiful and thoughtfully appointed.  Access code made it easy to come and go vs. pesky keys which can get misplaced.
748256,2871881,2012-11-12,618091,James,This was my first stay on Airbnb and I have to say it was a great experience!  The location was perfect right in the heart of the Mission with easy access to bars restaurants and transit.  Michael and Yesica were very helpful answering any questions that I had.  The room was comfortable and well appointed.  I would highly recommend Michael and Yesica’s place to anyone coming to San Francisco!

28459015,450992210,2019-05-10,32001541,Anne,"Sehr sichere Gegend Parkplätze sind kostenlos vorhanden und die Lage ist auch gut. Mit dem Bus oder der Bahn fährt man ca. 40 Minuten zu beliebten Touristenorten. Die Station ist keine 5 Minuten von der Unterkunft entfernt.
Das Zimmer ist sehr schön gestaltet das Badezimmer sehr groß. Es gibt genügend Handtücher und einen Föhn. 
Kann diese Unterkunft nur empfehlen. Wir kommen nächste Woche deshalb wieder. Vielen Dank"

3506164,65113639,2016-03-10,28251635,Joshua,The apartment is great. It is well take for and has a beautiful garden in the front. Throughout the attentions from the hosts were good and everything was very comfortable from WiFi and TV to the keyless doors.

77175,184411396,2017-08-19,99623057,Emma,Alaa was a lovely host and a great chef. The Syrian cuisine I learnt to cook was delicious will definitely try to recreate it at home. I came as a solo traveler and it was like having a dinner party with old friends a great night. 
3672198,58191523,2016-01-01,1626112,Tarpan,Great location clean and easy access to lots of great SF sights.  Lots of stuff within walking distance and the bus/trolley/street car stops are all within a few blocks.  Manu is also very responsive and easy to communicate with.  Would definitely recommend. 
14671675,246073635,2018-03-24,3662702,Ken,Excellent location close to 16th street BART station and very quiet at night.  Clean room great host would recommend.

I love the feeling of living in a home just like you live with your family. They are very nice people and really care for you."
29906769,554143783,2019-10-25,88343741,Linda,Very clean and updated space. The hosts were super nice to work with and recommended several things nearby for us to do. Loved the location by the park and the Golden Gate Bridge! Parking was tough. We recommend taking the bus and not moving your rental car as much as possible because it’s hard to find parking on the street at night. We would definitely stay there again. Good value and location!
631635,4768060,2013-05-25,4671225,Heather,Betty's flat is in a perfect location with an amazing view! We had a great stay and were so glad we stayed here. We would definitely recommend it to others! 
5272750,427052511,2019-03-22,12898202,Daniel,Had a great full week stay here. Few things to note.... It was busy so there were long lines for the showers every morning. A bit frustrating if you have somewhere to be! The drawers under the beds to keep stuff in fall down and slam easily so I recommend a lock for those. Otherwise the slamming might wake you up at night. Did enjoy my stay and plenty to do nearby!
26261610,499616653,2019-07-31,274341289,Toby,Clean comfortable and private single bedroom. Thanks for sharing your home.
5068486,32524130,2015-05-19,11940385,Laura,Karen was the most thoughtful and considerate host ever! The apartment is exactly how it appears in the photos and is appointed above and beyond your typical Airbnb rental. Being former natives of the West Portal neighborhood it's home to us and is a wonderful area of SF with muni lines an easy walk away. 
20885900,433564240,2019-04-06,98443473,Iris,It’s great staying with Heather. Everything is great the location the beautiful room and thoughtful notes everywhere :)

1655446,178123699,2017-08-04,15707512,James,I booked my mother sister and mother-in-law to stay here while my wife and I were at another airbnb around the corner. They had a wonderful stay at Jessica's beautiful home. It is a gorgeous house and it's a great location - a quiet street just a couple of minutes' walk from all the buzz of Valencia Street. They loved it!
964751,101363208,2016-09-12,92728797,Sunanda,We loved our stay at Phil's little studio located at a very convenient location to the bus stops. The description listed in the site was accurate.  Phil's binder with information was very helpful. There were a lot of guide books and maps that helped us plan our visits. The kitchen was fully equipped with utensils. I loved the little garden by the room. Phil was kind enough to come meet us and help us with all the questions we had. if we visit SFO again we would love to stay at Phil's place.
3311711,499638893,2019-07-31,273386912,성민,채광이 잘되고 식물이 많아 머물기에 멋진 장소 입니다. 집주인 분이 친절하게 대해주시고 샌프란시스코에 여행에 대해서도 추천을 잘 해주셨습니다. 다른 나라의 문화에 대해 대화하는걸 좋아하신다고 소개되어 있는데 여행중이시라면 이런 시간을 가지는 것도 즐거운 경험이 되는 것 같습니다.
1767543,30473050,2015-04-22,24195453,Edmundo,La casa era todo lo que esperábamos. Excelente ubicación limpia y cómoda. Sin duda la recomiendo a futuros viajeros que quieran estar en el centro de San Francisco.
14125,9247673,2013-12-16,3685342,Jason,Fantastic apartment (With incredible art on the walls…I wanted to take all of it home) in a very convenient location.

15621583,150396841,2017-05-07,618352,Pri,"the pictures don't do the apartment justice! we loved our stay and hope to return. every detail from the towels to the coffee to the water pressure in the shower was perfect. bruce was communicative and wonderful from beginning to end. we were sad to leave - especially our 3 year old who thinks it is our apartment and keeps saying he wants to go back to ""santa frisco."""

6119683,51594246,2015-10-21,16395538,Vanessa,Dino is friendly and precise. The neighborhood is very noisy so remember to bring your ear plugs.  Since you are in the mission great coffee shops and restaurants are near by. The house is clean and accurate as the photographs show.  We told him about a weird smell there was in the room he was going to take care of it. He has amazing cleaners so the overall house is clean.  
12522,21069742,2014-10-11,12770718,Stephanie,I enjoyed  the time at Brenda very much. I liked my room. It is small but it fits except for someone really tall or big. The position in the Castro is splendid. Interesting neighborhood nice stores bars and restaurants. Brenda and her roommate are very helpful and friendly persons and you can come with every question. I would like to keep in touch. 
6481492,249088480,2018-04-01,43640762,Jennifer,Really enjoyed staying here. Perfect for our family of 4--close to BART and buses. Master bed was really comfortable. The parking was really helpful for us since we were going up to Point Reyes for a daytrip--but I would suggest that most people just use public transport and Uber for the city. Very nice kitchen and excellent knives/pans etc. The Mission area was really fun to walk around--had excellent Latin American food a few times. Felt very safe walking around.
4888308,408201591,2019-02-03,3647198,Raymond,Maya and Brian’s Noe flat was a cozy and comfortable place for us to house family visiting from out of town for a weekend. It is a very good value considering the location and that it has beds for 5 in two bedrooms which was ideal for a family with 3 young kids. It is also nice that Brian and Maya live nearby in case any questions come up.
21068061,307584424,2018-08-14,176578990,Henning,Eine geräumige Wohnung mit allem ausgestattet was man bracht incl. Gschirrspüler Waschmaschine Trockner. Direkt neben dem Haus gibt es eine kleine Stiege die direkt zur Bushaltestelle der Linien 9 und 8 führt. Mit denen ist man sehr schnell und umsteigefrei in der Stadt. WLAN funktioniert und wir haben  uns einfach die MUNI Appp für San Francisco heruntergeladen damit ist auch das Bezahlen ein Kinderspiel. 90 min für 250 und die Kinder zahlen die Hälfte! Wir können es nur empfehlen! Dank für die gute Zeit.

144978,1819598,2012-07-28,2621743,Linda,Jay was a welcoming host.  Her home is basic yet clean.  She offered help when I asked.
14553693,218057046,2017-12-10,334495,Chris,This is my second stay at Syds AirBnb and it is exactly as it was the first time perfection!  The location is perfect a quick walk to the Muni train to go downtown and a nice walk to the Castro to get on the old Muni trains.  We spent a couple nights down on the waterfront enjoying the Liberty Ship tour classic arcade and North Beach (Little Italy) for amazing food.  Amazing coffee is right down the street along with excellent BBQ.  The space that Syd and Rosa provide is so beautiful and comforting.  Amazing linens bathroom and such a peaceful tranquil setting in their backyard.  This is my goto spot to stay in San Francisco whenever I am in town for business or pleasure.
13774014,535157472,2019-09-23,221104246,Art,A lovely modern and clean apartment to stay in. Great host communication. Would definitely recommend
4105892,179550073,2017-08-07,18032425,Haizi,"The room is attractive for the musical instruments and other interesting stuff. There's a large beautiful patio out of the room. If you're sitting there and have a cup of tea you can see the vast stretch of the city below the hill. Great scenes!

However the public area (kitchen washer/dryer corridor etc) is not clean. Needs some improvement on this."
5696895,80522768,2016-06-18,43352073,Michael,Claudio was a very warm friendly and accommodating host! The space was perfect: clean private and had everything we needed for our week stay in SF. We would stay again any time!

Would definitely recommend. Slightly out of the main centre of SF which was nice.

They were so accommodating and helpful on providing us with advice and we felt extremely comfortable! 

Thanks Jennifer and Dan!!!"
470686,43423592,2015-08-19,39248661,Randy,Hao was very welcoming and his place was very modern and clean.  I enjoyed staying there.  Close to many restaurants and supermarkets.  BART was a 5 minute walk.  Room was quiet so sleeping was easy.
238190,131908926,2017-02-14,107868510,Mic,Bill's home is well positioned for Fishermans Wharf and Union St food places. It is well appointed and welcoming. Unlike some Airbnb you really are staying in a homely place appointed with luxury trimmings and there's personality in every room. Bill is very responsive and prepared with an excellent welcome guide. He is also a great conversationalist but offers privacy too. I enjoyed my stay.
4526608,52074599,2015-10-26,43739285,Jody,The bed was super comfortable and I slept really well.  Nice lounge chair for reading.  Honestly I was glad no one else was staying so I had the bathroom to myself.  She provided lots of help with my getting lost in the city and getting around.  Enjoyed my first Airbnb experience.
9882716,159056569,2017-06-09,105296836,Yiu Lam,A very spacious clean quiet and comfortable home with cooking and laundry facilities. A bit out of town but only 20' easy and level walk to Union Square. Bus stops close by and you will find grocery and liquor stores in  neighbouring Howard Street. Lovely and gracious hosts. No security issues.
379349,4315080,2013-04-27,5339400,Trevor,My girlfriend and I recently stayed with Miriam and we couldn't have had a better experience. Miriam was always quick to respond flexible with check-in times and ensured we had everything we need. The location truly can't be beat. Right in the heart of Haight-Ashbury and extremely close to the MUNI that gets you everywhere you need to go. We only met Miriam in person very briefly but all of our dealings with her were delightful. Would return in a heartbeat!  
1614453,97326592,2016-08-26,23705305,Aleksandra,Great location - walking distance to main touristic attraction of SF. The room was specious great for the family of 4. The hotel was overall clean and nice - highly recommened for short stays.

4993804,62498145,2016-02-15,241154,John,Wow. Greg's home is beautiful. My family stayed at his house for a few days over my wedding weekend and it provided a super comfortable sanctuary for them (and me) amongst the madness of the weekend. The neighborhood is also great - close proximity to great restaurants a grocery store and anything else you may need for your family. Last it was super kid friendly as well.

La chambre est très agréable bonne literie salle de bain très jolie avec de bons produits à disposition. Carol avait prévu notre arrivée tardive en nous laissant les clés à disposition.
Nous avions même des petites attentions qui nous attendaient dans la chambre. Je recommande cette chambre privée."
2047469,13361479,2014-05-26,14648319,Ash,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time in San Francisco thanks to Kenix and her lovely BnB. I thought the photos online were beautiful and I'm pleased to say that the rooms themselves are just as beautiful as advertised. I felt safe and comfortable in my room which was a blessing as I was traveling alone for the first time. 

The living room in addition to being a comfortable place to unwind contained numerous brochures and maps that helped guide my solo adventure and I appreciated that Kenix took the time to walk me through the different local entertainment options and even helped explain the bus system to me. 

When I return to San Francisco in the future I hope I can snag a room here again!"
1106534,30555489,2015-04-24,29062115,Nicholas,Rachel is a wonderful host. So many little details were taken care of to make us feel welcome during our stay and she was very responsive whenever we needed to communicate. The cottage was also more spacious than we expected.

3122882,78914489,2016-06-10,19867910,Mary Claire,We had a wonderful time meeting Kara and staying at her beautiful house. Kara welcomed us warmly and was easy to talk with. There were fresh flowers and homemade cookies in our clean and well-decorated room. She has thought of everything! The bed was comfortable with a nice view of the green back yard. It was easy to come and go on our own schedule. It was the perfect place for our one night in San Francisco and we wished we could have stayed longer.

It was very clean when we arrived and had many amenities available. Fresh towels electric stove bottled water in the rooms and fruit and tea in the common area. 
18488036,476695112,2019-06-26,37532117,Rani,A beautifully styled spacious and super clean apartment. Great location - short walk to fantastic cafes/bars/restaurants/groceries/shopping - but very quiet. We loved our stay and wish we had longer to explore the area!

There are many elegant decorations. I enjoyed the stay in this place and would like to stay again if visiting south SF. The only minor problem is that it took some efforts to find parking spots on the street.
28733771,346470134,2018-11-08,24327076,Isabella,Jessica’s place is beautiful and in a great location. I loved staying here and felt really comfortable with my room and the space. I would definitely stay again and recommend to other guests!

This Airbnb had a great location to many eateries and was a short drive to downtown. I would recommend this space to future guests.
19265072,171122795,2017-07-16,81665933,Janine,Won's apartment is a MUST when booking in SF. Beautiful clean and spacious for 2. Walking distance to local shops on 24th Street and easy uber drives from Noe Valley to the best of San Francisco. Won offers restaurant recommendations sun bathing in the backyard and an elegant comfortable stay in the heart of the city. Would and will book again.

284117,97252186,2016-08-26,1637924,Maggie,AMAZING LOCATION AND PRICE!!  This place is truly a gem especially in a city as expensive as SF.  Noe Valley is a very cute and safe neighborhood that has shops & restaurants within walking distance and is well connected by public transportation.  The cottage shares a patio with the main house and is very comfortable cute and well equipped.  Samantha went out of her way to be kind and accommodating and was available by text throughout our stay.  I can't recommend highly enough.
5154227,299800552,2018-07-31,6648943,Lisa,The photos don’t really give you a sense of how great a space Dayne’s place is. We are two families with 4 teenagers and they all had space to stretch out and chill after a busy day. The rooms are lovely and airy. The location is well served by local transport and there are supermarkets restaurants and take away places within a few minutes walk. It is a great base for visiting San Francisco and Dayne could not have been more helpful. We thoroughly recommend this place. 
10661953,224919405,2018-01-04,29323349,Keyu,This place definitely spices up our trip in San Fransisco. Great place to stay!!

Would definitely stay again when we go back to SF.
3030653,34619320,2015-06-10,26213561,Robert,The entrance is through a garage but I don't need fancy when on vacation so I didn't mind. It is in an incredible area with good eats and drinks. When I stepped off the Bart into mission on 16th street I could immediately smell the fresh fruit and vegetables in the wind. As for the studio it was clean and had everything I needed. 
13022499,122732915,2016-12-25,3383964,Elodie,My friend and myself arrived quite late and separately and Peihong was always in touch with me for information. She really make us feel like at home. breakfast was also offered ( coffee bread cereals eggs) for free. The house is really big and nice the area is really safe and have a bus stop less than 10mins. walk. This bus can take you in SF city centre in about 20/30mins. Overall experience really great will definitely come back at her place. She even dropped us at the airport on our last day she was so sweet :)
8155586,564452647,2019-11-15,258902,Marceau,We were a group of 10 and had lots of space. Everything we needed was there and even a bottle of wine waited for us on the counter.

1332343,12748451,2014-05-10,1023136,Issachar (Ishay),"My wife Nava & me stayed for 4 days with Saundra. The ""NEST"" is perfect for a couple. It's clean warm and provide all necessary ammonites to make your stay comfort. The location is in a quite neighborhood. Within walking distance are Haight Ashbury lower Haight and Castro. All very nice places to visit and to enjoy nice shops and good restaurant. SF public transportation makes the access to all other interesting locations very easy. Saundra is a very nice person who gives you the right tips help if necessary and privacy at the same time. We warmly recommend her place. Ishay "
19412179,476678530,2019-06-26,2010806,Erin,Great one bedroom for exploring the city. Easy access. It's not right in the center of everything but I always love staying in this neighborhood because it's quiet and feels safe. And it's certainly not far from the action by any means. The bed was comfortable...nice little outside area if you want...shared bathroom was convenient. If you're someone staying in the city who plans to spend most of your time away from the room--it's perfect.
4269254,136130244,2017-03-08,47074120,Jake,I was in town for business for a few days - Marjorie's place was a great stay.  It was very cleanly and nice.  And Marjorie was very communicative and offered a lot of recommendations in the area!

The outdoor garden was a delight to sit in and drink your coffee in the morning. Thanks for being such a great host! Steven was timely kind and gracious. 

Thank you!"
5406893,81829515,2016-06-25,77716609,Daniel,"Our family enjoyed our stay at this apartment tremendously!   Jessica was amazing at answering all of our questions promptly and giving us a very warm reception when we arrived on the site.   The apartment looked amazing (like pictured) and was great for us (a couple) my mom and two kids (5 and almost 2).  

We were able to spread out nicely in the three bedrooms and still enjoy some adult time in the living and dining room after the kids were to bed without worry.  

Though our trip was short we made a few excursions down a few blocks for a few small shops and grocery pickups.  The neighborhood is very nice mostly residential and there wasn't much nighttime traffic.  

We enjoyed the many places you could curl up with a coffee or tea and catch up with family.   Thank you Jessica!  "
14790424,362571267,2018-12-26,22798920,Colleen,Great location very clean comfortable beds quite nice outdoor space and kitchen well stocked.

20361588,241120110,2018-03-07,37190399,Susan,This is a great place to stay! I loved watching the sunsets from my kitchen and bedroom window. The apartment is quiet and in a really good neighborhood. Having a full kitchen with spices and all the utensils made for a very economical visit. I hope to stay here again on my next trip to San Francisco.
5577516,233236642,2018-02-08,162801897,Francine,My Air BnB was perfect in every way.  Clean well-located and with a very pleasant host. This was a great location for my meeting at the California Academy of Sciences. I had a great time with fantastic restaurants located right next to the Academy in the Inner Sunset District and just a short walk from my accommodations.
6749412,428327590,2019-03-24,763618,Jonathan,It was a really great stay. The location was really nice.

209514,436733465,2019-04-13,12301018,Jeena,The room was surprisingly very spacious than it looks in the picture. The location is amazing -- close to both the park and the city center and so many transportation options. Josh is responsive and really organized and our room was even ready before the check in time!
845501,319527229,2018-09-06,84416180,Theodor,The place is good and the host is super.
4257302,160787612,2017-06-15,377597,Idette,Alexandra was very attentive  but discrete. The room is very quiet and the queen bed is extremely comfortable. There is an armoire for hanging clothes and a nice sized table for eating breakfast. She provided good coffee fruit yogurt and oatmeal. There is a small fridge and microwave if you wish to buy anything else  at the  big grocery store across the street. 
7182761,207231471,2017-10-28,18047343,Benoit,"Mon séjour s'est très bien passé. La chambre et la salle de bain sont très bien décorées.

J'y retournerai."
29416324,452262243,2019-05-12,95171271,Sara,A very comfortable clean space in a great location. The check in process was easy to follow. We were able to find great street parking right outside.

1336798,7790947,2013-10-03,7143295,Martin,"My family and I had an excellent stay in the Haight in Judith's house. The location is excellent within a minutes walk from ""that"" famous intersection with buses easily accessible from Haight street itself ( the 71 ). Haight Street market is just around the corner as well as plenty of vintage and quirky clothes stores and constant living reminders of a generation that changed the world ( when they weren't stoned ). We comfortably accommodated our four kids. Kitchen was great and every room seemed to have a TV. San Francisco is a great city to take the family and I highly recommend the house for its location and amenities. Only only negative was the lack of off-street parking. Don't worry - you don't need permits. Try not to move your rental car on Friday or Saturday nights as finding a park and winning the lottery can have the same probability. You shouldn't have too much trouble finding something on Oak street if you don't mind a short walk back to the house. Otherwise a solid four stars from me. Thanks Judith !"
13175533,208299097,2017-10-31,30604475,Lisa Marie,L'appartement chez Simone était parfait! Très bien situé très propre et moderne avec des touches personnalisé et très apprécié comme des collations un séchoir à cheveux des produits de toilette et des peignoirs. L'appartement est a proximité de bons cafés et restaurant et seulement à 10 minutes de marche de la plage. Je le recommande fortement.
16435615,547673587,2019-10-15,46889987,Adam,"I was in town for a meeting at Moscone Convention center which was a pleasant brisk 15 minute walk away. Also nearby is a rail car stop to go to the Ferry Building Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf.

The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Tiff was an excellent host with quick communication. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"
1241029,30468814,2015-04-22,24375314,TIlde,Had a lovely time at Jennifers home.  Everything is as advertised.  The location is great to walk/run along the Bay or to walk to the shops and restaurants off of Chestnut.  Jennifer was  a fabulous host ensuring I felt at home and had everything I needed.  I left SFO making a new friend!  I do not hesitate in recommending Jennifer's home. 
1393654,63658087,2016-02-25,32995442,Gary,Kevin is very proud of his long relationship with AirBee and takes every aspect seriously. What I liked was his concern for clarity.  He went to a lot of pains to anticipate any need or concern.  The place is mid century modern. Simple clean lines with a breathtaking view of a canyon from the back porch.  It was clean and orderly.  My room quite adequate with lots of great books.  It's not in a neighborhood as much as an area situated high on the West side of maybe the highest residential area in the city oddly – both very forested and jam packed with (Website hidden by Airbnb) the same time.  Good walking if you're a Billy goat...but you discover spots with amazing views.
7933558,94038784,2016-08-14,21981262,Ashley,Solomon was great at communicating prior to our arrival and sent in great detail all the check in/check out information. The house was very spacious and all the beds were super comfortable. The pictures shown are very accurate and the location was absolutely perfect! I would definitely book again in the future.  
8152867,75528013,2016-05-22,66355074,Mel,Carol was inviting and treated me like I was a member of her family. The bathroom is in the main portion of the house (through the garage) but it's not an issue. The TV in the bedroom has full access to a lot of Comcast channels which is a plus. It's a clean space in a quiet and safe neighborhood that's close to a lot of great restaurants.
1261074,188555872,2017-08-29,139937186,Jessica,This was my first AirBnB experience. I can safely say it was a nice experience. The hosts Jay and Meghan was really nice. Suggested a really good restaurant for us to order in. Sandra the cat was a true character. She does like to talk to you! I really enjoyed their home.
7348398,324736143,2018-09-17,94502068,Will,Immersed in one of the most famous neighborhoods of San Francisco is the house silent clean and comfortable with an incomparable style and amazing skyline view; Michael and his family always friendly to help you to recommend the best places they even offered us to share they car to go to 49ers game without a doubt I would stay again the best #superhosts that you can find in the foggy city. Gracias por todo Michael and enjoy the Tequila!
1569288,52593736,2015-10-31,3711914,Sally,Location location location.  This is a most wonderful apartment located next to Golden Gate Park.  Good public transport and quick Uber pickups made the entire Bay Area readily accessible & affordable.  We were out at Ocean Beach on the Judah one day and then into town on the 7 bus.  I don't think we ever waited more that 5 minutes for an Uber car to take us to Oakland or Mill Valley.  For walking you can choose hills or the flats.  Whole Foods has a great store a block away and the food trucks come across the street on Thursday.   Lots of great neighbourhoods to explore if you are keen to walk.  Good restaurants.  Safe location.   Our host was so accommodating and was a delight.  The apartment was charming clean and so comfortable.  Accurate photos.  I would like to have as good a bed at home as I slept in whilst there.  With 1.5 bathrooms we shared (two couples) the shower that is ensuite with the main bedroom. It was not a problem sharing - the main bathroom was tiled and very roomy with a great shower and shower head. (Also a jet bath but none of us tried it).   I give it 5 stars out of 5!  Would be pleased to stay there any time.  Thank you!! 
14179987,431813283,2019-04-01,43982959,Anne,I highly recommend this place. The space was small but efficient and literally squeaked with cleanliness. The bathroom looked brand-new. It felt secure. I very much appreciated the carport for parking off-street. I wasn’t bothered by street noise at all and the neighbourhood is walkable with some excellent restaurants very close by.
244361,443315877,2019-04-25,131337048,Jolanta,Great location very comfortable stay. Hope to visit again soon!
6628985,166219305,2017-07-03,79666038,Sourabh,Good location. Close to tourist sites. 
5013816,433493634,2019-04-06,240056393,Steven,This place was as advertised and that's a good thing. Very stylish and eclectic. Wonderful location in San Fran.
7902889,50349612,2015-10-11,531183,Yan,Michael was a very nice host. We felt very welcome. He gave us great suggestions for what to do in San Francisco.  Even though did a share reservation and stayed in his living room we always felt very comfortable. He was always very friendly and pleasant to chat with during the day and was very quiet at night. His place was clean.
12522,477971,2011-08-27,400051,Bridget,First AirBnb experience and it was soo easy. Brenda is a super host with plenty of great tips whatever the problem. Boo and Moo (sp?) are adorable Brenda really let's you feel relaxed. No awkwardness at all.  And it really is perfectly located. :) 
77175,952493,2012-02-27,1644881,Yasi,"Tyler & Shoreh's place was just what I was looking for: quiet private easy parking close to the city (driving and via BART) and nice accommodations. The room was comfortable nicely decorated spacious clean and welcoming (they left snacks and teas!).  The weather was beautiful during the stay so we took advantage of the outdoor patio for dinner one night--which was lovely. The house is about a 10-15 minute walk from some very good restaurants and BART. I would absolutely recommend Tyler & Shoreh's place to anyone looking for a ""home away from home"" in SF. "
3519611,38322255,2015-07-14,37065000,Wim,"We really enjoyed our four nights in Manuel's appartment. The location is indeed perfect with great restaurants cafés and supermarkt round the corner. We can recommend the happy your arrangement at Mama Cita Mexican restaurant. Bicycle rental is a few blocks away and bus 30 to Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square is nearby.

The three bedroom one bathroom appartment with separate living dining and kitchen was exactly what we needed for our citytrip."
20155822,358804057,2018-12-15,208668313,Paula,"This is a great location for easy access to many parts of the city. If walking be prepared for lots of steep hills.  However if urban hikes are not for you there is a bus line steps away and the cable cars routes are only a few short blocks away. 

The apartment was exactly as described and ideal for my temporary living needs. It has a very private quiet and cozy feel.  As it is located behind the garage noise from the street is rare. It does sit below the main house so you hear some activity from above albeit very reasonable. 

John & Andrea we’re wonderful hosts and extremely responsive during my stay."
22812395,282958181,2018-06-28,197604688,Chris,"You can't beat Marie's 2 bedroom apt if staying in San Francisco!
Compared to the cost of a hotel room nearby you get so much more for your money. During our stay the apt. was completely quite we could not tell someone was living upstairs. The private entrance allowed us to slip in and out without disturbing the homeowners and provided the same to us when they would leave. The breakfast items and snacks were a great touch too. 

Marie has really under advertised her place meaning that there is so much more offered than what is actually shown on her listing and was a nice surprise for us. 

Marie's communication was great she responded within an hour or less to any questions.

If staying in San Francisco again Marie's place would be our 1st choice!"
4100473,229821401,2018-01-25,177843,Bert,This was a great place to stay. Terrific neighbourhood combined with friendly and communicative hosts. Hope to stay here again sometime.
2236226,273314062,2018-06-05,1900380,Elke,Apartment is exactly as displayed in the images – amazing roof top and view. The apartment is small but very efficient with lots of smart detail - ideal to work and travel. Tasteful design. All you need to feel good. David is very responsive and collaborative. Thumbs up!!
3030653,21195169,2014-10-13,2581860,Aaron,A terrific place to stay! The studio was very comfortable and it's in a great location in SF close to shops and restaurants and bars but not on a busy loud block. Lindsay was the perfect host – friendly and organized with great communication. Really a perfect stay in San Francisco!
14426130,316712548,2018-08-31,44523975,Louise,"A really cool place in a great area in San Francisco. The house is two blocks from an incredible sandy beach surrounded by cafes vegan restaurants and surf shops. There is a MUNI stop literally one minute's walk away which will get you into the main touristy area of SF. This runs all day and even has a good service back at night. 
Dave and Desmo (the lovely dog) are super friendly hosts and we felt like we were at home while we stayed here. The door has a keycode lock so we were able to come and go as we needed and we were able to use the communal space including a nice coffee maker :)
Thank you Dave and Desmo!"
1277771,282594032,2018-06-27,151994567,Stephanie,Awesome location and great hosts. Would definitely stay here again
2058119,10624244,2014-02-28,104218,Tim,Javi is a good guy. Our stay was brief but good.
1433917,14162108,2014-06-13,15582873,Mads,We had a wonderful stay Mick and Barbara's place. The location is superb giving easy access to street cars heading down town and lies within walking distance of the Spanish mission Delores park and of course the bars and restaurants of Castro (don't miss the Anchor Oyster bar). We enjoyed using the luxurious beds and bathroom. An air bed for a fourth guest was also very comfortable. Added to that our hosts offered lots of information about transport and things to do in the town which really helped us exploit all that the town had to offer. Don't miss this!
21935870,353388208,2018-11-27,107815834,Terry,Olivia’s and Dan’s listing is fantastic! Very easy self-serve checkin process incredibly clean listing very spacious and especially comfortable. The listing is either brand new or was recently completely redone. Highly recommended!
21880287,263003678,2018-05-10,151830409,Amanda,Staying at Michael’s place was perfect for our first trip to California! It was extremely clean he was incredibly hospitable and provided breakfast for us every morning. Would definitely stay again!
21594483,273054545,2018-06-04,32261837,Nic,The apartment was great. Compact but we managed to sleep 4 adults ok. There are two bed options in the common space a large double and a fold out sofa. The kitchen provision of coffee sugar cereals etc was a nice touch. There are loads of towels and shampoo etc in the bathroom. Everything was very clean and although it has a joint entrance with the host you feel totally separate so it actually feels like a separate apartment. Easy to find good access to GG Park and the beach. Also a short walk to the N streetcar into downtown. Overall we had a great stay and Vasily was very helpful and communicative - thanks!
516836,550461235,2019-10-18,9663694,Max,"Beautiful spot nearly on the peak of potrero hill. Fran is really friendly and a perfect host. I can recommend this place!

Clean bath and noise depends a bit on the guests which stay in the other room close by."
6374167,192103799,2017-09-09,71380370,Flora,It`s a beautiful place on a great location. Thanks!
3124541,23092366,2014-11-23,11238983,Pierre,"Wir haben dieses Zimmer 12 Tage gebucht. Das linke angebaute Nachbarhaus wurde abgerissenwas bei der Buchung verschwiegen wurde. Wir hatten also tagüber die ganze Zeit Baulärm ausser am Wochende. Der Privateingang geht durch die Garage wo auch eine Warmwasseranlage steht und im Zimmer 24 Std hörbar ist (das Zimmer ist  angrezend auf der Ebene der Garage!). Im Zimmer selber hört man Musik u. jenachdem Werbespots wenn der Gastgeber das Radio oder die Stereoanlage anmacht weil das Zimmer mit  nicht abstellbaren Lautsprechern bestückt istdie direkt mit der Musikanlage verbunden sind. 
Die Raumfläche beträgt keine 18m2 hat nur 1 Nachttisch und nur 1 einen Stuhl und keine weitere Ablagefläche um die getragenen Kleider oder Utensilien abzulegen. Für 2 Personen ist dieses Mietobjekt ungeeignet und vor allem überteuert (€ 130 inkl. Gebühren pro Tag). Wir haben schon 2 andere Wohnungen/Zimmer in SF gemietet und haben deshalb Vergleichswerte!
Zum Gastgeber der in seinem Inserat vom Gast etliches abverlangt selber aber keinen Respekt zeigt: An einem Sonntagmorgen ist er mit Freunden um 02.00 heimgekommen hat uns damit geweckt und anschliessend bis 04.00 haben sie weiter gefeiert. An einem Werktag hat er uns um Mitternacht bei seiner Heimkehr mit seinem Freund wiederum geweckt weil das Getrampel und die Gespräche durch diesen Vorhang nicht gedämpft werden. Es gehört eine Tür zu diesem Treppenabang besonders wenn man Untermieter hat. Wir hatten Gefühl nicht wirklich willkommen zu sein weil er oft nachfragte: what are you going to do today what are your plans?? Wir waren nämlich nicht für Sightseeing nach SF gekommen sondern um unsere Tochter Ihren Mann und unser 6 Monate alter Enkel zubesuchen die in der Nachbarschaft in  einer 1-Zimmerwohnung leben. Das hat in enorm gestört dass wir nicht morgens früh weggingen und spät abends  heimkamen. 
Wir haben schon über 10 B&B gebucht nicht nur bei Airbnb und haben noch nie eine negative Beurteilung abgeben müssen. Diese Unterkunft können wir definitiv nicht empfehlen.
Pierre & Rita

1203172,418649062,2019-03-02,90024503,Pranav,"Rachael and John have a beautiful home in Bernal Heights. The room itself is cozy and comfortable with ample space for 3 people. There's a convenient chest of drawers to keep your clothes and lots of space around the room for any suitcases and large bags. The washroom is pristine. In fact the description of the listing is completely accurate. Rachael and John themselves were the most wonderful hosts. We really enjoyed breakfast in the family's kitchen where there's homemade granola fresh fruit freshly ground coffee and terrific muffins.

Overall we highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a comfortable stay with very warm hosts!"
2046634,62811099,2016-02-17,45993403,Nikayla,My boyfriend and I rented the green room and this house was exactly if not even nicer than the pictures show! I was very pleasantly surprised. Very spacious for a San Francisco home. Also Kenix was very sweet and made us feel at home. I would definitely book anytime I'm in the bay!
15759935,249132343,2018-04-01,7089445,Casan,Great location! Cute place! Very generous hosts.
3718865,282970561,2018-06-28,68272398,Luci,My favorite Airbnb so far! I loved Katie’s apartment it was welcoming and comfortable. She makes everything very clear and easy for her guests. Definitely will go back
2770268,14188652,2014-06-14,8663726,Christopher,"Stayed with Raman for 3 night while attending the conference.  The location of the apartment is great right in the quiet Portrero hill neighborhood.  The apartment is only 2 blocks away from the CalTrain and a short ride via Uber to downtown SF.

The apartment is very clean and cozy.  It was a nice stay and Raman was very accommodating.  Unfortunately we didn't get to chat too much as I was away most of the time with work but I would definitely recommend this place."
22586319,252701712,2018-04-11,25376330,Will,Jean was very accommodating during my stay. She was communicative and prompt during the reservation process. The studio is located in a quiet neighborhood in visitation valley close to shops and public transit. I would love to stay in her clean quaint studio again.
3081560,72033833,2016-04-30,9042358,James,A fantastic space in a brilliant neighbourhood with perfect hosts. The children were not noisy at all and the little touches in the room are everything that Airbnb is about. Thoroughly recommended for any business or pleasure trip
20149972,357260981,2018-12-09,30815306,Jackie,Katherine’s place was great! Easy to find and in a safe area. Location was close enough to everything we needed for our weekend in San Fran. The place was clean and the balcony had the best views. Would certainly book again next time we are in the city! Thanks Katherine.
9225,113737156,2016-11-13,103045299,Martin,I couldn't be more thankful for the wonderful experience my husband and I had here this weekend. Perfect walking location to grab groceries at Whole Foods explore neighborhoods and enjoy beautiful scenery. Cute and cozy home to enjoy. Very clean place  also extremely quiet. 
6494663,402502680,2019-01-18,146881084,Shannon,Beautiful place...felt like my own private hotel room but very upscale and very clean.  Love the shower in Room A and the whole place overall. Well done!
33578,454737,2011-08-17,313729,Jason,"wow seriously coming through that gate into the magic garden is pretty breath taking i recommend arriving after dark just for that experience.

kepa is cool interesting and accommodating a big thumbs up."
494111,41920584,2015-08-10,3917298,Jason,"I have nothing but positive things to say about Vivian and the Studio! The description was absolutely accurate. Vivian worked with some intricacies in my schedule. The location and studio were both fantastic. 

Hope you don't mind the Heart Smiley Face that I placed on your key chain! The other identifier fell off right away. 

I would certainly stay again and recommend it to anyone. "
9108108,87589273,2016-07-20,28471631,Pilar,"The apartment was beautiful and well kept.  There are adorable prints of Molly and her family throughout the home.  My kids loved looking at them.  The area was perfect for us because I was working at SF General Hospital which was less than 2 blocks away.  It was also very convenient to the highway which was great because we often took road trips on weekends.

Parking on the street was easy and we had no problems but we did have a pass.  On street cleaning days we sometimes had to park a few blocks away if we came back after work but mostly found spots right on the same street.  We never used the parking garage but it is only a 1/2 block away and would have worked fine too for shorter stays.  There are also buses and UCSF shuttles nearby. 

It is a great apartment if you are traveling with small children.  The bunk beds were ideal and the books and toys were great to have there for them as was the baby gate.  The books and toys were all in great condition and the children's bedroom was neat and clean.  The backyard was beautiful and there were delicious fresh lemons as an added bonus!   There is a cute park that is one block away too with a playground for kids.  The kitchen was lovely with high quality appliances and it worked great for us.  

Molly responded to texts and emails promptly and we had no problems.  She also addressed special needs we had without any difficulties.  She was a gracious host and made us feel welcome. 

We stayed there for a month so we got to know the place and the area pretty well.  Dynamo donuts is just a few blocks away and has great donuts and great coffee too.  There are great restaurants that are 10-15 min walks from the apartment.  Some were a little far to walk to with small kids.  The neighbors upstairs were polite and friendly (and shared their lemons with us).   They had a large dog who was very friendly and good with small children.  

All in all it was a great experience and we would definitely consider staying here again and wholeheartedly recommend it to other travelers. "
5998790,357581899,2018-12-10,6948234,Michael,I was in SF for two days and this was a perfect place to stay. It is located in a nice quiet neighborhood but close to some great restaurants. I would stay there agian.
10193457,441336820,2019-04-21,250489097,Katie,Great place to stay! 10/10 would recommend
30770207,366467248,2019-01-02,29895355,Ji,A very cozy and comfortable space. There’s free street parking (just make sure to look at the signs for cleaning) One Waan was a great Thai restaurant nearby.
216042,59952985,2016-01-17,28099531,Chris,Enjoyed a wonderful stay at Jocelyn's place. Very comfortable and had everything I needed. Great location and neighbourhood and Jocelyn was very welcoming (even thought we did not meet) and provided really good snacks and provisions was easily contactable to answer any questions and was full of useful advice and tips. Would definitely recommend for a relaxing and comfortable stay.
53934,702553,2011-11-08,446521,Samantha,This was my second time staying with megan and manny and It was just as great of a trip. The location is perfect as is is close to all the downtown shopping/ restaurants/ bars and very close to the BART and busses. Both times I've stayed here I have felt very much at home and comfortable. The new redecorating in the guest bedroom is great!
545685,187884104,2017-08-27,142718975,Kathy,"This place is a hidden gem.  It sits back from the road so there are no street noises.  The bed is very comfortable and furnishings including the bathroom are updated well maintained and very clean.  We were surprised at the amount of space there was the additional living room with TV and eating table and private entrance make it much more than a ""private room""  accommodation. Checkin was very easy and Su the host was very responsive to questions.  Did not have a problem finding parking on that street.  Terrific value and very comfortable clean accommodation."
1125115,352847233,2018-11-25,227136118,Karl,"Ein riesiges Haus mit einem außerordentlichen Zimmer. Lulu hat mich freundlich empfangen und Stand immer für Fragen zur Verfügung. Es gab zwar viele Regeln aber die waren schnell erklärt und helfen alles schön und ordentlich zu halten. Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel waren sehr einfach zu erreichen und angenehmer als selbst mit dem Auto in die Stadt zu fahren. Tickets gab's in der ""Muni App""."
21632344,250624848,2018-04-05,59435092,Sven & Ellis,This stay has everything you need. Jean is always responding fast and she is friendly. The neighborhood is quiet . We had a pleasant stay thank you Jean.

1177310,349551767,2018-11-17,4607814,Patrick,Michael’s space was the perfect place to begin our weeklong apartment hunt in our new city. The space was warm and fully stocked with all the amenities we needed and more while the neighborhood offered cute cafes and nearby markets and restaurants. Michael and Brad were wonderfully hospitable; we couldn’t have asked for kinder hosts. When in need of an AirBNB in the city we’ll be sending guests their way.
13239943,482002222,2019-07-05,273667770,Harry,Close to North Beach Italian restaurants and Chinatown an absolute gem and value for money with a most hospitable host

259621,60284845,2016-01-21,1558669,Jeanne And Alejandro,I had a great time staying at the Pacific Tradewinds hostel! It's great to stay in a place where you have instant friends and feel immediately comfortable. They could add a few more creature comforts (like more hooks in the dorm and maybe a small table; a shelf or table in the bathroom area; a blender in the kitchen) but other than that I really enjoyed my stay. Great location near Chinatown Market Street Union Square North Beach.
27960744,505784679,2019-08-09,192727525,Mika,On our trip to SF me and my girlfriend had a splendid time at Rosalinda & Dennis’s place. Unfortunately we didn’t get to meet Dennis but Rosalinda was a super nice host. Their place is super clean and has thoughtful touches. Everything you need from on-suit water to towels and hair dryer basically everything you need for a weekend get-away to SF. Altough the location is about 30mins public transport ride from the city center connections are really good and we found loads of places to have food and drinks in close proximity to our stay. Also the folder provided by our hosts was full of very useful information. We can only recommend staying with Rosalinda and Dennis we had a blast
10524804,533483080,2019-09-21,194626457,Tina,Die Unterkunft ist nahe am Meer gelegen. Caitie und Josh waren nette Gastgeber.

32400382,468533153,2019-06-12,70411375,Ty,"Ting was a fantastic host couldn’t ask for better! She was very helpful with informative recommendations and suggestions relating to our San Fran trip. Communication was prompt and helpful she went above and beyond with a couple of personal needs we had. 
The accommodations were spacious comfortable clean and convenient. The bedrooms were comfortable and spacious with a fantastic outdoor balcony. The 2 bathrooms were spacious with awesome showers! Upscale fixtures and appliances throughout. Located in a beautiful quiet neighborhood. Street parking is 2 hr limit during the day would highly recommend purchasing a parking pass if you plan to park a vehicle during the day. If you return late parking can be a little thin had to park about a block away after driving around for about 20min both nights. We will certainly stay again on our next trip...you should too!"
8167459,494143790,2019-07-23,155899394,Joshua,Excellent location and attention to detail.
22586319,448086240,2019-05-04,23668667,Tina,The space is perfect for a good nights rest (bedding was amazingly soft) and a nice shower. It’s about 15-20 minute drive from downtown which is nice for the price. Walls are very thin so make sure to bring ear plugs or head phones if you’re a light sleeper.
14804950,154069893,2017-05-22,19443786,Andrea,Angela was hands down the best Airbnb host that we have ever had! The place was exactly as pictured charming very clean and tastefully decorated.  Having spent our entire lives in the Midwest/east coast we were slightly nervous about visiting the west coast but her communication was excellent her tone was welcoming and she provided us with great recommendations. I would and hopefully will definitely stay there again!
840986,30064242,2015-04-17,25183798,Olivier,We spent one week in Addy & Carlota's apartment in April 2015. The apartment is very spacious and is provided with everything you could possibly need and a lot more !  Highly recommended !

8739,6502,2009-08-01,26974,Elisabetta & Julian,Ivan and Wendy have been superb hosts: we could not have asked for more. We enjoyed our stay with them very much and we highly recommend them to anybody who is looking for a wonderful place with great people. Their house is really nice and spotless clean. Very convenient location spacious and beautiful.
22554459,496677225,2019-07-27,26705698,Benjamin,This is a well-kept-up apartment that is essentially the basement of the owners’ home.  But because the house is set on a hill that slopes to the back it opens onto a magnificent view of the city from the kitchen and there is a lovely courtyard in back.  The space is comfortable for two or three travelers (if two share a bed) and the location is wonderful.  Less than a ten-minute walk to Golden Gate Park near several painted steps trails.  Stephanie was out of the country while we visited but her husband Steve was as friendly and helpful as could be.  Great value for the price.
392543,210695416,2017-11-10,10323375,Mary Beth,Amazing spot in a perfect walkable vibrant neighborhood! Lovely peaceful home with serene garden and terrific host! Super close to lots of great restaurants!!!

l'appartement est bien equipé avec des jeux de société video et musique et surtout une bibliothèque très intéressante
Quelle bonne surprise aussi de trouver fruits frais gourmandises fleurs vin.... Dans le jardin j'ai pu passer quelques moments 
de détente .
Le quartier est calme et sécurisant avec de jolies maisons et jardins typiques de SF et à quelques pas des rues animées de bons restaurants et commerces pratiques et variés. Nous sommes aussi a proximité du GGP lac muséesjardin (Website hidden by Airbnb) nombreux transports en commun nous emmènent facilement à l'océan et d'autres quartier de San francisco 
de temps en temps on peut voir et entendre les perroquets qui survolent  le quartier. 
Bien des choses a dire encore sur mes séjours dans ce quartier et cette maison si sympathique.....

229240,8572711,2013-11-05,1021074,Irineu,"I stayed at the hostel for 2 nights and I am very happy to have chosen it!
The location is very central the street is calm walking distance to the most of the tourist locations and good connections of public transport.
The hostel itself is wery nice cozy people are helpful and friendly. I had a very good sleep there and other dorm hosts were polite and calm.
Thank you for a very good stay!"
11259062,427005441,2019-03-22,5091125,Eloise,Really enjoyed a whimsical stay in this well designed small urban envelope. Welcomed by a batch of earthy happy chooks as well as a fruited up lemon tree to die for plus a flowering blossom tree...gorgeous; really made my tea moments gazing out at this through the big windows. Plethora of diverse local eateries and retail shops added to my adventure. Easy 5 minute access on foot downhill to 24th Street Mission Bart and only a couple of stops to the downtown area. Hosts were kind and generous.
24379811,468517661,2019-06-12,254283260,Michael,Karen is an excellent host. Very clean and up to date accommodations Great location.  Enjoyed stay.
33578,2190211,2012-09-04,2344634,Thierry,"We stayed 3 times during our visit to California in two differents studios. The garden suite is a bit bigger. You have more view at the first foor.
We will probably call her during our next stop in San Francisco."

13788749,112582861,2016-11-06,67690746,Marloes,Een fijne plek in een fijn huis met een aardige en betrouwbare host. Ik heb er goed geslapen relatief rustig en toch centraal. 
1123125,257579703,2018-04-26,181384472,Shelby,Staying with Marion was great. I had never been in a Victorian style home before so I was looking forward to my stay. She was warm and welcoming gave me a tour of the home when I arrived and I got to meet her doggy Ginger. The little touches were very nice; bottle of wine on the coffee table in my room fresh fruit & a water pitcher ready to go. She had coffee ready when I woke up in the morning as well. Looking forward to staying again in the future when I come to the city for work!

位置方面:離漁人碼頭45分鐘車程｡到國際機場15分鐘車程｡
巴士站走路回家需要經過一條很陡的人行天橋房子靠近高速公路有一點車流噪音｡Uber打車就很方便了｡
Justin房東雖然沒有見面但是溝通起來很順暢給到很多幫助!
最後一家人入住又能洗衣做飯的在舊金山這家性價比就很高了!推薦!

I'd definitely recommend this place for other travelers whether it's to explore SF or on a business trip. I really had my own privacy and was in the middle of the action."

992913,48982479,2015-09-30,29013421,Amanda,The house is in a great location easy walks to most main attractions. Don't expect anything too flashy but kept clean. Greg the host was awesome! 
27197424,472928712,2019-06-20,7180734,Clarice,My best friend and I stayed here for 5 days to celebrate our birthdays in San Francisco. We tend to use the kitchen daily for coffee snacks and some meals and were so happy with how complete the kitchen is equipped. The layout of the rooms is quite nice and provides a great deal of privacy. Big bathrooms with plenty of shampoo soap etc. Living area is roomy and the views from each room are spectacular. We were a little nervous about the location before we arrived- we were so pleasantly surprised to find the location great and we felt safe - close to everything either walking public transit or short uber/lyft rides. We never felt uncomfortable. This is a  great place we felt at home and enjoyed every little touch the hosts have thought of. Good and abundant towels kitchen amenities - plenty of everything you need to be able to cook meals good iron  big television hints and guidebooks check in directions attentive hosts. . . we would stay here again.
2046634,103322409,2016-09-21,26495171,Peter,"Kenix was a great host! She met me promptly when I arrived and was very responsive to my questions prior to my stay. The place is beautifully decorated and on a quiet tree lined street. Ten minute walk to train station and plenty restaurants within walking distance. Bus line 49/14 directly to town. 
"
10469182,489451894,2019-07-16,4677152,Ellie,Comfortable and sweet with a lot of thoughtful touches from the host. Spotless airy space  with an outdoor patio - rare and special. Landy makes you feel welcomed and leaves a lot of creature comforts and treats for you to enjoy. Excellent stay for a Presidio business trip.
28376750,411517034,2019-02-12,71044361,Chad,Nando's house is clean well-located and easy to access and use. The bed was also very comfortable.
8474452,197771346,2017-09-26,145990078,Päivi,Sijainti julkisilla liikkumisen suhteen oikein hyvä. Kuvat vastasivat todellisuutta. Rauhallinen pikkukatu. Kuitenkin liikenteen huminaa mutta herkkäuninenkin pärjäsi hyvin korvatulpilla.
32712890,433564385,2019-04-06,18770630,Rin,Such a great host modern cozy place! Better than downtown area.   Especially the place make your feel warm and safe plus clean ! Description equal to expectation!!! Host is sweet well prepare guide book for us where can explore in San Francisco. Absolutely will book it next time and recommend whoever going SF.
334339,277609695,2018-06-16,169452336,Chris,Bruce and Mo’s place is an absolute delight to stay at. Not only are they both warm and welcoming but they go above and beyond to make you feel at home (Roxy the dog too!). Full of local knowledge and tips they give excellent advice for exploring the city. Their place is beautiful to stay at and in a perfect location to either walk around the Castro area or easily get public transport to the rest of San Francisco. Couldn’t recommend staying here more and cannot wait for my next trip back!
2126868,237128139,2018-02-21,75505240,Sharmeen,"The room I got (the Jungle Room) was beautiful. Full of real plants and with a big beautiful window that overlooked the street. The place is spotless and although it can get a little cold at night there are enough blankets and comforters to keep you warm. 

The added advantage of being able to have breakfast in the morning makes it great for anyone wanting an early start to their day."
32610962,433543482,2019-04-06,10898379,Betsabe,Jerry's place was so pretty. Everything is new so it feels like a fancy hotel. It was about a 7min walk to Muni. And even less time to great restaurants. Can say enough good things about the shower! They welcomed me with wine a fruits and a tiny Canadian flag. A very sweet touch. :-) Great place for a business traveler to stay in.
17811571,326225598,2018-09-21,49324455,Phil,Great space bigger than I thought. Bed was super comfy shower was good kitchen was fully stocked. Check in easy and stay was awesome. Highly recommended.
13857866,127872583,2017-01-21,1653723,Amy,What a lovely apartment! Gorgeous all around and a lovely night away! Would stay here anytime we come to the Bay area.
57561,8625065,2013-11-09,8250263,Greg,Really nice little apartment. Clean and well kept and well equipped with everything I need. The location was great for getting out and exploring and some good nightlife nearby Check in and everything was very easy and straightforward. It all made my trip simple and very enjoyable.
21123508,334691440,2018-10-09,12429014,Girard,Great location and interesting antique elevator.
96383,2940470,2012-11-22,3764604,Annika,Jay is a very nice and easy going host - friendly and respectful of needs for privacy and still happy to answer any questions. The room I rented was clean and very nice - comfortable bed there was no problem with the shared bathroom and access to the kitchen was useful. The location: walking distance to everything - otherwise buses adn public transportion around the corner. Considering price and commodity; highly recommended!  
4013746,31045716,2015-05-01,28284515,Lukasz,"Sue and Chuck provided me and my friends with amazing hospitality. Place was just as described stocked with everything we would need. Location was absolutely great moderately close to golden gate park and other interesting places in the city. Neighbourhood is safe and quiet which allowed us to take perfect rest during our visit.

Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
2316478,56205913,2015-12-10,31246942,Matt,The house was wonderful and just as we expected. The neighborhood was perfect for a family with walking distance to restaurants grocery stores and the beach. We will definitely look at staying here again. 
2825966,56811183,2015-12-18,37428442,Ken,"The location is very good!

The host is very nice!"
3767907,40551731,2015-08-01,22495378,Juliana,"We was lucky to find this gourgeos apartment: very well located and furnished very confortable  ( beds and shower - the most necessary was perfect as all the rest of things!) great neighboors no noise anytime easy public transportation: Muni and bart station so close. We had a long stay there because we were studing on Berckeley (45 minutes by muni and bart) and as so as the distance it was our goal! We had more time to enjoy everything that san frco offers to the tourists living as a local citizens! And so all that we need so close: supermarket restaurants farmacy movie theater and a lovely coffee shop just around the corner! Great wi fi at home laundry and dryer machine...

And so Patrick and Wenlin. They are the best hostess! As a 5-star-hotel-concierges they thought about everything that you need for a great stay! Guides maps information everything on time! So we arrived as a guest and we are leaving with two great friends! We just have to say THANKS for everything!""

53934,19818528,2014-09-19,17245218,Justin,Megan and Manny were great and very welcoming hosts.  Manny even provided child care so we could have a couple nights out and our kids loved him!  They provided some great San Francisco and neighborhood information prior to and during visit (restaurants bars transit info parks etc).  Condo was pretty conveniently located for conference at Moscone center.  We felt at home inside the condo - it had comfortable beds good sized bedrooms full kitchen washer and dryer nice living room great roof top deck with patio furniture and expansive views of the city.  We were there in September and on the hottest day it got a little warm inside with no AC but for the most part opening windows was fine.  The TV didn't have full cable not really a problem other than one football game we wanted to watch was on ESPN.  The condo is a couple blocks from the edge of Tenderloin district which seemed to have a lot of homelessness we never felt unsafe or anything like that but maybe worth mentioning.  Overall excellent stay in a nice condo and we couldn't have asked for better hosts.
1725853,43019253,2015-08-17,28285814,Elisabeth,"Wir wurden von Lina und Alex sehr herzlich begrüßt und fühlten uns gleich wie zu Hause. Das Appartement war wie eine kleine Wohnung (Schlafzimmer Wohnzimmer große neuwertige Einbauküche und modernes Bad) und optisch sowie technisch auf modernstem Niveau. Alles war sehr sauber und mit Liebe eingerichtet. Die Ausstattung ließ keine Wünsche offen und der Preis der Wohnung war mehr als angemessen. Das Appartement liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend (mit Vorort-Charakter) in der Nähe des Pazifiks und ungefähr 30 Minuten mit der Bahn vom Zentrum entfernt.

Unsere Gastgeber waren sehr hilfsbereit und taten wirklich alles damit wir uns wohlfühlten. 100%iges Weiterempehlung-Potential... ;)

Thanks to Lina and Alex...we appriciated it. "
1633933,495859358,2019-07-26,12740710,Aditya,Amazing place right next to one of the coolest parks in SF. Totally worth it
4464347,550450329,2019-10-18,160200775,Silja,Amazing hostel fun activities offered met great people!
24013191,279471478,2018-06-20,90108947,Debra,The three bedroom basement kitchenette apartment didn’t have any view but the beds were comfy and the room was dark. You could hear the person living upstairs walking around at night. The water was loud running through the pipes so if your a light sleeper wear earplugs. The location was a little further than I would have expected for the price. It was a 30 minute walk to Giradelli and 45 to pier 39. Overall a decent place. 
7327920,363401793,2018-12-28,204315695,Vicki,Lovely apt with magnificent view and succulent garden.
9476010,107964388,2016-10-13,3433626,Mikey,Wow! This is what I always imagined living in San Francisco would be like:  a pristine home with a balcony where I can enjoy a starlit view of the city and a kitchen/dining area fit to host a banquet. Lauren & Mitch were so easy to communicate with regarding logistics - very prompt and informative responses. The home looks exactly like the photos and is equipped with everything you need. I highly recommend their home and would be delighted to stay again! 
6423158,452716104,2019-05-13,186533431,Andrea,Beautiful home! We loved the area and it was only a 15 minute walk to little restaurants and stores. If you are planning to do a lot downtown or closer to Fisherman's Wharf be prepared to take a 20-25 min Uber.
11494067,320360503,2018-09-08,86669731,Ben,Catherine’s place is everything we expected and more - very stylish and clean. Checking in and out was very quick and easy. The bed was super comfortable the kitchen had everything we needed the tv had plenty of channels to choose from and the toiletries in the bathroom were amazing! The location is good for the Golden Gate Bridge Alcatraz etc if you don’t mind driving or taking public transport. If you are taking public transport it is a very short walk to the stops. We couldn’t fault Catherine’s place and would recommend to anyone who is visiting San Fran.
1434314,233249047,2018-02-08,63745313,Parker,This was the best stay I've ever had on Airbnb! I stayed here with some work colleagues and we were taken aback. Alex and Tammi's place was absolutely beautiful they were fully communicative and made us feel entirely welcome.
1510363,113044082,2016-11-09,1189111,Phil,Charlesie and Tedd are the most thoughtful considerate and generous hosts which we have ever experienced. They go out of their way to provide a welcoming atmosphere to communicate effectively and at the same time respect one's privacy. The way they stock the kitchen and refrigerator with food and drink is absolutely unique. They do all that they can so that a guest can park as close as possible although it is easy to find parking in the quiet residential neighborhood - despite the closeness to a college and a high school. The apartment had everything which we needed. It is roomy and cozy. There is easy access to buses BART and a streetcar line which takes one downtown in 30 minutes. With the auto one can be on I-280 within 5 minutes. To SF airport it is a 20 minute drive.  Grocery stores are close by. We think that this is the perfect place to stay in San Francisco.
18242785,182508699,2017-08-14,11551349,Meena,Alvin and Linda's place was clean and had a beautiful view of the Bay Area! We had 4 people in our group and had plenty of space. It was pretty close to shops and restaurants (0.5mi) but we weren't used to San Francisco hills and found the walk difficult though. Alvin was really easy to communicate with and got back to us quickly. Check-in/out was painless. Would stay here again!
12870849,204374731,2017-10-17,21272914,Mabel,Exactly as described. Zach's place is convenient - light rail station is only few minutes away. Self check-in instruction is clear and easy. We booked a room with private bathroom - both are clean and comfort with all the necessity. He even allowed us to use his kitchen when he wasn't around during our stay. He also allows us for a full refund for shortening one night before trip due to some misplannning. Thumbs up highly recommended.
77175,3894722,2013-03-25,3536423,Neil,"Tyler & Shoreh's place is a great find - it's secluded in a great neighbourhood that manages to have a really ""village"" feel while also being only 5 min walk from BART and a really short drive from the 280. Yes there are hills but if you're even moderately mobile you should have no problem walking around. 
The studio has pretty much everything I would ask for. Comfy bed really quiet laundry facilities solid wireless and a really beautiful view! 
I was pretty busy and wasn't at the property for long but found Tyler to be very friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be checking availability next time I need to stay in SF."
1203172,501495334,2019-08-03,249735885,Joni,Friendly helpful host affordable accommodations good location for the view but hilly.
28582487,567466415,2019-11-22,3504483,Ashley,Wendy’s place was immaculate and what a beautiful building and area! Perfect for a quiet serene getaway in the middle of the city
749990,6038522,2013-07-27,1618575,Patricia,"This apartment is ahhh mazing. Everything is designed perfectly and both beds are super comfortable (I slept in the sofa bed)  The appliances are top notch. I wish we had more time to spend there but it will be a top choice while in SF

Many thanks to Amy for her clear and efficient communication 

Loved loved this place "
12176844,208952432,2017-11-03,14366890,Juan Pablo,Perfect location and views. Fully equipped Scott is a perfect host this is definitely the best find in San Francisco!
30064463,439760335,2019-04-19,74456556,Ryan,Had a good stay at Felix's place during a business trip.
1261074,323097510,2018-09-14,53013400,Bomi,Kind host & quick response! Thank you.
1578597,17869379,2014-08-18,17271444,Amanda,We were 100% happy with our stay at The Skyline Suite. It was comfortable and clean and Jon-Pierre and his brother were extremely nice and helpful. We would love to stay there again. Bonus- there is transportation across the street and a Wholefoods in walking distance. It is also a fabulous neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Very beautiful.
8992582,54195353,2015-11-16,19805592,Hayley,Great place! Beautiful views from the apartment and nice space. Caleb was a great host very helpful and friendly. The apartment is in a quiet area but still close to downtown! 
8102262,154014699,2017-05-22,116084867,Constantin,Small but really nice and cozy room everything clean. Hosts are really helpful welcoming and talkative with great advice. Ten minutes walk to public transport takes approx. 35 min. directly to downtown without problems. Huge grocery store is really close by walking. We enjoyed our stay and recommend this accomodation to everyone who wants to spend some nice time in San Francisco !!
13127954,335995258,2018-10-13,187627428,Shiho,I had a very pleasant stay with Sarah & Pankaj. The house is neat and the owner is really nice and responsible.  Highly recommended!
21488120,363902450,2018-12-29,4414766,Lisa,The host is extremely difficult to get in touch with. It's a centralized messaging center located in Canada so you receive a different person each time you initiate a message.  If you have any real issues its extremely frustrating as you jump through multiple hoops and have to re-explain the issue to multiple people.
17444930,203853631,2017-10-15,63402147,Andru,Koncha is an excellent host and the place was incredibly well decorated and comfortable. Her dog is maybe one of the cutest dogs I’ve ever seen. My friends and I had a great time staying here and would definitely be back if we are in the area. Highly recommend this spot if you are okay with a little fur buddy being in the house.
4897143,226608395,2018-01-11,6697431,Hugh,Really cozy hostel. Friendly yet casual staff. Great price and inclusive events. Neighborhoods a little dodgy but seems safe enough. A bit of a walk to the main lines of public transit.
20154622,407640631,2019-02-02,55789213,David,They were very accommodating and friendly. A
519796,133158602,2017-02-20,31462831,James,We loved staying at Suzette's cozy place in Russian Hill. My girlfriend and I were in town for a wedding.  I used to live in SF and it was her first time.  Suzette's apartment was perfect for us as it is not only centrally located close to many tourist destinations but also many great local restaurants and shops.  We were able to get a very well rounded experience seeing the well known parts of the city while hanging like SF locals.  Suzette was a great host she gave us our space but was extremely responsive when we needed her always offering to help with suggestions and we were happy to have snacks and refreshments available when we arrived.  Check in instructions were clear and check in and check out were a breeze.  We will surely be back to SF in the future and we'd gladly stay at Suzette's place again.
8167459,218040219,2017-12-10,89625230,Sarah A,"Michelle’s communication was clear and concise so finding her place and checking in and out was easy. 
Our room was super clean and comfortable with added amenities as well as easy access to downtown.  We wished we’d had more time to take neighborhood walks in her lovely location!"
1614622,19471216,2014-09-13,10868516,Michael,We enjoyed our stay at Sal's beautiful home.  It is conveniently located very clean and comfortable.  Sal was very flexible and made it easy for us when he allowed us to drop off our luggage in the morning (check in was the afternoon) so we could go to the Giant's afternoon game without worrying about the luggage.  Would recommend staying at Sal's when visiting the City.
3895335,43423680,2015-08-19,36291363,Charlotte,My boyfriend and I stayed at Val's for 5 nights. Val was there when we arrived and showed us the house and our room. She was very friendly and helpful. She kept her dog away from us because one of us is allergic. The room was nice and was as shown on the picture. We shared the bathroom with her and her sister which wasn't a problem at all. Close to the house are bus stops towards downtown. Bernal Hights itself is very nice too. 
5299538,37587807,2015-07-08,26421326,Prokop,"Actually during my stay only Zain was there. But he was very friendly.. he gave tips where to go in the city and I could really behave as at home! Also the place was clean and comfortable and there was lot of space even there were more ""airbnbers"". So I can only recommend if you are planning to visit San Francisco!"
491874,96154520,2016-08-21,44875803,Amanda,Sona and her husband are wonderful hosts! They are very welcoming and friendly. Their home is clean and extremely comfortable. The bedroom with large private bathroom was fully equipped with everything we needed. It was so nice to be able to experience San Fran from a locals perspective. The neighborhood is in a great location no more than a 15-20 minute drive to all the fun activities we had planned for the weekend.  I would definitely recommend their home to anyone.
6688004,160369223,2017-06-13,132321839,Kevin,"If you want a fantastic caring yet hands-off host Linda is your best bet. First and foremost her house is amazing. Very artsy and crafty and located on the top of a hill with sweeping views of the San Francisco countryside and cityside. It's evident Linda has lived quite a life of travel and culture - everything in her home points to her travels around the globe and makes you feel like you're in a treehouse of sorts. She has great suggestions on food in the area (tons of great eats ~10 minute walk away!) and knows other San Francisco districts quite well. I would highly recommend anyone new to the area to stay with Linda - she has a wealth of knowledge she's willing to share to ensure you have an amazing stay! She also gives you space and is respectful of boundaries. 

Next is the way(s) Linda went above and beyond: on my first night in San Francisco I was robbed at a bar and was left without a phone identification and any money. She jumped into action and worked with me to ensure I could get in touch with my family get my passport and a new phone shipped to her house and worked with FedEx when they were less than helpful. She truly made me feel like I had an ally during a very difficult time. I credit Linda's help for being able to go home safely! 

It can be hard to find a near stranger so willing to help and dedicate time and energy to making your stay a worthwhile one but Linda was a near perfect host. I would highly recommend her and her awesome home to any traveler. "
3441517,76883546,2016-05-29,21377795,Alyxandra,"BEST AIRBNB HOST EVER!  My husband and I stayed in Judith's apartment for two nights on our honeymoon and we couldn't have asked for a better experience.  From Judith's amazing hospitality to the comfy bed sunny porch and beautiful location our two days in San Fran were perfect.  If we could have stayed longer we would have!  Thank you Judy for making us feel so welcome - we felt like family by the time we left!

596042,8510598,2013-11-03,7143897,Helen,Jay is an experienced host and very welcoming.  As a result my stay was hassle free. This is a great spot from which to walk into town but still quiet at night. Room was well set up and comfy. Would definitely recommend Jay's place to those visiting SF. 
786506,135350911,2017-03-04,18290809,Jun,A comfortable way to stay SF. I only felt shower is not excellent to use.  Not a major issue though
17305040,252916378,2018-04-12,2487743,Nancy,Stuart's suite is brand new  immaculately clean and spacious.  We were surprised at how very quiet it is.  The nearby Precita Cafe is a delight and the view from Bernal Heights (though it's a good walk up the hill) is stunning.  We didn't use the kitchen (there are many fun restaurants in several directions) but after seeing how well-stocked it is we'd do more cooking on future visits.
6922612,270238822,2018-05-28,145953537,Helen,Georgie was a wonderful host with many great local suggestions. We had some problems with our keys during the stay and she responded extremely quickly and helped us resolve it immediately. The place was very comfortable has incredible view and is a quick Uber ride to nearly everywhere. Highly recommend!
13810224,318469593,2018-09-03,44784961,Ellen,We enjoyed our stay here very much. The space is as exactly as pictured and described.  It was very comfortable and convenient for seeing my daughter who lives nearby. I  recommend Lochlann’s place wholeheartedly.

794626,349183450,2018-11-16,598057,Christie,"Justin was super accommodating and accepted my last minute reservation which was really awesome.

This is one of the more spacious AirBnBs with a full kitchen and two couch living room that I’ve stayed at in SF and for the current nightly rate it is a great deal - especially for families that would need more than one bed.  

Thanks again!"
13901641,319226547,2018-09-05,2935343,Thomas Leonardo,"Guanying home is very quiet situated in a very quiet area. 
Its possible to park your car and there at some fine restaurants in the neighborhood.
Guanying and his wife were very friendly and even took care of some trash we had brought from our stay at Burning Man. Thanks for that."
568161,3838625,2013-03-19,5276942,Tytus,"Great hosts quiet and high quality accommodations as advertised plus very convenient for public transport. 

Will definitely come back to visit in the future!"
13899875,486518947,2019-07-12,24716111,Pete,"Cheryl and her home are exactly what was promised: a charming representation of classic San Francisco architecture with thoughtful touches for travelers in a great location. 

I was visiting my home office a few blocks from Cheryl’s home and was offered a large quiet space for my downtime. Everything was perfectly clean and comfortable and Cheryl has added nice touches like a coffee and tea set and bottle water in the room. 

I ate dinner downstairs one evening and had great talks with both Cheryl as well as her niece Cierra and Cierra’s husband Mike. 

I would gladly stay here again and likely will when returning for work."
21866860,245539655,2018-03-22,175691269,Pui Lam,This place is PERFECT the house is newly refurbished and you can’t even tell it is a house built in 1884 in Victorian style. Besides the cleanliness and comfy design of the house Paula has been really helpful throughout our stay it was an enjoyment staying at her place!
1203526,457693935,2019-05-24,80752452,Kevin,Great location very clean
14153586,107821512,2016-10-12,35765611,Mary,The neighborhood has a lot close by.  You can walk down the street to Cinderella Bakery for coffee and food in the morning absolutely delicious!  Around the corner is Safeway and down the other side of the street is Golden Gate Park. Monica is very easy going and I felt like I was at my Aunt's house in Atlanta. Its quiet and peaceful. I will mention you have to climb 2 flights of stairs. There is a security gate to get in.  Its not fancy but functional for a safe place to sleep and keep your stuff. 
16556338,144439094,2017-04-15,120193307,韵韵,good view from the balcony
3079929,275242483,2018-06-10,26093290,Cameron,AMAZING apartment and the hosts go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable as possible.  And it has the best shower i have ever experienced..
7068804,45504860,2015-09-03,39036608,Joohyung,I really enjoyed staying at Sally's home. She's so kind and I feel home. The neighborhood is also nice very quiet and safe area. Two muni stations are close enough to walk. If I have a chance to visit SF again I would like to stay here again!
2221057,414122591,2019-02-18,238712279,Carmen,From the moment we walked in the place was very warm and inviting. Perfect place to stay close to the beach and away from the busy city life. But close enough to get to the busy city life and site see. Blythe and Michael were great host. Answered all questions and were very helpful. Would definitely recommend staying at their place.
164207,455558344,2019-05-19,24682951,朝駿,Phil is a very supportive host. He help us to solve problems all the time. Although we share a floor with Phil and Mary it just like a private unit if you want to be alone. The room is perfect that everyday I was waked up by the sunshine. The nearest station West Portal Station allows you to get into the downtown in 20 minutes and in the same time you can enjoy the silent neighborhood at night. There’s nothing to complain about this living experience. I would definitely choose the same place next time I go to San Francisco!
7009809,56201800,2015-12-10,5278185,Chelsie,The listing was lovely. It was left in perfect shape and we found all the notes Voula left very informative! I slept better than I have in ages in the master bedroom. Voula was a great communicator and is a fantastic Airbnb host. I would definitely stay here again. 
8685766,96674920,2016-08-23,65045536,Dominic,Our stay at the bunkhouse was in a good location and in the centre of downtown with shops a 2 second walk from the hotel and a 5 minute walk to market street. The room was clean and smart however the bed was not that comfortable we also had an issue in our room with heater and lights. We complained multiple times however they never did anything to fix the problem. Overall if your looking for a clean place in a great location that's cheaper than the average hotel in San Fran then this is a good place.
10437411,409415366,2019-02-07,1334534,Jamie,This studio is beautifully refurbished and ideal for one person or couple who want to be in Haight and Ashbury neighborhood. Everything is right there. Chip and Angela keep this place immaculate and are super easy to work with. I will be back!
11912034,251932839,2018-04-08,93120095,Shelley,A lovely clean and light space within a vibrant local community.  Great transport links across the city and right on the doorstep of Golden Gate park.  Fantastic shower comfy beds nice touches added and access to fridge kettle microwave etc very useful.  Hosts Dorothy and Rachel very responsive to questions.  Fab first air bnb experience! Thank-you x
72444,8368592,2013-10-28,5420550,Lauren,"What a perfect experience! This is definitely a FRIENDLY hostel. It was almost impossible to come and go without having a conversation about what you are up to where have you travelled. My interest was opera and all these youngsters were even interested in that! 

House rules call for ""quiet time"" between midnight and 8AM--there was never a problem with that. Rooms are clean. Bathroom/showers are clean. Kitchen/community areas are cleaned every day. There is always friendly staff on hand.

The location is great. Near Chinatown and walking direction from North Beach downtown Ferry Building lots of good transportation.

6272816,291403032,2018-07-15,7695008,Elyssa,Praise is an amazing host! Super sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. Her place is clean cute and in a good location. I would definitely recommend. 
6092596,456123734,2019-05-20,259434717,Jacob,Great location very clean. Hotel standard
10437411,271596470,2018-06-01,20075214,Mary,Apartment was great!  Easy walk to lots of spots!  Would definitely stay here again!
3325741,566539457,2019-11-19,63291707,Liz,Very clean felt like a hotel! Check-in was very easy which is a huge plus
38152019,545167867,2019-10-11,9266337,Sara,Showpiece! This place is absolutely beautiful. Very close to everywhere we needed to be in SF. My co-workers and I stayed and we all had our own bathroom. Would LOVE to stay again!
18981477,428250164,2019-03-24,31732215,Carly,Beautiful home! Great location and a wonderful stay.
8324569,195789068,2017-09-20,81162956,Sandy,Carl and Michael and very friendly and helpful.  The room provided was quite comfortable.  Their location is also great!
4184406,121739260,2016-12-18,33505225,Selene,Brian was definitely a 5 star host! From before our arrival he was checking with us and communicating about our stay. His place was no more than 5 minutes from a bus/rail station that could take us practically everywhere in the city. We chose to walk most of the days though. Lining our way home there were grocery stores and cafes and restaurants no more than 10-15 minutes. The street his house was on is quiet and we felt safe but has all the life you need a short walk away! Best of both worlds. His home is clean and spacious. He's so friendly with his coffee (which is spectacular) as well as all the other things he provides for his guests. My friend was a little worried about his cat but even his kitty was a great host! Never bothered us or scared my friend hahha. The other guests who also stayed there were super friendly and helpful to us. Brian we're going to miss your home and hospitality! Until next time! 
5272750,169809250,2017-07-13,16906811,Caitilin,We chose this place to stay because it was centrally located and we were only in SF for one night. Sarah was very prompt in getting back to us when we had questions. Unfortunately we had to cancel at the last minute so I cannot comment on the lodging itself but it has great reviews!!
23185870,469506134,2019-06-14,231037369,Jason,"Enjoyed my stay! Mary and her home were lovely. One small thing is that it can be a bit noisy if you have anything going on on the street outside. Besides that everything was as the listing made it out to be and I enjoyed my stay :-)

Thanks again Mary!"
8308630,275805871,2018-06-11,84347636,Mila,"I arrived very late 1am and Dominic was still very welcoming. He gave me additional comforter as I asked and even heater what was extra sweet of him and helped me a lot! Dominic is a great host!
House is old and quite. Shower and toilet separated."
6793767,108861029,2016-10-17,958802,Fernando,"It was a lovely stay. We just saw Janet the first day she was very helpful and nice and explained all of  our doubts.

Looking forward to stay with them again."
749744,20496343,2014-09-30,105051,Barbara,"We stayed at Camille’s place for the whole month of September as we relocated from MA and are looking for a place to stay. Camille’s place was very functional it comes with washer/dryer AND dishwasher which is pretty rare for this type of rental and very useful for long stays. The entry to the apartment (BTW- no keys necessary all doors have code access) is on the ground floor of the building then few steps down (about 8?) and there you are. In my view the place is not a one-bedroom but a big studio+a nook one side of the studio for the bed and sofa/TV and the other side for kitchen and dining table as well as the bathroom. There is one window in the bathroom and two windows and one glass door to the patio in the main room. The baby room is a nook in the corridor coming down from the entry door: there is heavy velvet curtain closing the nook and a proper door separating the studio from the corridor/nook which was ideal when putting our son to sleep and wanting to watch a movie. The studio opens up to the patio and to the garden shared with the neighbors: this means that every so often people do walk by the windows and they can actually see inside(unless of course you keep the curtains closed).
As other have said some appliances could need some updating (eg the knob of the dishwasher was missing and the dishwasher could be activated only using a Leatherman) but frankly everything was functioning and did not bother us at all. Although I cannot speak to the quality/functionality of it (as we brought our own gears) Camille does provide portable crib portable high chair and stroller to her guest. There were plenty of towels and bed linens as well as first necessity items (spices condiments detergents..). The place was spotless when we arrived.
The location is also good close to public transport connecting to the financial district but also close to the GG park and several other attractions.
Overall I’d recommend Camille’s place to anyone: even though on the small side it provided everything that we needed as we arrived in San Francisco. Thank you!
"
1506702,440360452,2019-04-20,16061208,Caroline,Ellen's apartment is a beautiful roomy space and a great location in San Francisco. The Golden Gate is visible from the back deck and everything is super comfortable.
23881290,260390054,2018-05-04,176227868,Kim,Erin’s home is amazing stylish peaceful and spacious and was perfect for my two night city stay. She’s super responsive and went above and beyond to make sure I had a great experience. It was bright spotless and welcoming and I felt very much at home. Can’t wait to book again for my next SF visit!
10835440,101450524,2016-09-13,28410524,Chrystel,"Chambre privée totalement indépendante avec sa propre salle de bain. Nous n'avons pas vu les propriétaires (peut être un peu dommage justement) mais ils sont très disponibles et répondent très rapidement si nous avons des questions ! 
Il y avait de quoi manger et boire dans le frigo très gentil de leur part. Concernant la localisation pas très loin des lieux touristiques en uber on en a eu pour 9$ environ à chaque fois pour se rendre au centre et une vingtaine de minutes ! Notre séjour s'est très bien déroulé ! "
18615032,358243353,2018-12-13,14297343,Francis,I loved staying at Rudy's place for the second time. I visited SF for work and was thrilled  to see that the apartment was available. It's stylish impeccably clean comfortable and in the best location. It's close to so many great spots. I highly recommend staying for business or leisure. Thanks for the great stay!
3946571,70667286,2016-04-19,9340241,Arlen,"My stay at Dr Lisa's wonderful ""walk-up"" Town Home was perfect from beginning to end.  Her home is so comfortable and beautifully decorated.  Light and airy with all the right touches.  The neighborhood was vibrant and filled with interesting restaurants and coffee shops.  Talking with Dr. Lisa about the history of the area and things San Francisco was a big plus.  I want to come back!"
7181279,486526643,2019-07-12,122231825,Brandon,"I enjoyed my stay at Kristin's place. Her studio apartment is perfect for a single traveler in the SF area. The checkin process was smooth and I appreciate her flexibility as my flight was delayed and I arrived late. 

I will say that the water pressure in the shower was not the greatest though I prefer a strong shower. It was certainly suitable for cleaning up but I would prefer it to be a bit stronger. Similar to other reviews there was quite a bit of noise coming from upstairs but not enough to wake me up or make me feel uncomfortable. 

Overall this is a very nice place to stay for a single traveler. I would recommend."
982298,439335586,2019-04-18,69308246,Jim,George’s place was the perfect one for family vacation. Spacious clean convenient and quite well located.
22487945,318490332,2018-09-03,52410806,Sarah,We had a good stay at Shaun‘s. The accommodation is in a modern house in a quiet and clear neighbourhood. We had everything we needed. You have to be aware that you are not the only guest. Sometimes we felt being at a hostel. Otherwise everything was good so far.
2965433,495280276,2019-07-25,76723920,Ashley,"My husband and I commented several times about how great the location was. We walked out the door and caught the trolley to Fisherman's Wharf we walked to the Exploratorium we walked to Lombard st there was a great little grocery store one block from the house and when my kids got tired we caught a cheap uber or lyft to anywhere we wanted to go. Lots of great restaurants within walking distance as well as a park for my kids to play at. 

The house itself was wonderful.  I was able to cook breakfast for everyone each morning and I was able to do laundry when needed. At night it was quiet and we all slept comfortably  despite being unaccustomed to living in a city atmosphere.  There was no AC but it was not needed - it got really cool at night.  My kids enjoyed watching TV to relax; they got all their favorite shows with the options available. 

Sharon was very accommodating and quick to respond.  She made sure to leave explicit instructions ideas on local places to eat and visit checked in on us to make sure we were doing well and was a great host overall. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to stay in San Francisco!"
562311,39587966,2015-07-24,5408717,Michael,One the the nicest places I have stayed via AirBnb.  Beautifully decorated and the balcony is excellent.  Highly recommend.
10840593,280235504,2018-06-22,42658539,高,"overall it is a nice place a bit loud in the morning when upstairs shop opens.

very nice coupleoffered us a few suggestions on parking but if you do want free parking it is uphill accross street very tricky on rear parking."
7845599,86107044,2016-07-15,15086526,Smithson,Merkley was a great host. What a cool place in a cool neighborhood in a cool city. Beautiful/interesting artistic touches everywhere in a grand Victorian house in lower Haight. The space was enough for the four of us and the fold out second bed was large a comfortable. The fridge was fully stocked with beer juice sodas coffee etc etc. I highly recommend this eclectic place for those who don't mind a funky atmosphere on a busy street. 
2942149,70988506,2016-04-22,5278318,Brandy,Our experience with Michael was great. A few of us were in town for business and couldn't have asked for more. Michael was responsive accommodating and all around awesome. The pictures looked just as advertised and our experience was great!
8275596,65995100,2016-03-18,6992230,Roger,"Rebecca has an eye for design and a fanaticism for cleanliness.  Every plant and there are a select few looks like a work of art.  The back balcony is truly a space of repose.

Entry to room is kind of funky."
377569,10845683,2014-03-10,12027664,Padmalaya,I had a great stay!  Cozy & comfortable room... Warm & friendly host!

The explanations were accurate and clear.
Very well-located: golden gate 5’ min (bus)/ downtown 20’ (bus) and loads of restaurants and market places at 5’ by foot
Everything you need in the lodge (even a red wine bottle at arrival)"

27056649,401732743,2019-01-15,77221723,Juyeon,James’ Place was very nice and clean. The private bathroom was also clean! Super easy to check in and check out. James is very responsive. Will definitely stay  if i visit here again. Highly recommend:)
23527874,335626268,2018-10-12,5323236,Tom,"Cozy room with a work space private sink/mirror comfortable bed and spacious closet. Bathroom (shower/toilet) is shared. Kitchen is shared. Everything was clean and as described in the listing. Love the decor and art spread throughout the house! 

Plenty of food options nearby (famous La Taqueria is nearby and I highly recommend it!)."

If I ever come back I will definitely stay with Kathy again"
9910056,77678931,2016-06-02,18289950,Steve,Great place in a great part of town.  Very convenient for what I needed and the restaurants nearby (Mochicha) were phenomenal.  Nice backyard for relaxing or yoga and easy late arrival with keyless entry.  As pics show studio has multiple levels so be careful if you have mobility issues... but then again you're in SF so that applies everywhere!  I'll be back!
1277771,23235347,2014-11-26,11909313,Jeanette,"Ich kann das ""Apartment in den Avenues"" absolut empfehlen! Wir waren zu viert im Apartment und haben uns total wohl gefühlt. Es ist bestens ausgestattet auch für einen längeren Aufenthalt. Die Wohnung ist sauber sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet die Wohnlage allerbestens. Man findet sogar in der Straße oder in fußnähe kostenfreie Parkplätze was in San Francisco nicht immer gegeben ist. Für einen Aufenthalt bei Jon & Christine benötigt man kein Auto. Mit dem Bus kommt man bestens überall hin. Wer Ausflugsziele sucht findet in der Wohnung sogar Mappen mit vielen Infos und Vorschläge vor. Nicht nur die Wohnung ist toll auch die Kommunikation Check-in... mit Jon & Christine hat bestens geklappt und war sehr nett. Beim nächsten San Francisco Besuch werde ich hier als erstes wieder anfragen.
Thumbs up for Jon & Christine! I can highly recommend your apartment. Thanks again! "

19180222,547707563,2019-10-15,3916946,Charles,Absolutely loved staying at Andrija’s apartment. Clean close to public transport routes and Pepe the cat was a bonus!
21345382,493622593,2019-07-22,8292817,Darcie,Susannah's place is beautiful bright full of artistic touches thoughtfully appointed and comfortable.  Noe Valley is a quiet and safe community near Downtown SF which has great cafes restaurants hiking/walking and beautiful Victorian cottages to oogle.
10767861,127732798,2017-01-20,10923075,Connor,Vishal is an amazing Host! His place could not be in a better more central location to explore SF. His communication was always top notch and he was warm and inviting from the onset. If you're lucky enough you will be able to hang out with his awesome dog Mahi. I will definitely stay again at Vishal's place the next time I am in San Francisco!
2396847,228238079,2018-01-18,32962848,Nancy,This place is really well equipped and the space is used efficiently. Appliances are up to date and everything works! I enjoyed my stay
23881290,547205420,2019-10-14,2784057,Marilyn,We booked Erin’s place for our in laws who were visiting from out of town. We could not ask for a more perfect place. The place was very clean and looked just like the pictures. Would definitely recommend to others!
28489872,563043468,2019-11-11,303905301,Terry,Great location.  Very clean and private space in a nice safe neighborhood.  Great restaurants in walking distance.
18765944,472483994,2019-06-19,3555006,Nicola,Victor Christiana were extremely helpful during my stay answering all my questions and allowing me to keep my bags there in between bookings whilst I was away on a tour. They kept the kitchen well stocked as well which was a bonus. Although a little out of the city it was very close to public transport so didn’t take long to get anywhere.
3883252,456902343,2019-05-22,75825827,Samo,Lauren is a nice kind person and everything was smooth as described. The appartment is a perfect safe place in that inspirational city around. Thank you Lauren!
21191232,293673175,2018-07-20,189041792,Valerie,"The place was clean and exactly as shown in the picture. The room is small and bright with 2 windows. Linens and towels were soft and beds were comfortable; bathroom was clean and the shower had nice water pressure.
Bus 29 stops right next to the house (but its not loud)
There was a small microwave and refrigerator.
Overall clean and pleasant and Marcia is quick to respond if you have questions."
21191232,571106438,2019-11-30,174733487,Catherine,Chambre très propre. Marcia répond très rapidement si vous avez des questions. Le logement bien qu'il soit situé à l'écart de San Francisco est très proche de nombreux transports en communs qui amènent dans le centre assez rapidement.
11620002,146729837,2017-04-23,11206489,Vladimir,"The best place to stay in SanFrancisco for a week I can possibly imagine. Not too far from downtown 10-15mins Lyft line and yet very quiet to isolate yourself after a busy day and hectic environment.
The apartments are clean and nice as described. Some bonus snacks was really cool to have after exhausting flight.
And Thuy is a great superhost who is easy to communicate with. Wish all hosts will be like you :)
Next time in SF we don't need to find another place to stay!"
8152867,236914814,2018-02-20,29209415,Clemens,Carol's a very nice and friendly host with a lovely little dog. My mistake was that I didn't read the description exactly: The room is as described behind the garage and not in the house. The only downside is the car park situation: if Carol's garage is full of two cars it is almost impossible to find a car park in the nearby area.
32414,109274,2010-10-01,13359,Brian,"Lisa's place was great. Beautifully kitted out and equipped with everything you could possibly need for your stay. Lisa was a great host and extremely helpful. She had prepared a wonderful booklet with tons of info on the area and San Fran in general. 

Bernal Heights is a really cool spot and Cortland street is filled with lovely laid-back restaurants and bars in which the food is delicious and the staff are charming (in particular Vega and Liberty Cafe). I suppose the only down-side is that it's a little bit removed from downtown. However we found that taking the bus along Cortland and getting on the J took us into the heart of the action in a little over a half hour and it's an interesting journey.

13642014,335667892,2018-10-12,7797577,Irene,A very warm and welcoming family that respect quiet hours and privacy; modern and functional furniture tinted with artwork from the owner; clean space that's very close to the muni local library Safeway Henry's Coffee (who makes delicious coffee) and many other places. I also usually prefer to cook my own food as much as I can and they offered open access to their kitchen as long as there was no frying or heavy cooking - not too many places offer you that.

593253,72299449,2016-05-01,51005604,Thea,This was my first experience with Airbnb - Trevor made it a great one.  He was nice friendly and welcoming and not at all intrusive.  The place was clean and in a nice central and quiet neighborhood.  Trevor was also flexible and accommodating to my early arrival and late departure.  
21125429,401480291,2019-01-14,176591132,Angie,A great place to stay in the city!  We enjoyed our stay and would recommend staying here to anyone!
11100926,477145655,2019-06-27,55001777,Ryan,Super little place located in the trendy Bernal Heights area. Nice and private bedroom/lounge/bathroom. Really easy to get into the town with local 14/49 buses just 5 minute walk away. Be sure to take a walk up Bernal Heights hill one evening to watch a super sunset over the city/bay!
27462045,340407114,2018-10-23,26014287,Alexandra,Great spot. Parking was easy and got to take advantage of moonrise views. Would recommend staying here!
1511076,356001734,2018-12-06,5147918,Jonny,"Simply put: this place can not be beat.
For one Jefferson and Gary are the BEST. They exude hospitality so naturally.
Plus their apartment is the coolest - great style + perfect location."

25749954,453753810,2019-05-16,226887980,Ingrid,Hola. La habitación era tal cual se ve en las fotos. Pensamos que la casa sería fría pero al prender la estufa no tuvimos frío para nada. La cama y almohadas cómodas también aunque hacía un poco de ruido. Muy bueno el escritorio para trabajar. Llegamos a la tarde y no nos cruzamos con otros huéspedes. Pudimos cenar y desayunar ahí. Muy buena relación precio/calidad.
1759087,52359551,2015-10-28,10429721,Ryan,Perfect spot and experience with my recent stay.  The place is in a good area easy to find and all logistics were clearly communicated to make it seamless.  I would definitely stay here again.

5861266,330529797,2018-09-30,26283366,Lawrence,Viviane & Lele’s place is very stylish situated a short walk from GG park in Richmond and a nice contrast to the hustle and bustle of downtown SF within easy reach of the GG bridge and the Pacific coast. Viviane & Lele are surer hosts very quick to respond on communications and checkin details. Would definitely recommend a stay here
34120816,483600042,2019-07-07,177262839,Sarah,Beautifully appointed condo and Ryan was super helpful and responsive.
2984463,530469349,2019-09-15,166108213,Elissa,Howard’s home is welcoming and cozy. He was there upon arrival to greet us and allowed us to contact him for any local suggestions. We felt safe in his home. Also the mattress was exceptionally comfortable!

- Location: 
It is a safe and beautiful neighbourhood and you can catch plenty of busses and the metro (N line) going downtown or elsewhere. I was travelling solo and I never felt unsafe even during the night when walking back to the studio.

- Food
There are some yummy places closeby: e.g. Bacon Bacon on Frederick Street (just walk down Ashbury) and along Cole Street (where the metro station is) there are quite a few restaurants too. Of course there are some more if you walk down to Haight Street.
There is a little convience store right at the corner Ashbury/Frederick St but remember there is only a little fridge in the studio no further kitchen supplies which I did not mind as I dined out anyway.

- Host: 
Miriam is nice and ready to help if you have questions; or like me catching a red-eye flight she let me store my luggage after check-out. She answers mails quickly too and is nice to chat with.

- Sleeper bed: 
The matress is rather hard but to me it was very comfortable. It is for 1-2 persons...

Con
- Cleanliness:
I had the feeling the room has not been thoroughly cleaned before my arrival. Bed and towels seemed okay though. The bathroom needs some serious work done however. In my opinion the shower had not been cleaned for a while and it is quite small so this might be a problem for a bigger person I guess. 
I also had some spiders in the room...on the bed*eeww*

- Noise
Anything that happens upstairs in the house is yours to hear i.e. any movement whatsoever phones ringing convos - you name it. Bring ear plugs!

- Privacy
This might have been a one-time incident but someone barged into the studio while I was sleeping (host cleaning lady?!) and I really did not like/appreciate it. 

- Photos
They are accurate with all lights switched on. The studio is located next to their drive way / garage and you won't get a lot of day light. But you'll be mostly out and about anyway. 

Conclusion
As mentioned the location is safe and great to explore the city and you won't be spending too much time in the studio anyway. As someone travelling solo the price is quite good too especially when you are visiting during a special time period (I was here during fleet week and hotel prices were even more exorbitant than usual) so this studio is an option. Not quite sure however if I would stay again. "
308885,162658876,2017-06-21,53577687,Laure,"Arbe was the most friendly hostess you could dream for! She came over at 10:30pm to switch the breaker as electricity had gone out. She researched comedy shows we could attend together. She was very kind and caring when I let her know I got hurt.
And most of all her place was spotless and facing a great bar/restaurant a short walk both from the financial district and the beach...
Arbe's flat is definitely a great fit for a business trip. Would recommend to anyone! Thanks Arbe!"
23615779,563108055,2019-11-11,232578435,Tori,"I loved this Airbnb and will definitely book again. The space was sparkling clean super close to SFSU in unit laundry/dryer and had driveway parking which is basically impossible to find in San Francisco. The driveway parking made our lives so much easier! It also felt very private like we had the whole place to ourselves thanks to the private entry. We basically had the entire ground floor all to ourselves.

It’s definitely roomy enough for 2 people; my boyfriend and I were surprised at how spacious it was. It also has a big backyard.

I loved that our host provided plates silverware and extra towels. The extra kitchen items were a lifesaver when eating our restaurant leftovers.

WiFi is super fast. I brought my PC for school and it worked smoothly.

The little space heater in the bedroom was also a lifesaver while staying in chilly SF weather.

I guess the only con about this space is that the walls are very thin. Footsteps water being turned on and doors opening/closing are very audible. But I’m a heavy sleeper so it wasn’t a problem at all."
57561,973686,2012-03-05,514143,Leksi,we had a nice stay at Theodore's apartment. Was as described very convenient location. Easy check in and out. 
23550791,484910835,2019-07-09,71226617,Jessica,Look no further. This is the BEST Airbnb experience I’ve had and Sat is the best Airbnb host I’ve had the pleasure of staying with. Sat was kind enough to allow me to check in at 1:30 am due to a late flight. She was extremely welcoming kind hospitable informative and responsive. She was out of town during our stay but was available through text and gave us recommendations for food and transportation. We had access to the kitchen; specifically the fridge plates/silverware and Keurig machine. Coffee light breakfast items and snacks were available. Sat even had homemade bread and cookies for us! They were delicious! Our space included a bedroom and an ensuite private bathroom. There was shampoo/conditioner body wash sun screen lotion etc. available for use. The space was immaculate especially the bathroom and that’s saying a lot because I have pretty high standards when it comes to cleanliness ;) The neighborhood was great and quiet. The location was not too far from San Fran’s main attractions. With the cleanliness personal touches amenities hospitality of the host and cost I was more than happy with my stay with Sat. My boyfriend and I found ourselves always looking forward to coming “home” to rest after a long day exploring the city. Sat you were wonderful :) thank you so much for allowing us to stay with you you made us feel right at home. We definitely fell in love with San Fran and your place!
21111630,506552235,2019-08-10,275446868,Sara,It is ideally located. The room is very large and clean even better than a hotel. Mary is a very nice person!! I would definitely recommend this place to you!
568161,3078584,2012-12-12,2267772,Reni,"Dear Beth dear Don
I enjoed my stay at your lovely place very much!
It was my first stay with airbnb and my first visit to the U.S.A and you were my first impression of your country and it could not be better! 
The room was exactly like on the advert – a very quite nice comfortable room – I slept very well! The place is only two minutes walking away from the Bart station. It is very easy to get to the center – 10 minutes with the Bart the ticket costs 175 usd. 
I would definitely come back to stay with you again. You are great hosts!
Best regards from the czech republic

13687255,142123753,2017-04-06,19706004,Lauren,Palmore's home was a lovely stay. One of my favorites in the many to San Francisco. The home is bright clean and beautiful. The views are outstanding and the kitchen was dreamy. I truly enjoyed my stay and would stay again. 
1511076,307572003,2018-08-14,2910630,Elissa,Jefferson and Gary's place is the perfect spot to stay in San Francisco. The location is ideal for exploring the city and indulging in the best food and coffee in the city. The space itself is great and provided plenty of privacy despite being a shared space in their home. Gary and Jefferson are friendly hosts who have created a warm and welcoming place for visitors. The flat is also well equipped with anything that you might need including emergency picnic supplies! I highly recommend staying here and will definitely reach out to stay again during my next trip to SF.
11191951,427478615,2019-03-23,85095541,Divya,Beautiful clean well appointed accommodation. Smooth check-in and hassle free communication. The place is bright with a comfortable bed and clean linen. Thoughtful touches throughout to ensure one has whatever they may need while travelling. The snacks/tea-coffee and cleaned utensils also add to one feeling at home. The location is great and all the spots in SF are within reach. Overall a wonderful gem of a place for anyone travelling to San Francisco. Recommended!

15567704,179811546,2017-08-08,121415911,Teri,This unit was just as advertised - beautifully furnished and conveniently located. While we didn't take advantage of public transportation it was just outside the door for anyone interested in that option. We relied on Uber to get around - and pick up and drop offs were very easy from this spot. Loved having Safeway just across the street. Also enjoyed two delicious meals within walking distance - and there were MANY more restaurants to choose from. This was the perfect place to land after a busy day of sightseeing and crowds - clean quiet and comfortable. The delicious treats Vannida provided were an added bonus.

1229606,23060688,2014-11-22,20363319,Heath,John was extremely hospitable. I accidentally broke a lamp fixture and John responded like a pro. He provided a six pack in the fridge a bottle of wine and some extra snacks throughout the place. The layout of the place is really nice it's modern and had everything I needed. What you see is what you get and I would absolutely recommend it if you're staying in the area.

Problem with cable and CARTER came over straight away and sorted it. Woukd definitely stay again.

2557977,49856579,2015-10-06,35569828,Mike,I can't say enough good things about Eoin as well as his place.  Didn't have a chance to meet Susie during our stay but Eoin was a great host.  Really patient answering all our questions and has really put together a lot of detailed info and tips about the neighborhood.  Neighborhood is great as well lots of restaurants conveniently located and has a lot of character.  Bottom line if you're looking for a place to stay in San Francisco look no further.  Thanks Eoin (and Susie) for a great stay.

5317789,32998239,2015-05-24,5180734,Gale,Josiane has created a beautiful home in one of the most convenient and charming neighborhoods in San Francisco. Street parking (a miracle in SF) nice  shops and cafes book store etc. are a short walk away.  The room is comfortable and serene as is the rest of the house which is beautifully decorated and edited in gorgeous colors that are set off by the  kelly green and lavender garden outside a charming place to have a cup of tea. Josiane is extremely welcoming a great conversationalist and knowledgeable about the best San Francisco has to offer. Staying with her is a thoroughly delightful experience.

Would highly recommend!

It's a great opportunity to meet new people and to immerse yourself in the SF culture while still feeling at home.

The keyless entry was particularly helpful since it was a group of us and made coming and going on our own schedules a breeze. The owner was responsive to questions and gave clear instructions on Wi-Fi and other features of the home. The kitchen was well-equipped which meant we had the option of cooking in when we felt like it. Overall this was a very good Airbnb experience and I’d definitely rent this property again.

16535678,189434734,2017-09-01,3262353,Greg,"I have stayed in many Airbnb's around the world and can say with confidence that this was my favorite and best stay!

First off the location is perfect.  It's in a cute neighborhood called Cole Valley which has a ton of great restaurants shops cool little neighborhood grocery store an incredible breakfast spot (Zazie) and some fun bars (Kezar and Finnigans Wake) all within a 5 minute walk. It's also close to the N Judah public transportation line that can get you downtown or anywhere else you want to go in the city. 

Second the apartment is beautifully appointed spacious and clean. The apartment is stocked with everything you need and has a great desk for getting work done if you're traveling on business. The cherry on top is the oversized and modern bathroom with incredible shower water pressure. It's also very quiet and secluded with access to a grass backyard (imagine that!). Finally the hosts were incredibly gracious and accommodating. They were very responsive and communication was great throughout the entire process. I travel to San Francisco often for work and I think I've just found my new home away from home for work!"
14990478,205631534,2017-10-22,9468571,Petra,Sehr ruhige Lage trotz Nähe zum Freeway. Nicht so wirklich nah an den Sehenswürdigkeiten aber mit Mietwagen kein Problem. Kommunikation mit den Gastgebern lief reibungslos. Bett ist sehr gemütlich und Ausstattung ist sehr umfangreich für die Ladies: es gibt sogar ein Glätteisen
1810486,14607601,2014-06-23,14247548,Linda,Great location!. Walking distance to alamo park and bus routes easy to access for other parts of the city. Huge home older but wanted to stay in the old victorian type home. The home had everything you needed no need to bring anything. Parking space was a heaven sent for those driving up. Definitely will stay again!
17718199,185481873,2017-08-21,140819014,Travis,Great place to stay. Very clean. Very accommodating. My wife and I had a very pleasant experience and would recommend staying here.

About the place: it’s  no more than a 15min-20min drive to anything you want to visit in SF. The place is very charming and her garden is a beautiful place for breakfast and photos.
We would recommend the place to any couple or person looking for an easy comfy stay in SF!"

14125,493016,2011-09-01,857895,Michelle,We stayed at Olivia's apartment in August 2011. The apartment is perfectly located in the Mission for getting around the city on the Muni and was very conveniently located near the BART for easy access to SFO. There are so many different restaurants to choose from within walking distance that you could literally eat your way around the block! The apartment itself is beautifully decorated with all the little comforts of home. Olivia was a great host!
3122882,329392756,2018-09-28,195397418,Cathy,Kara and Todd were wonderful hosts whos home was warm and welcoming!  They provide many small details I would never get staying at a hotel.  I highly recommend staying with them and their pup Tucker!!

The room was stylish clean and comfertable. The wifi worked great. And there was fruit and a danish in the room plus a mini fridge. Im always rushed in the morning so it was great to have something easy for breakfast. Check in was very smooth. Very excellent stay!!!!
13603043,217110922,2017-12-07,154974457,Carolyn,Tucked away in a walkout basement this apartment is inviting colorful and beautifully decorated.  It gets morning sunshine so it feels bright and airy despite its basement location.  There's a patio with a little table and chairs which makes a pleasant spot to work or drink a glass of wine outside.  The small efficient kitchen is adequate for one guest or a couple to make simple meals.  The gas fireplace takes the chill off San Francisco evenings and Shal and her partner are equally warm and friendly!  Perhaps most important for travelers keen on sightseeing or getting around town for work:  You're a short (though steep) walk from the J-line streetcar.  Lovely Noe Valley's main shopping/dining street is also just a couple of blocks away and has a Wholefoods good coffee places etc.  Highly recommended.
7290262,240400732,2018-03-04,54119847,Babs,Trevor’s place provided everything you could ever need or want. Trevor himself is a friendly down to earth local who has plenty of great tips. What I liked most about staying at this Airbnb was the location. The neighborhood was just quiet enough to find peace but close enough to all the nightlife and restaurants. It’s really the best of both worlds! Be sure to take some time to enjoy the patio!
17318005,164251090,2017-06-26,79508619,Maria,Lovely place within walking distance to many local restaurants.  It was right next to a dog park and public transit.  The place was clean and had all of the amenities that I needed. Check in was smooth and Susan's son Matt was able to help with any questions that I had.

Very residential with good coffee shops and the beach within walking distance. Steven and Molly were very easy to communicate with and check in and check out was a breeze. While there was a wind machine provided even at high volume it was easy to hear all moment upstairs and very early in the morning. Other than that it was a great stay! 
20739989,327954232,2018-09-24,199715203,Steffan,Gordon is an excellent host a local who loves his city and want to make his guest see San Francisco from its best side.

1633839,538375445,2019-09-29,22352072,Aurora,"Great place! 

We checked in was super quick. The place itself was super cute and had a lot of great perks. There was some basics in the fridge for us basic bathroom essentials (toilet paper towels hand soap shampoo/conditioner etc). 

The view was great from the main bedroom. The kitchen was cute & I loved the big wooden table. 

Location was so close to a few markets taquerias coffee places etc. So it was a quick 5 minute was to grab coffee & donuts. 

I would recommend this place to anyone looking to explore SF Mission district! 

Of course there was no parleying but the host send us a parking garage to park before hand. It was cheaper then the average lots but also super close to the house."
1931788,405771135,2019-01-27,61418160,Mark,Jim’s place is a gem. After staying a few days downtown I enjoyed checking out Mission.  Jim is helpful and a great host.

3333870,23291700,2014-11-28,21407070,HarveyAndLynne,"This was our first Airbnb experience and I must say I did not know what to expect. The photo of Nancy's studio does not do it justice. As you can see it is a cute and bright room. What the photo does not convey is it's cozy warmth and charm!  I was immediately impressed by all the ""little things"" that made a big difference. A very comfortable bed cute back porch fridge expresso machine unique art work and wide variety of books and CDs sightseeing maps and brochures of local points of interest ...especially food! And our host Nancy was extremely welcoming and helpful as we navigated the surrounding neighborhoods and the city.  We would not hesitate staying there again in the future."

20933318,243676943,2018-03-16,56700560,Gioia,Annie's Cottage is wonderful.  Everything in her place is comfortable and well done. We loved the porch the quiet and the gardens. The location is amazing.  Annie suggested places to eat which were excellent (Leopold's Lemongrass and ZA's) and that we could walk to easily.  There were excellent small grocery stores a short walk away on Polk St and Hyde St.  We enjoyed walking to Lombard Street North Beach and taking the cable car which is right around the corner yet it is so quiet and peaceful at her place.  My daughter enjoyed giving treats to her kind dog Bentley. Thank you for a great stay.  We look forward to returning!
3850,548102491,2019-10-16,38590052,Liam,Kevin is a fantastic host with a lot of good tips for visiting the city. The house is in a great location close to public transport. The provided food is a wonderful touch and I would highly recommend anyone to stay there.
1627455,23920969,2014-12-14,5871573,Allison,Paul's apartment is exactly as described in the listing - clean comfortable and centrally-located.  Paul was very responsive throughout the whole process and made check-in easy giving me an apartment tour and making sure I could work the keys in the doors.  The building is very secure with two locked doors at the main building entrance.  The room was big for just one person and was pretty quiet during my stay with very little outside noise.  Finally I loved the location!  I took advantage of the quick walk to Union Square and also caught the cable car just a couple blocks away.  Overall I enjoyed my stay and would recommend this listing to anyone!

4909117,152305070,2017-05-15,69030851,Chase,Comfortable bed! Very clean! Private bathroom great! One negative - it's in the tenderloin and just one block over is a pretty sketchy area.
713877,456091508,2019-05-20,70096532,Peter,Stylish place with great view deck and fabulous neighbourhood near everything including Golden Gate park. Very comfy beds. Instructions are clear easy check-in. A few outside steep stairs to climb to get to suite but that was anticipated. Excellent hostess fast to respond
15769324,181424453,2017-08-12,128767997,Devyn,Great central location right near one of the main streets. The room was clean and bed was comfy. The shower wasn't the greatest - not much water pressure and and sometimes smelly as the floor shares one bathroom and shower but apart from that it was a great value for money stay and the staff were really friendly.
10648093,296431608,2018-07-25,187140727,Chris,Clean easy to find easy to get in comfortable and quite stylish. And 3 fireplaces!!

9489347,100533570,2016-09-09,63007329,Jessica,Rob was not there when we arrived but left  detailed instructions on entering the flat.  The flat is in the lower back of the house so it was very quiet from neighborhood noises.  We were there with our 3-year-old and it was a decent set-up for travel with a small child.  The apartment was meticulous and as described; unfortunately I'm the only coffee drinker in the family and I failed to sample Rob's home-roasted beans.  For the activities we had planned it very well located in relation to bus lines.  There are grocery stores within a good walking distance including a Trader Joe's as well as a Target.  Rob gave us a comprehensive list of restaurant recommendations and we were pleased with every one that we tried that he'd also mentioned.
25463,32158129,2015-05-15,25942482,Nicole,"Patrick est venu nous accueillir  même si notre vol avait été retardé et que nous sommes arrivées passé minuit. Il a été très charmant et nous a bien indiqué le fonctionnement de son appartement .

13066842,116064061,2016-11-27,92808044,Jeanne,This is a lovely private home in a nice residential area with some shopping areas within  walking distance although hilly.  There is also a parking garage which is very helpful.  The place is beautifully furnished and well maintained.  One negative - they have an expresso machine but no coffee maker however you can get coffee a block away.  
1940496,257879336,2018-04-27,39439088,Andrew,Bar's place is a great find in a desirable SF neighborhood. He made the check-in process super smooth. There is so much to do around the neighborhood. I would definitely consider staying again on future trips to the city.
14488234,563682130,2019-11-13,15695574,David,Super convenient check-in and location was superb. Close to muni in a great neighborhood of SF. I will be back! Thank you.
38430549,563124934,2019-11-11,120266762,Gemma,"David is a fantastic host and I loved staying in his flat. It is centrally located - I could easily walk to Hayes Valley the Mission District the Castro.. and there were cute coffee shops and what not in the neighborhood. David’s flat is on the main floor of a house (3 stories?) and is decorated with a ton of art. He provided me with a ton of material on San Francisco but was also more than happy to share tid bits with me when we crossed paths. Be mindful that there are two rooms that are rented out and the bathroom is shared which was more than fine. My room was very cozy and beautifully decorated. there was no natural light but it was great for sleeping and I was out most of the day anyway. The living room is flooded with great light and outside the kitchen is a cute patio with plants. 
I cannot wait to come back for another visit and stay with David. It is a great value."

18767723,278792508,2018-06-18,164033867,Pietrix,"Kamer B is niet erg groot maar juist daardoor gezellig en knus. Voor 1 persoon helemaal goed. Alles is aanwezig: handdoeken föhn shampoo etc maar ook flesjes water snacks en eetgerei.  Als je iets mist kun je dit aangeven. De verhuurders zijn erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam. 

Omdat het een woonhuis is zijn de andere gasten soms wel goed te horen. Met oordopjes heb ik toch goed kunnen slapen. De locatie is wat verder weg van het centrum dus je moet wel een stukje met het ov voor de meeste bezienswaardigheden. Hier staat tegenover dat het een rustige en veilige buurt is. In de informatiemap gaven de verhuurders aan dat Powell street station een goede toegang geeft tot het centrum. Bij dit station liepen echter heel veel verwarde dakloze mensen rond waardoor ik me niet veilig voelde. Misschien beter om daar niet uit te stappen. Andere plekken voelen wel veilig aan. Ook 's avonds met het ov vond ik geen probleem. 

De verhuurders gaven gedetailleerde informatie over hoe je de kamer kunt bereiken met ov taxi en uber (en hoeveel het ongeveer kost) en ook bv over waar de supermarkt en restaurants zitten. Erg handig! Zelf inchecken is ook makkelijk."
18767723,234181455,2018-02-11,58808841,玥,We are very grateful for the accommodation. Very clean and quiet. We will consider this place again next time.

10767861,191017023,2017-09-05,144684804,Clare,"Vishal was an amazing host. He is very friendly  accommodating and very knowledgeable about the city and things to do. He gave us a lot of suggestions that was very useful on our trip. Mahi is the cutest adorable calm dog. The place was very clean comfortable well maintained and closed to everything. We really enjoyed the city and will definitely comeback again. This place is highly recommended!

17097361,550987552,2019-10-19,122036939,Lior,Simran's place is a great find in the city. Comfortably located relatively quiet and enjoyable. Simran was very kind and helped with whatever I requested. Highly recommend.
5299461,269625268,2018-05-27,176957166,Sasha,A very lively and fun place to stay as a solo traveler! Great location just close enough to downtown but away from the noise. The only down side is as soon as you get to be friends with everyone staying there with you they move on!
9905129,187196834,2017-08-26,109330968,Michael,"I'm always a bit weary when looking at pictures as pictures can make a home nicer than it is BUT this home shows BETTER in person than in the pictures. It is very spacious and well taken care of. A lot of thought went into this home. We had a family of five. It was great for cooking in but also conveniently close to great shops and restaurants. We especially enjoyed the proximity to Golden Gate Park not to mention the park just outside the front door. 

I would be remiss if I didnt mention what a great host Elizabeth was. Prompt at answering questions/replying to emails and giving us some pointers on the area. 

I would highly recommend staying here."

2178509,42659771,2015-08-15,30916787,Allie,"Staying at Gregg's was an enjoyable experience. We felt right at home. His place is lovely and the location was great. Although Gregg was unable to be with us he left us in good hands with his friend who was a gracious host. 
The hospitality and generosity shown by Gregg during our visit was very appreciated. This was my first experience with Airbnb and I am happy to say I would recommend that anyone looking for a nice place to stay while in San Francisco ought to consider Gregg.
Thank you again Gregg!"
13641058,107194235,2016-10-09,58339843,Kelly,Joseph was so sweet! We came in to SF a bit earlier than expected and he allowed us to check in earlier. He had printed out ready with the nearest tourist locations and food spots near his location. His got all the seasoning if y'all wanna cook too. His location isn't a bad place to be at it was close to the heart of things; Chinatown is walking distance from his apartment. His bed A1. His art A1. Everything A1. Thank you Joseph! 
992913,3858118,2013-03-21,5461916,Maria,It was an amazing stay. Greg was a wonderful host. He left chocolates out for us upon our arrival. Just a very generous guy and great to talk to. He also took the time to direct us to a delicious pizza joint close by. The location was perfect close to restaurants bars and a short-ish 20 minute walk to all the Piers. Greg also allowed us to check out late which made our life a lot easier. 
16088064,138680921,2017-03-20,104140309,Jackie,The location was in walking distance of the majority of things! 
10594703,89232791,2016-07-27,81952832,Cathleen,"Mari was very accommodating. The room was private with a comfortable bed. Her cat is friendly and affectionate. There's a market conveniently located across the street.
There are a few homeless people who hang out on her street but I had no issues with them.
On my next visit to San Francisco I will look up Mari's scheduled openings."
992913,31343571,2015-05-04,21900145,JC & Carien,This was a great location and within walking distance of everywhere we needed to be. Gregory was very helpful and welcoming. It is an old building but that is typical of many places in San Francisco. We only stayed one night and had to leave early again the next morning. Great place for the location and if you just need a room for sleeping. 
21082676,565719586,2019-11-17,1208572,Felipe,Jonathan was so kind and helpful with local tips and the bedroom and bed are really comfy. Totally recommend! Thank you for making my stay so good :)
17696905,275283619,2018-06-10,13287322,Michelle,Such a quintessentially SF experience though we missed the communal dinners :( really enjoyed the private room and the convenience Tobie was super accessible and the third floor lounge is pretty cool!

7922690,155785006,2017-05-28,114751477,Fathema,離電車400公尺房子非常乾淨二位都非常友善及配合大力推薦
3261876,80989746,2016-06-20,34811964,Maria,The room was in an excellent location - close to all the major tourist attractions as well as the local bars and restaurants. Josh made sure we were comfortable with our stay from the beginning to the end and was very accommodating. Would definitely stay again!
8272458,340364439,2018-10-23,213369151,Donna,At Rafe's place you can expect convenient accommodation close to 24th St shops and restaurants and a short walk from Whole Foods.  The apartment is ground level  and access is easy.  It has a spacious living area with TV and a small counter with microwave coffee maker and bar fridge.  The bedroom and bath are located behind this living space separated by a door.  The bed is super comfortable!  This apartment is functional  clean bright and quiet located in a lovely residential area.   Rafe is a very conscientious host.
720811,340091767,2018-10-22,14784710,Katherine,"Great home base for visiting friends in San Francisco. Comfy bed! Great sleeping with open windows and quiet neighborhood. 
Good nearby restaurants.
We used Uber and had rental car so can’t comment on public transportation .
Would definitely re-book!"
9752333,250610639,2018-04-05,16831590,Derek And Joanne,What a beautiful abode! Clever use of the space — love the natural light! Will definitely be back.
19478755,532951146,2019-09-20,56731343,Victoria,Kathy was a lovely host and super friendly - welcomed us late at night when we arrived with tea which was really nice. Apartment is clean and comfortable with everything you need!
12270048,262999445,2018-05-10,135849777,Mikaela,Very cute clean easy to access room! Private entrance was perfect and the space was decorated very cute. Would stay here again!
21486593,414744885,2019-02-20,116083939,Mélissa,Propreté à désirer. Quartier douteux mais bien placé tout de même. Voisin agréable.
5852066,501493642,2019-08-03,48180847,Barbara,This is such a great place to stay. The home is lovely and so well cared for. Paul is friendly flexible and easy to work with. I loved the location as Alamo square is beautiful and there’s lots of fun restaurants in the area. I would stay again. Thanks Paul
109883,190741129,2017-09-04,80322551,Sarah,Adam's place is quiet and relaxing. He was such a great host. The neighborhood was absolutely beautiful and the parking right in front of the house was a real bonus.
208831,60115071,2016-01-19,4784657,Tami,Peter and Paula were very friendly and helpful hosts. They were extremely responsive to the few issues we had within the home; the location is fantastic and the space itself is comfy and spacious. The  shower pressure is great and heater runs perfectly especially during the cold rainy weather. The kitchen is very roomy well-appointed for meal prep. 
4321720,100598419,2016-09-10,32010955,Ella,Michael and novo are very friendly hosts! They were very clear about the instructions and helped us out for late arrival. The house is very clean and modern. The room is good enough for two people and many storage spaces. Even though the bathroom is not ensuite it is next to our room only for our own use. The mill coffee shop is just 0.1 mile away! Had nice time playing with Max! (Michael and Movi's pet) The neighbor is quiet which is good for our good sleep! They have hairdryer. For drivers it is best to park at the DMV parking they only charge parking from 5pm-7am. At the night you may have to wander around the neighborhood a bit. Perfect safe location made my stay very comfortable and had lots of nice memories. 
21591469,280662635,2018-06-23,56220306,Arsh,Highly recommended.  Nice and clean place with excellent host.
23830079,488899427,2019-07-15,179996109,Jakob,The apartment is in a nice and quiet neighborhood. It is very modern and close to the beach. It is ideal for a short stay in San Francisco.
12905538,415095235,2019-02-21,231529983,Daniel,Freya’s place was a cute little place for a very affordable price. She’s very flexible with everything and we had a wonderful stay.
4191242,107237910,2016-10-09,2702005,Mark,My second time staying  here and just as enjoyable as the first. Leo on Veronica were great hosts staying in contact regularly and very flexible with everything related to my stay.  A wonderful property in a great location within easy access of downtown San Francisco (20 min walk) and in the heart of the bustling North Beach area. Highly recommended on all fronts.
18548006,460261325,2019-05-28,4959423,Peter,A very smooth check in process and very good communication with Scott. We stayed in the unit with our toddler which worked really well. Scott was very accommodating in providing a crib and the bedroom was large enough to fit the crib comfortably allowing us to use the living area at night. The local area has some good food options as well - especially the Craftsman and Wolves coffee shop! Parking wasn’t an issue and it was just 20 minutes into downtown by car (on the weekend). Highly recommend this place!
30355764,461501805,2019-05-31,255271450,136****077,很好的房间!房主非常非常的细心提供的东西可以看出她很热爱生活｡唯一的遗憾就是我们停车被贴了罚单｡
14773204,344067796,2018-11-02,22212896,Maddy,I really enjoyed my stay with Pete and Jon - they were super communicative and accommodating and their place was lovely and well-equipped! In the heart of the mission fun eclectic SF location despite being a bit rough around the edges. I would absolutely come back thank you guys!
10040637,66058232,2016-03-19,2268949,Elyse,My parter and I enjoyed our stay at The Mission B&B. This place truly is right in the heart of the Mission!  Aside from the part where we made a ruckus by dragging 5 rolling suitcases down the sidewalk we were able to fit right in and feel like locals. The bed was comfortable and the room was quite large just as pictured. I think the best part was Philz coffee right across the street.
1925714,27535817,2015-03-07,5365121,Nathalie,Communication was very good even though I didn't meet David in person. The apartment is charming and quiet and a cleaning service comes once a week. To reach it you need to take small stairs passing a little garden smelling a good smell of nature and hearing birds. The neighborhood is charming too with all the big hills (but the apartment is not on one of them so it's less painful for our legs :)). There was no washing machine but I went to a laundry 10mn walk from the apartment. The balcony was nice too even though the sun reaches only a small part of it. My boyfriend and I had a great time there thanks !
1125115,117357966,2016-12-06,52346592,Andrew,Great place super nice family great people.

24449972,440360529,2019-04-20,63044592,Apolline,Great appartement ! Very clean good location ! We had a great time! Thanks Margo!
17285258,337839631,2018-10-17,48550411,Dawei,Lovely place! Exactly like described minimal deco but you got all the things you need and they all in the right place where u need them. Very well thought out! Very responsive host management. There is no washing machine inside but laundry is 5min by walk.
13263750,287970076,2018-07-08,21118107,Connor,Well priced for SF and close to most things. Rooms are basic but do the job! Everything is as it says
6107359,79844548,2016-06-14,61965513,David,It was a very pleasant stay Pete even gave me a information about residential parking in SF. The apartment was also very clean and the way to open the front door was easy.
918341,38146144,2015-07-13,4343789,Jennipho,"Kepa - greeted us upon arrival and made us feel very welcome! Their accommodations actually exceeded the descriptions on the listing. We were pleasantly surprised when we got there.  The garden escape was beautiful and the location peaceful with views of the city and walkable cafes/restaurants. I would definitely stay again! 

I only wish we could've stayed longer this trip."
12172311,445687945,2019-04-29,610340,Ingrid,Very good communication with Arpita and detailed instructions for check-in. The place was clean and comfortable. The trip on the L train downtown (buy your pass online through the app as it’s cheaper and more convenient) can be long but it is an interesting experience to see different neighbourhoods and watch people. We found an Asian supermarket with wonderful and very affordable food (and drinks) in walking distance.
15812013,206292303,2017-10-24,107481808,Gaye,Kamal is such a nice host.  Very knowledgeable with information for getting around the city.  The view from his balcony is awesome.  His home is filled with many great photos of the scenes of San Francisco.  Ideally located close to everything one may need to see. Maybe it was just the time of year but our room was very hot.  With the windows open it is extremely noisy. He offered ear plugs but I can't sleep with ear plugs in. Great host and so nice.
19586208,286237633,2018-07-05,156351850,Heli,This place was a very convenient stay for me as I transitioned to move to SF. I’ve been here for 7 months and extended my stay because of the location price and available amenities. At this spot you have enough room to be yourself great location to explore in the city and you’ll also be able to make some cool friends because of the co-living situation. If your looking for a fair priced shared room situation and a place to get work done hang out and network then i would highly recommend this location. 
2927781,260379489,2018-05-04,44940951,Tobias,I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Charles and René are awesome and very welcoming hosts. I admire with how much love their home is designed. Very recommended!
1107014,252463006,2018-04-10,10686163,Philipp,Breathtaking views of the city. Great location a fun walk up to Twin Peaks. Fantastic communication and easy check-in/out. Definitely recommend!
8869066,316191079,2018-08-30,194718981,Rachel,This is a great place to stay if you are visiting SF to get out and explore. It’s exactly as described. The shower is exceptional. It’s small but functional and very clean. Andrew and his family live above (the apartment is the ground level unit) and noise will definitely be heard from their house.
32703565,496676358,2019-07-27,68260649,Riley,Good location and decent place. Right in the middle of the city but not as nice as the pictures. Still a good place.
23025299,538527456,2019-09-29,142788573,Cato,Returning guests. Only place in the  Bay we will stay at when there is availability.  Place is just as awesome as last time. Rachel provides everything you could need in your room. If not  she is really close to Walgreens and freeway.  Will definitely return.
8117667,82663470,2016-06-28,69823232,Sara,This was the perfect location for me while visiting family in the Inner Sunset. It was within easy walking distance of restaurants shops the N-line and Golden Gate Park. The host and hostess were friendly and helpful. The accommodations exceeded my expectations. 
1578597,17224126,2014-08-09,18048900,Susannah,Not only was Jon-Pierre a fabulous host but the accommodations were perfect for a weary business person to come home to a quiet neighborhood with easy access to Whole Foods nearby.  I was able to prepare simple meals get a good nights sleep and go about my work week with no problems.  My only regret was not having a glass of wine with Jon-Pierre!  Next trip!
7421008,202736337,2017-10-12,150305800,Kylan,Convenient and comfortable accommodations close to everything in the city.  We couldn't have picked a better location  and Fiona was an excellent and kind host who was very helpful but unobtrusive at the same time.  Would definitely stay again the next time we are in San Francisco.
1989997,111549895,2016-10-31,85376184,Daniel,A real treasure in the heart of the Haight and I'd say a quitessential San Fran experience.  Michelle and Jeffery are super hosts and full of interesting stories facts figures generosity and fine food. 
34937940,552460385,2019-10-21,172080878,Drew,Great place to stay!
20575733,405218576,2019-01-26,62127537,Thom,"Clean space but bed is pretty small. I’m 5’11” and my feet hung off the end of the bed.
There are no TV radio or clock in the room.
This is a bedroom in a house with wood floors and is right next to the kitchen. If you’re a light sleeper the noise from the kitchen could be bothersome (especially if people choose to use a speakerphone late at night as did in our case).
You are not allowed to wear shoes in the house so be prepared to take them off at the front door.
Parking is pretty difficult in this area. If you’re (very) lucky you may find a regular street parking spot. Otherwise you may need to walk a block and try to park in a metered spot which is about $2.50/hr. (Free from 6:00pm-9:00am)."
23054267,561618790,2019-11-09,137885997,Luis,Great stay would book again
7989636,563115544,2019-11-11,144360900,Celest,Lindy’s apartment is the perfect place to explore the city from and a cozy home away from home with really cute personal touches and a super comfortable bed. Tucked within the quiet neighborhood on Nob Hill it’s a 20-30 min. stroll to Fisherman’s Wharf 15 min. on foot to Chinatown Cable Car Musuem and more! Of course you can take a Lyft/rideshare anywhere but I pretty much walked everywhere. Lindy is a very friendly and easygoing host. She stays on premise with her cat Sophie so be sure to enjoy a nice chat while you’re there. Bonus: The views from Lindy’s living room is simply mindblowing (both in the morning and evening). I would definitely stay here again! Thank you Lindy!
16134193,438890222,2019-04-17,89187320,Heike,Perfect place to stay if you want to be right in the centre.
2956406,162825358,2017-06-22,92456729,D,Simon and Joan were gracious hosts who offered those little touches that make all the difference. Simon was helpful and knowledgeable. 
238190,79208452,2016-06-11,59241399,Winston,"Description accurate. The location can't be more convenient: 3 min walk from bus stops and cable car stops that lead to downtown; 1 mile from the Fishermen's Wharf to the north few blocks from the crooked street on Lombard St. to the east and 15 min jog from the Coit Tower to the west. 

The host Bill is more than hospitable. I had trouble getting in he called me back to help in 10 min. He offered me milk cereal and beer in his fridge though I only took the milk. 

"
2046634,275770947,2018-06-11,32718514,Matthew,This is a lovely room in a great location - 2 minute walk from buses that will take you straight downtown or a couple of blocks from Fisherman’s wharf. Kevin and Kenix were friendly and hospitable hosts replying promptly to any queries we had. The bed was super comfy and the private bathroom has a fantastic shower! Recommended
3030653,77442867,2016-05-31,44298,Amy,We loved our stay here! The place was in an amazing location and was cute and clean. We had everything we needed! Thanks so much 
3114387,132077903,2017-02-15,12291976,Michael,Julie is super caring and responsive she always made an extra effort to make our stay awesome. The apartment is very close to the Muni train and you can easily get to the city center. It is extremely spacious and the beds are very large.
14341440,485938888,2019-07-11,5060621,Rikke,"We loved the stylish quirky interior of this perfect Mission location. The beds were incredibly comfy and the textiles soft and beautiful. The whole place had a wonderful warm and inviting feeling and was very clean and tidy.
The kitchen was well-stocked and there were many thoughtful touches throughout the apartment.
As others have mentioned the owner lives upstairs and has several dogs. This is not necessarily an issue (it wasn’t for us) however potential renters should be aware that there is at times some commotion on the back deck and stairs. We woke up at 6am every day when the dogs did...
During the night the place and surrounding area was wonderfully quiet though. 
We had no issue finding parking another major city bonus!"
21847778,432360380,2019-04-03,81286014,Destinee,"Andy’s home was a hit for me! 

- Location — Andy’s home is central to all of SF’s tourist sights (Twin Peaks Mountain airport downtown Fisherman’s Wharf etc); making Lyft and Uber rides inexpensive and quick. Parking is difficult to come as most of all SF parking is but if you drive around the block 2/3 times you’ll eventually grab a spot near the house. 

- Safety/privacy* — The home has a private gate that requires a code to enter the front porch / door). The door itself to the home also requires a code so checking in / out isn’t a hassle. Your private room also has a code different to the other rooms allowing you comfort to lock your door. 

* Neighborhood Safety: I was parked at the intersection north of Andy’s home and accidentally left my window half open over night. When I came to my car the next morning I was relieved to find that no one had touched it. 

- Amenities — Andy provides all the expected amenities/ toiletries and goes beyond that. He has the washroom supplied with all the toiletries you likely forgot to bring. There are two cubbies labeled exclusively for the room so that you don’t have to carry your washroom items back and forth. The kitchen is stocked has filtered water and Andy provides an appreciated amount of breakfast/coffee for his guests. There is a helpful craftily curated guide book of the home and its surroundings that Andy created himself along with a cute keepsake map he has at the entry of the home. 

- Bedroom: the room has a large window that allows for it to be filled with bright warm sunshine. The bed is comfortable and the room is spacious. He does mention that you need to put on / take off the bed linens yourself which is why I was not surprised by that when I arrived. 

Overall the home is stylish modern and worth the price. I hope to stay here again the next time I’m in SF!"

A nice retreat from downtown. Lots of interesting eateries and services. 
The king bed was so comfy!
Two of the twins were comfortable but two were not. 
Great communication and friendly help from the hosts."

63247,491813612,2019-07-20,21799048,Chris,Anne’s place is a great location with the heart of the mission district being a short walk away! Checking in and out was very easy and uncomplicated.

21075660,479324100,2019-06-30,25746410,Pamela,"This place was PERFECT. More than enough room. More than enough to feel like home but feel taken care of. The neighborhood is PERFECT. This is not an over exaggeration. The house was exactly what I hoped and wanted it to be for a relaxing girls weekend for my birthday.

We had a number of coffee shops to choose from. I got an easy breakfast for 8 from Progressive. It was easy to get an Uber. The neighborhood was cool but not loud nor busy.

Honestly a 10/10 for me and my girl friends. 

Thank you Elizabeth. And Angela for the prompt replies!"
1125079,257049397,2018-04-24,12623,Michael,Lulu is an amazing host with a beautifully decorated home just a quick hop from SF. I was so busy on my trip that I didn't get much time to hang out with her unfortunately but she was incredibly welcoming and communicative. Check-in was a breeze and the view from this room is incredible! Definitely would stay here again. :)
1651228,567475333,2019-11-22,138013911,Evan,Hosts very kind and respectful of privacy. Provided slippers for wooden floors. We arrived too early for check in and they still let us in.
6107258,140770412,2017-03-31,55724936,Huston,The location is in a decent area. Having a parking space is beneficial.
13796550,567506628,2019-11-22,13223389,Emmet,Lovely apartment with an easy commute into the city or interesting areas like the Mission or Castro. Amanda was a very thoughtful host and super responsive Responding immediately when I managed to lock myself out.
27056649,535973179,2019-09-25,282311492,Haein,"파웰역과는 좀 떨어져있긴하지만 전철과 버스 정류장이 가까이 있어서 크게 불편하진 않았어요. (28번 버스 혹은 M을 타고 왔다 갔다 했습니다)
숙소도 대체로 조용하고 편하게 쉴 수 있었어요"
23025299,366560823,2019-01-02,92817689,María José,Great place really cozy bed and pillows very comfortable! Rachel is a great host very helpful!!
26572144,357602705,2018-12-10,75095971,Whitney,"The Red Victorian (specifically Flower Child) is a bare bone no fluff accommodation in the heart of Haight & Ashbury. It's authentic in that it feels like a victorian San Francisco home. With that know that everything feels a little dim and grungy. When we entered the room there was a terrible odor - so much so that we aired out the space by blasting a fan and propping open the broken window for a few hours. Also know that the bottom mattress is sitting atop a dirty rug on the ground and the top mattress is just below the ceiling with no railing. The beds and sheets itself were very comfortable.

We didn't run into many people during our two nights there but those we did chat to were  friendly and welcoming. I think this place could be fitting for a quick stay to explore the neighborhoods and Golden Gate Park nearby."
66188,286870,2011-05-29,601536,Georg,Great apartment for 6 persons. The panoramic view is awesome! We had a wonderful week! We had not the chance to meet Annette in person but everything was arranged as discussed. Thank you very much! Recommended!
28499025,452729035,2019-05-13,53593587,Marcus,Alles wie auf den Bildern dargestellt. Sehr angenehme Umgebung tolles Haus. Alles was man für eine Aufenthalt braucht. Würde ich jedem weiterempfehlen! Vielen Dank und evtl. bis bald.

3182798,421153793,2019-03-08,140472106,Paul,Edward is a fantastic host and the ship is incredible - the location defies description
11259062,92384913,2016-08-08,4877009,Bruno,"Great experience at the cottage. It's tiny but cosy well equiped and very peacefull.
We didn' t met Marci but we had her on the phone and she was very kind. 
The location is perfect (we recommand Tartine at the 18th street and guerrero) near BART and the subway. 
We recommand the place!!!"
6523507,345661881,2018-11-05,2699373,Jason,This cottage has to be one of the best in San Francisco. Every detail is so cute and stylish. This is an amazing place and great location.
1130628,5773609,2013-07-15,7223231,Erik,Very friendly host. Ashir and Margaret adapted well to my updated arrival time. Room was clean and the bed worked well. Location close to Haight street is great and it's easy to get there with bus 71 from Downtown. 
30469161,410809384,2019-02-10,194795612,Alex,"My stay was very enjoyable. You get to enter through the garage which is super convenient. It was during the winter so being that it's a part of the garage it was cold at first but there are a couple of space heaters available which warm it up quickly. Both the room and the bathroom were clean and the beds were very comfortable. You have access to the backyard and there's coffee available in your room which is a great touch. While the hosts live on the property they respect your space and make themselves available to you for any questions or concerns. 

The only thing I would note is that the home isn't single story so you do hear the footsteps of those walking around upstairs. However I wasn't in the room much so it wasn't really an issue for me."
982298,152870413,2017-05-18,3652343,Aaron,Wonderful location and welcoming surf shack.  Everything was easy and convenient and George made the experience a breeze.
7389541,57555766,2015-12-27,10913440,Chris,Michelle's place was absolutely what we were looking for in San Francisco. It is a five minute walk to the beach and right next to the MUNI train. We stayed with our one year old and Michelle lent us a Pack & Play and even some toys! Parking was super easy as there was always a ton of street parking available. Totally recommend!
31313300,547687891,2019-10-15,230935077,Yufei,Overall it was a great stay. Lauren was very responsive and the place was very clean. Just make sure you understand that this is a ROOM shared with the host not an APARTMENT just be clear and in case people do not pay enough attention.
24361125,315051564,2018-08-27,35580962,Noah,Our family of four found Marjorie’s home comfortable and welcoming. We spend the majority of each day out and about in the city or on day trips and happily came home to this home with a wonderful kitchen and comfortable living space and bedrooms. The beds were very comfortable and cozy. 
11345707,270639227,2018-05-29,30305302,Siwei,"I booked this place for my friend. He loved the place. It's so beautifully designed both the garden and the cottage. The room is sparkling clean and the amenities are 4-star hotel standard very professional.  The location is my favorite area in the city. 
Michael is a superb host. Communication with him is easy and smooth.  He is very friendly and knowledgeable about the city. Highly recommended!"

31124937,441301341,2019-04-21,57579132,Roberta,A clean and basic home stay in San Fran. Make sure you have a car to get into the heart of town. Dongmei is a great host and very helpful.
32216182,485395718,2019-07-10,20185228,Tori,Hareg was a great host and provided the perfect place for our visiting family to enjoy all that Bernal Heights has to offer. We'd be happy to book here again in the future!
8187584,135686602,2017-03-05,64200020,Chris,Ed was very communicative and friendly. Would stay again whenever I'm in the area.
10251,13127144,2014-05-20,8077669,Emma,"Roman and Sarah's apartment was perfect. It is as spacious as the photos suggest and it was incredibly comfortable with everything we needed for our 4 day stay.  You could easily spend a month and feel very at home. The location was great - lots of great restaurants and easy access to many main bus routes. Would consider staying here again if we were lucky enough to be back in San Fran again.

132441,170134738,2017-07-14,124894173,Shain,THIS! PLACE! is AMAZING!  It's unique and perfectly located.  Kurt has perfect communication and easy to reach.  I couldn't stop looking at all of the amazing design and detail in the common areas.

1480015,101709020,2016-09-14,26526321,Volker,Our stay in Ben's apartment  was really fantastic. The beautiful apartment was nicely located in a great neighborhood. Ben was a perfect host and immediately responded to all our questions and needs.  All his recommendations for restaurants and shops were great. We would love to come back. 
6016647,541738680,2019-10-05,203625555,Brandon,Awesome place -- I thought it was just going to be a room in a house but it was more like a whole sub-section of the house complete with kitchen living room access to backyard. Prompt communication and thorough hospitality were top quality.
53280,33452681,2015-05-28,32127233,Innes,Cecilia is a very friendly host she even gave me a call few days before my arrival to make sure the foods and drinks she provides are something I like.  She is very helpful in providing detail information on getting around the city by public transit and there are maps in the room as well.  A very good host I certainly would like to stay at her place if I come visit SF again.
314368,467714287,2019-06-10,119553023,Coby,Fantastic location with a short walk to Pier 39 as well as a number of other local spots. Jason was super lovely and helpful we definitely appreciate the recommendations for local spots to eat. I would happily stay here again.
4663060,564811870,2019-11-16,82029175,Jessica,Marks place was perfect for our stay in San Francisco. The location is beautiful with plenty of cafes just a short walk as well as both bus and tram stops to get you anywhere you want to go. The studio itself was extremely clean and spacious and the bed is super comfortable. Would recommend to anyone!
752607,19768329,2014-09-18,5168816,Michael,"Perfect host perfect accommodation amazing vacation. 
Lily was always there when we needed her and the flat was perfect for me and my family. Also perfectly located to see the real downtown San Francisco. 
I will definitely be coming back."
12310120,90727117,2016-08-02,69748288,Gunilla,We had a great stay in nice quiet surroundings. Bobby and his father were very helpful. It is easy to go downtown by using the Bart just 10 minutes walk from the house. 
177137,522273787,2019-09-01,29998584,Maria,This was a great place to stay! Rick was a super accommodating host and quick to answer all my questions/concerns. The location is pretty great if you’re a tourist in the city since it’s close to great food and entertainment.
60365,9899604,2014-01-18,5984313,Jon,"Great place and great location. Emilie was helpful and responsive. There are a lot of interesting places to eat and drink nearby and it's very easy to catch public transportation.

The bedrooms only have a couple of two-pronged outlets each (very common for San Francisco.) If you need to plug in a laptop or multiple devices you may want to bring a power strip with you. There are many grounded three-prong outlets in the newly updated kitchen and bathrooms."
288213,60327565,2016-01-22,1207243,Rennie,Perfect location with ample parking which is a huge bonus in SF. Katherine & Jared were very responsive and their check-in process was seamless. We loved their cozy flat and it was a block away from all our favorite neighborhood eateries. Wifi was a little hit or miss but otherwise we enjoyed our stay.
8082364,63920589,2016-02-28,54748956,Meredith,Highly recommended! The apartment is in excellent condition and is in a great location.

19403989,199742350,2017-10-02,24125822,Anna,I recommend this place for people who like to explore the entirety of SF!
7437925,66062664,2016-03-19,49645981,Ashley,Carl is a lovely host! The room had everything we needed with clear instructions on how to get in and out of the building. If I am back in SF I will definitely stay again! 
1995487,23014407,2014-11-20,15423989,Richard,Wow what a place. Michael is a wonderful host and his home is beautifully done AND located in a great location. It is comfortable quiet and the rooftop deck provides a ridiculous view of the city. Michael obviously takes his Airbnb responsibilities seriously and goes the extra mile to ensure a memorable stay no matter if you are there for work or pleasure. I will be back!!
3611131,486510163,2019-07-12,260198704,Louisa,Great location to stay if you haven't got a car and if you are in San Francisco for a few days.  The number 5 bus is great for getting to and from downtown - a 10 minute ride and the buses are frequent.  Make sure you have a jacket for the early morning and evenings as the temperature can be a bit cool at those times.  We really enjoyed staying there and there is a great Pizza Place just down the road from the apartment.  Slight noise from neighbours upstairs sometimes  in the evenings but on the whole a quiet neighbourhood.  The apartment is on a slightly steep hill so just bear that in mind but relatively easy to walk up if you do not have mobility issues.  Would recommend staying here.
955071,46420639,2015-09-10,28951497,Raquel Azucena,El anfitrion estuvo correcto en todo monento y nos dio facilidades para la llegada. Pero la habitacion era un poco claustrofobica y la cama no era muy cómoda. 
12026856,436702345,2019-04-13,69831759,Joel,Fantastic place comfortable and really convenient. Great location and the house was really nice. Maria was great and really made our stay easy. Would stay again.
4184406,25774200,2015-01-25,1502797,Tiffany,Brian was a wonderful welcoming host! The neighborhood is one of my favorites in SF - walking distance to Muni the mission castro & lower haight. The bayview room has wonderful light and the entire apt has a wonderful ambiance. 
958,238773143,2018-02-26,2504274,Elyse,Perfect location and a lovely home! Holly and her husband were very kind and accommodating and the place was perfect- great location clean had everything you would need. I’ll be back!

There was a balcony where you could get some fresh air coffee and tea in the room and the mirror had a TV built in (that was just COOL). Dana was a fantastic host in helping make sure I could get coordinated as well. Will DEFINITELY be back!!
126046,4649929,2013-05-18,3764510,Matthias,"The place is absolutely amazing super nice apartment the view over the city is quite nice too.

Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in the city. Great convenient area with stores around. Overall a comfortable and welcoming stay.
23474087,269028831,2018-05-26,72199669,Thomas,Lances place is absolutely wonderful. My girlfriend and I came in late May and were blown away by lances place. It is in a great area with plenty of walkable bars and restaurants in the area as well as a whole foods. The house is only 2 blocks away from a metro stop which takes you right into the heart of downtown in less then 15 minutes. The house itself is beautiful. The living room has a very large TV with netflix and very comfortable chairs for sitting and relaxing. The room is lovely the bed is big and was one of the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in. The temperature in the house can be easily adjusted and cools off and heats up quickly! The bathroom has a beautiful shower and had many samples of shampoo and conditioner in case you forget. If I get back to San Francisco I will go out of my way to stay at Lance’s place because it is so beautiful.
32610962,451424527,2019-05-11,178730616,Daniel,Beautiful space. Very clean. Right in the heart of the Castro and conveniently located near other fun neighborhoods and the BART. Would definitely stay again!
21914,52675080,2015-11-01,25862147,Karanarak,I had a great stay in this apartment Aaron was very helpful and gave me a good overview of the area a great location and price to check out the Carl street and Cole valley and San Francisco. Aaron helped me everything he's very kind and flexible. He comes to apartment everyday for you. Nice comfortable room with four share bathrooms. You can use the kitchen for cooking until 10 pm. The location is the best Muni N line Bus no. 43 6 and 7 were available. Golden Gate Park UCSF Haight street Whole food market Walgreen and many restaurants along Irving street were complete everything for your stay.  I highly recommend. Thank you so much Aaron.
4887475,104466547,2016-09-26,39346904,Manu,We really liked this place. We would definately come back and totally recommend it.
114401,3418906,2013-01-26,4738394,Jason,George was my first airbnb experience.  He accommodated me at the last minute and his apartment was clean comfortable and convenient.  I wholeheartedly recommend...
6423158,106444940,2016-10-06,53797040,Shan,"The house is warm clean and has everything we need. The residential area is safe and beautiful for two girls like us. The location is convenient if you are visiting SF with a car. The twin peaks is just a few minutes away where you can view the entire city at night. The host is responsive and always brings clear instruction ahead of time. I would definitely recommend the house to those who wanna visit SF.

Cheers
Shanshan"
8859249,127221968,2017-01-16,110711976,Kevin,Erika and Gary are great and checked on us for any of our needs. I had a great time visiting locations they recommended and the location was very modern and well decorated. I wouldn't hesitate staying here as you would be in the heart of the town and we got to walk around local restaurants and shops. Erika and Gary also respond quickly even when I myself wasn't always responding right away. Great great home and a great place to stay if you ever visit San Francisco.
13788749,551965295,2019-10-20,87982125,Brianna,Kandle went above and beyond to help me with check-in (I had some flight issues coming in from the East Coast). She helped me get settled and even asked if I needed suggestions. The place was as it looked in pictures. Everything was clean! If you're looking for a simple place to crash while in the Bay Area Kandle's place would be great. It's a quick walk to many restaurants and public transportation stops.
2209751,354419279,2018-12-01,13731961,Julia,Really enjoyed our stay at Jason’s. Great apartment in a great part of san fransisco. Lots of great restaurants bars cafes and shops close by. We’d definitely stay again.
3780418,340688226,2018-10-24,159771594,Shen,"Raveevarn was a lovely host! She designed the house herself; it is quite stylish and modern. The space was very clean and came with a fridge stocked with snacks and drink as well as utensils and cookware for cooking (even a truffle on the pillow which was a nice touch!). As a host she really went above and beyond providing detailed instructions about the area and suggestions for local eats.

This is not her fault but there was construction going on in the building next door during my stay so it was a bit noisy during the day. I stayed only during the week so I am not sure if it continues on the weekends."
3759246,231531754,2018-02-01,57949269,Nikki,Everything was great! The neighborhood is super quiet. The place was a pretty big space for SF. You are close to restaurants stores and Golden Gate Park. It was nice to be able to park my car and walk everywhere I went. David was super easy to communicate with and checked in a few times to make sure I had everything I needed. I would highly recommend this to others and will probably be back myself. 
4269254,80302370,2016-06-17,55181981,Didier,Logement conforme au descriptif c'est à dire parfait rien ne manque...plateau de courtoisie produits d'hygiène fournis même le frigo garni avec quelques boissons pas mal après une longue route! Nombreux mails et conseils utiles des hôtes. Le seul bémol étant la limitation du stationnement à 2 heures en journée  mais c'est un détail! Pour une première expérience airbnb c'est plutôt réussi et je conseille vivement cet endroit.
1206184,288830447,2018-07-10,115624946,Mark,As advertised. Worked out well.
909063,349553079,2018-11-17,5659361,Karen,Rafael and Mark were super welcoming and responsive. I loved staying with them in their space - everything was provided for and super comfortable. Would highly recommend!
713877,219527352,2017-12-17,8441674,Amelia,A truly beautiful and comfortable space! The view was better than expected especially from the bedroom. While cost it comfortably slept 4 and had everything we needed for a weekend trip.
5804060,127251406,2017-01-16,87932834,Alliw,Location was great. Host was nice and accommodating. Ensure you're aware of all costs & any incidentals (as there are not all listed on the site) prior to  reserving the property.
470686,315424953,2018-08-28,27558371,Alan,Exactly as described and Hao was an enthusiastic host and general pleasure to meet.
3549398,17464330,2014-08-12,12656321,Olivia,In a beautiful city like San Francisco finding a place to stay that allows you to navigate to some of the best areas is always a treat! That is exactly what Michael's spot offers! My friend and I were lucky enough to stay for 3 nights and we enjoyed every minute! The location is a quick walk to a major bus line that takes you through the Castro Mission and the Haight! The room was perfect and Michael made everything easy from the type of coffee I like to the type of milk I take WITH my coffee. He was so friendly and helpful that I find it hard to believe I'll want to stay in any other place in the city when I visit! Highly recommended! 
2203283,563707115,2019-11-13,151089070,Steven,Ming is an excellent host.  She greeted me on arrival gave me a city map and suggested places to visit.  The apartment building apparently doesn't have heat (maybe that's common in San Francisco?) and the room was a bit cold (my stay was in November) but Ming gave me plenty of blankets.  Location is good -- quiet block close to Golden Gate Park.  At about $90 a night the price was great for such an expensive city.
1827177,111276189,2016-10-30,38035917,Joshua,"Ashish and Ken were both helpful and gracious hosts. Full of recommendations on great things to do in the area. The room/house/location was great. The bed was super nice and the rainshower in the private bath was exactly what I needed after a long day of walking around San Francisco.

One thing to be aware of is the room is directly off the dining room/kitchen area which serves as the hub of the house. The house is fairly active at times so there's gonna be some noise filtering through. Keep that in mind if you require your room to be an escape/quiet place. On the other hand if you don't like feeling alone or find the presence of homemaking activity comforting this is a perfect fit for you."
3689368,70906276,2016-04-21,24193353,Lynne,He place was okay and in a good location near the city. Brendan waited for us even though we arrived late and personally checked us in and gave us a tour. We had to check out a day earlier due to an emergency but the refund was denied. However Airbnb gave us credit. 
9489347,153796746,2017-05-21,122728965,Timothy,We enjoyed this clean up-to-date nicely decorated space and it was walking distance to coffee shops stores and restaurants. Our hosts were very responsive to questions and needs and upon our arrival we were surprised to see that they had left us a lovely bottle of red wine.  We will stay here again in the future.
25432375,545163455,2019-10-11,72100961,Audrey,Close to public transportation helpful host and hostess and comfortable beds!
837045,483800633,2019-07-07,5506976,Anjali,Jolie was an excellent host. Apartment was very kid friendly and was an awesome location. We would definitely stay there again!! Thanks Jolie
3718865,319568347,2018-09-06,150327141,Abdulmohsen,"Katie was a great host! She was so kind and helpful. The house was clean and nice. She had coffee and tea and the bathroom had shampoos clean towels and everything we needed.
I liked everything about the house. I would definitely recommend it!"
14476185,159804943,2017-06-11,132612142,Christopher,In town for the weekend for a Berkeley wedding. Wanted to stay close to SFO and San Francisco to explore the city. Ideally located in between the two for us and tremendous value. 4 full size beds 1 king and a futon was available. Kitchen 1 private bathroom and 1 shared. Most reasonable price we found and communication was always prompt and very detailed. Towels/linens provided with easy street parking. 
4518031,405868675,2019-01-27,145152135,Vicky,Was amazing! everybody is so nice the location is so convenient bathrooms always clean and I loved the breakfast!
15769324,180235108,2017-08-09,129638250,Priscila,Ótimo custo beneficio ótima localização bem no centro da cidade. Hotel limpo sem barulhos perto de tudo.

16162625,281446252,2018-06-24,154327305,Rachel,Great value! Clean and a perfect location. 
2578122,161368749,2017-06-17,2859551,Fernando,Brian is a great host. His home is just amazing! It's modern and super confortable and you're welcome to use it as your own. Brian is super friendly and he makes sure you're always confortable. I will definitely return on my next visit to SF.  
23567834,266913107,2018-05-20,24480973,Julia,Perfect locations and outstanding hospitality
6074750,313651666,2018-08-25,35234022,Megan,Great location to everything we wanted to do! 
12115392,164829729,2017-06-29,3186519,Emily,For location this can't be beat and it has operable windows! Many hotels don't have that so it's nice to get a little breeze now and again. It's right around the corner from TARTINE (oh my god tartine) and bi-rite market. Oh and Dolores Park. Great location. You are sharing an apartment (and bathroom) with the host so maybe not the best for a romantic vacay but it was just my friend and I so it was more than enough for us. No frills to the experience really but great value real bed fantastic location and great communication by the host (on time communicate policies well etc.) 
4957143,92911046,2016-08-10,53166793,Gina,We had a wonderful stay with Beth and Tom. Their apartment is beautiful clean and perfectly located to get around the city. Loads of cool places to check out within walking distance. We were on our honeymoon and even had a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us on arrival little touches like this really made our visit special. They also have a really handy guide book with loads of recommendations on places to eat drink socialise etc. It was a great help. Recommend highly to anyone! 
4902907,140560473,2017-03-30,3797675,Joshua,The place is nice and as advertised. Comfortable bed. Good communication.
14505006,294165759,2018-07-21,105858999,Jennifer,This property is amazing!  The house was clean and very modern. The location is perfect and the view is more spectacular in person than in the photos. It was a quite location with no street noise. There was no parking so we turned in our rental car and used public transportation for our time in SF.  I highly recommend this because parking is expensive in the city.  The house had a washer and dryer and a small fridge.  If you are looking to stay in San Francisco book this airbnb location you will not regret it. 
17767863,463717491,2019-06-03,26128119,Megan,Had a great stay! Felt at centre of San Fran! Great start to America trip!!
10989099,193246960,2017-09-12,5547613,Carlos,A perfect place to stay if you have business with UCSF. This place is quite safe and clean. Parking maybe hard to find but I was lucky to get one right away. A walkable distance to many restaurants. Mickey is nice enough to to provide her visitors a map of current location of her apt within the neighborhood to facilitate a quick direction. Very smart! This place is highly recommended.
2160504,136615745,2017-03-11,41722764,Michelle,"Will definitely deserves the title Superhost! I arrived from Germany late in the evening and he picked me up at the airport without charging me for anything. At his home he had prepared snacks and drinks for free. The room (2 rooms actually) was 100% beautiful clean and cozy (and huuuuuuge). He and Carlos are very polite and respectful. I was able to ask him for anything I needed and he responded within 5 mins. I worked all day long while I stayed with him and he gave me my privacy. It is possible to watch tv in several languages including Spanish and English. In regards to public transit: I only used Uber (10$-20$ per day aprox.) because I did not want to spend time walking to the Bart station. Will gave me more time to check out and drove me to my new apartment (I'm moving to SF) again without charging. I had a very convenient stay!!! Thank you I'm definitely recommending the place.
"
9196933,486522895,2019-07-12,129141861,Norbert,Deborah and Jim are great hosts! We visited San Francisco for the second time and enjoyed the quiet and good location especially the garden is very beautiful - a oasis in the city. We would visit it again :-)
1633933,237902341,2018-02-24,35817194,Henry,I could talk about the great location of Jean-Michel's place or the clean and tidy room or private bathroom or relaxing and spacious living area but as with all great airbnb's it's the Host that makes the ultimate difference: Jean-Michel's just a great guy! Had an awesome stay and will be in touch again soon.
27938375,444297684,2019-04-27,191608715,Iyin,Valentino's place has a lot of charm and as I came to find out it's one of the last remaining houses built in 1910! The room was very clean the sheets bedding and pillows were very comfortable. The shared bathroom is quite small I wouldn't recommend if you're a bigger/taller person. And the floors are a bit creaky from the original wood but overall I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Valentino was a gracious host with a genuine passion for his city and I got a great last minute tour before I left!
2592518,265594540,2018-05-17,128711380,Aniket,This small apartment easily fits 5-6 people without any problems. The place is extremely modern and clean. We walked around the city from the apartment and it took about 30 minutes to an hour to get just about anywhere on foot. You could alternatively take a $10-12 uber/lyft. Daniel was extremely helpful accessible and had great suggestions for things to do around SoMa and the city.
238190,187272475,2017-08-26,1958590,Sam&Freya,A good base for walking around the city
13220623,278279809,2018-06-17,175824360,Ben,Exceptional with everything. Great location to get into town and cool stuff nearby as well. 
1945508,410160039,2019-02-09,12053865,Joanna,Best airbnb experience we have had. Julie and her place are absolutely fabulous. An exquisitely decorated warm well-lit gorgeous space. I booked the room for my aging mother who was visiting me from out of town for a few days. Julie went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of - she communicated with me regularly and added beautiful extra touches: Fresh flowers! Snacks in the room! An array of breakfast food and drinks! Why would anyone ever book a hotel when you can receive unique and artful hospitality like this? Thank you for a very memorable stay.
29877418,436307980,2019-04-12,113397543,Jackie,This house is beautiful! It is located in a great area for restaurants and is a close walk to many of the beautiful sights San Francisco has to offer. Helen was extremely responsive and provided all that we would need.
6793767,45187178,2015-08-31,21190172,Jennifer,We had such a lovely experience at Janet's beautiful studio apartment. The apartment was so clean and had all the amenities needed. We loved the view of downtown from the picture window and enjoyed planning our next day's adventure while looking at the city lights at night. Janet was a great host and was very accommodating. We had a great time and hope to go back soon!
2074584,22559553,2014-11-09,3360708,Kevin,The place was very sweet and the hosts very responsive and accommodating.  The location is great as well.  Two things to understand though.  First the entrance is off of an alley.  There were homeless people hanging around the door every day at all hours and more than a couple late night/early morning 'scream fests'.  Second the main house is under construction.  So if you plan on going for relaxation or want to sleep in past 8am it's not going to happen.  The saws and workers are right outside your door in the small courtyard.  You may want to check on progress before you book.  
18999934,172734315,2017-07-21,82122521,Chelsea,Paul's place was amazing! Everything was clearly labeled and check in was a breeze. There were ample amenities. In addition the view was amazing from our room and the front yard.
4052091,526416660,2019-09-08,13589499,Prudence,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The home was of a high standard in a lovely area that was easy to get to all things we wanted to do. Transport system good.  Beth was very helpful with suggestions of things to do and we did most of them and enjoyed them all.
6437010,33724272,2015-05-31,33224355,Nspyre,Joanne made us feel welcome and provides us with just enough company and space.

221342,185052524,2017-08-20,143428070,Robin,Love  The views and the location to North Beach and the best Italian food ever !
19644702,265626855,2018-05-17,68534282,Ankita,Nate and Chad's apartment is centrally located and very convenient to all the tourist spots in SF. The apartment is very clean and the sofa-bed is super comfy. Nate is very quick with his responses and a wonderful host. I would definitely recommend his place to anyone who is visiting SF and given a choice visit again :)
3183280,105988122,2016-10-03,24465099,Randy,Aruna makes life easy simple instructions to get you everything you need.   Her place is beautiful right in the heart of San Fran. 
585326,54456536,2015-11-20,7022346,Don,The room was a great place to stay and the private access was easy. Having a private bathroom is always a great feature.
4387067,197997252,2017-09-27,26078975,Michelle,"Great location with a metered parking lot next to the house gas stations on two corners and grocery store with Starbucks across the street. Plus plenty of restaurants and shops for every need steps away. With 3 rooms available this location would make a great option for travel with friends or family or a space to put up out of town guests. 

The room and bathroom are tastefully designed bright clean and spacious. There is also a huge closet. I felt safe in this part of town and very comfortable in my room. 

Another plus is the art collection. Amazing originals and prints for guests to enjoy."
78651,200837536,2017-10-06,79909980,Rafael,Good place. Close to the Bart station what maked easy for me to reach every place I needed. Good communication with the hosts.
31120211,416637560,2019-02-24,12162602,Richard,Great place to stay while visiting San Francisco in the Sunset area. Many interesting restaurants and cafeterias in the area and well connected through Muni to other parts of the city.

2134475,226277122,2018-01-09,122203473,Bruno He,La casa está a pasos de la bahía muy cómoda y cálida. Los host son muy amables atentos y te sirven el desayuno con facturas recién hechas. Recomendaría a cualquier personal que visite San Francisco que se alojen en la casa de Sandor.
14936250,531524768,2019-09-17,118992321,Amanda,"This is a perfect home base for exploring San Francisco. My friend and I stayed comfortably for 4 days with a good amount of space and plenty room for our stuff. Plenty towels provided (8 bath towels plus several wash cloths - I tend not to excessively reuse towels so appreciated this :). Everything really clean Great shower pressure and plenty hot water. Adorable patio area. 

This was so reasonably priced compared to hotels which were outrageous the weekend we were in town. And location was perfect. 10 min walk to BART station and some restaurants and coffee shops. We also used Uber a lot and found this to be a great base for exploring the city. 

Katherine and Rory were both so nice and friendly. They gave us our space but were very responsive including letting us borrow an iron and Katherine left us some sweet treats after we had a really minor maintenance issue that was taken seriously and resolved quickly :) 

Coffee/tea shampoo and conditioner and bottled waters were all included for our use. Space very private with its own entrance and in a cute/safe neighborhood that felt totally safe for ladies traveling alone - even walking bask at night. You really can’t go wrong booking this for the price and proximity to SF sightseeing."
30776488,495285918,2019-07-25,43407117,Max,The Red Vic is an amazing space at an amazing location. If you want to experience a genuine part of SF this is the place to be.

1017799,299803264,2018-07-31,45886922,Laura,Kameh's place is in a great neighborhood. Buses run a block away from her house and there are plenty of places to eat. 
2956406,47607367,2015-09-21,26479454,Diane,We had a fabulous time in San Fransisco. Simon was the perfect host - we had everything we wanted.

1333047,180989865,2017-08-11,129644245,Victoria,My mother grandmother and I went to San Francisco for a girls getaway and stayed at Graham's place. We loved the house and the neighborhood. It was secluded and very spacious. Graham was a great host and was happy to help with suggestions and questions. Our only complaint is that we couldn't take Graham's sweet cats Kurya and Rorbu home with us!
23551287,359725396,2018-12-17,224245878,Saúl,Great location

The recommendatons for food and places to go in the area were spot on.  The neighborhood was amazing and we really liked it by the water.  I would go again in a heart beat. 
4527553,38481577,2015-07-16,29170141,Kendall,We adored our time at Yaella's beautiful apartment. Great location a 5 minute walk from the metro and a really beautiful space with an amazing kitchen and perfect back deck. Yaella was an incredible hostess and easy to coordinate with. Our favorite Airbnb!
786506,187863146,2017-08-27,68855674,Rebecka,This was my first stay at a hostel and I had such a great time. The staff is friendly and welcoming and always there to help. Since it's pretty small it's easy to make friends and there's daily activities going on. I would definitely go back to stay here it made my stay in San Francisco the best vacation ever!
19478755,322313583,2018-09-12,206232673,Shir,kate is a great host. she is available and will help you organize your vacation. also she serve a nice and tiny breakfast which she trying to variety every day. the location is good and the room is comfortable.

As everybody else has said he is very available for communication if necessary. The location is convenient parking is easy and the kitchen is well stocked in case you want to cook. The apartment has a warm comfortable feeling to it and the little details that Rahul added made us feel very welcome. 
28200634,430077222,2019-03-29,193234756,Cousin,We loved our stay at Edmund’s apartment.  It was perfectly located  for our suburbanite family to feel like big city dwellers and also a quick drive to all of the major San Francisco tourist spots.   Easy walkability and very quiet and safe feeling neighborhood.   Definitely would stay again.
4365969,157398663,2017-06-03,95231564,Pascal,"Perfekt für jeden der San Francisco erkunden möchte!

Leslie ist eine so unglaublich freundliche Person mit jeder Menge guter Tips rund um San Francisco und darüber hinaus. Es wurde sogar etwas zum frühstücken in den Kühlschrank gelegt damit man direkt gut gestärkt in den Tag starten kann. 

Die Lage ist sehr Zentral. Man braucht nur 5 min zu Fuß um mit der U-Bahn (BART) über 3 Stationen direkt in die Stadt zu fahren. Ein großer Vorteil ist auch dass man dadurch die Parkgebühren gespart hat da man direkt vor der Türe parken kann. 1 mal am Tag muss das Auto jedoch umgestellt werden da das Parken von 09:00 bis 17:00 Uhr nur für 4 Stunden erlaubt ist. Aber selbst das umparken übernimmt Leslie wenn man selber nicht da ist. 

Die Unterkunft ist exakt wie auf den Bildern zu sehen. Alles ist sehr sauber und man hat sein eigenes kleines Reich. 

Von uns gibt es eine ganz klare Weiterempfehlung! 

Vielen Dank Leslie...

The pictures accurately reflect the condo so everything was just as I hoped. High end furnishings comfy leather sectional 65"" LED TV gas range sub-zero fridge and excellent memory foam mattress. The condo complex is quiet and friendly with nice amenities.

The location is super convenient close to two grocery stores public transit and the freeway. SoMa is a great neighbourhood with lots of restaurants pubs and the AT&T park all a short walk away.

I stayed for 4 months and walked to the Financial District every day it's a great place and would definitely return."

10282326,181906490,2017-08-13,11224938,Michelle,Very nice suite with a very comfortable king bed. 2 bathrooms for the comfort of all. Nothing is missing. Everything is perfect. The location is ideal. Close to everything. The cable car is right next door as well as all the bus lines. A great place to stay.
351881,16021607,2014-07-20,16844119,Marnelli Joy,"Chris and Katie were wonderful! They were very accommodating with our check in and check out times. Communication was also very easy leading up to our check in.
The first morning we were there Chris had made coffee and we were able to get to know each other a little bit.
My fiance and I loved the neighborhood and being able to walk to different restaurants and stores. It is close to bus stops and the MUNI station which made getting around easy. We also liked being in the not-so-touristy places.
The home was exactly like the photos and we loved all the books!"

20957480,411571983,2019-02-13,205560344,Mika,"I have used my Air BnB plenty of times to allow my company to pay for an employee without the employee obtaining credit card info. Most people are accepting of it i had one tell me he wouldn't and asked me to cancel (perfectly fine!) 

When booking this place I clearly stated that this was for an employee not myself and they accepted my booking with a thanks. Employee shows up it wasn't me so they kicked him out. They didn't call me I had to hear this from Air BnB support who felt absolutely terrible after I sent screenshot of message clearly stating it wasn't going to be me. 

My employee ended up sleeping in his car because it was fairly late and the next day tells me he was kind of happy because it was odd and smelt kind of like cat pee. I don't think I've ever been more embarrassed in my life. They did give a full refund which is great but as far as the experience goes... how can you be so uncaring? 

As far as amenities go I cannot attest for that because my employee wasn't there long enough to do so.  

Maybe this is a really great place to stay maybe it's not.. but I am really unhappy with the experience."

Sehr nette junge Familie. Gute Infrastruktur Nespresso Kaffeemaschine! Reichhaltiges Frühstück steht zur Verfügung.
Sehr gutes Doppelbett."
2203283,56677396,2015-12-16,34704256,Michelle,Experienced and prompt host who worked with me on my arrival when I wanted to show up later than I  had told her. Gave a good orientation of San Fran before I headed out for the first time. 
26928489,307138299,2018-08-13,28870900,Patrick,"Outstanding service. As good as it gets. What you hope for if you are an AirBNB guest. A beautiful space in a quiet neighborhood. Walking distance from plenty of local delights and Golden Gate Park.

Greg and Molly are tremendous hosts. Great communication and the local beers in the refrigerator was a nice touch. Will be back for sure if I’m back in Outer Sunset. "
8336042,280235544,2018-06-22,47455298,Daz,"Beautifully appointed studio with thoughtful touches - Netflix enabled telly a Harman Kardon Aura Studio Bluetooth speaker. The bathroom was also a highlight for me. New huge and well appointed. Matt obviously has fantastic taste.

Location was also great. It’s just off a major road near Bernal Heights but very quiet. It usually takes me between 1-2 mins to grab and Uber."
12522,10041431,2014-01-27,3196204,Carla,Seriously-- such a fabulous experience. Amazing location and the room was great. Brenda was a warm and charming hostess along with the fun Boo! Definitely recommended.
5572169,271593378,2018-06-01,85713180,Eileen,We loved our stay in this beautiful home!  It was absolutely perfect! Highly recommend staying here!
18737830,415847525,2019-02-23,128394531,Chia,A cozy clean and quiet stay.
13815533,129579470,2017-01-31,4930846,Valeria,"Pros: Location it's super close to the beach. Place is clean nice bathroom towels. Kitchen has everything you need except microwave. 4 small bottles of water were left at my door after my arrival. Place smelled good when I walked in.

Cons: The biggest issue we had was the noise upstairs. We could hear everything that was going on there. Host had a late night dinner on Saturday night and we had to contact them first via text with no response then via Airbnb and they only gave us an explanation of why they were making noise. No apologies whatsoever. Host requires guests to be quiet because host can hear everything from upstairs. Guest be aware that you will hear every step and conversation and slammed doors from upstairs.
Bathroom didn't have a trash can. Kitchen trash cans didn't have plastic bags (only clumsy paper ones that I replaced with some plastic bags I purchased at Safeway).

Overall this place is okay. If you don't mind late night noise go for it! If you do I suggest renting another place."
10528294,325118798,2018-09-18,12628304,Howard,We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay at Adrienne and Paulo's lovely apartment. It was airy comfortable and spacious and only steps away from the myriad attractions of the Mission District. Adrienne was away at the time of our stay but Paulo was a gracious host allowing us an early check-in when our flight schedule changed and offering suggestions for nearby restaurants (Tacolicious and Le Marais were two of our favourites). We will be back!
10889831,70973382,2016-04-22,51227169,Gabriele,Danna is a very nice and very polite women. She helped us to find any solution. She was very nice to pick up us directely in airport and when I was in trouble to exchange some cash she borrowed the cash in advance. The house is traditional clean and in one of the better areas of San Francisco.
21729398,334680496,2018-10-09,192935972,Zack,"Couldn't have asked for a better stay! Walking distance from all the best parks and only a short busride from the city. The neighborhood was very good aswell I always felt comfortable walking around the area. 

The room was cozy and cleanly. 

The host also very kind constantly offering water and reminding us of all the amenities we were welcome to use."
8351923,201081799,2017-10-07,111433514,Evalyn,"A hidden gem. Very private with private patio.
We called Michelle with some questions and she returned our calls quickly!
Small compact but has all the amenities!"
5144482,239440438,2018-03-01,13074962,Kristen,Finding the parking and location was very easy thanks to Michelle’s information. Getting in was effortless everything is lovely and clean and we were so grateful for the goodie basket especially the wine which was very welcome after our long drive. Everything is perfect! I recommend Michelle and the space.
17301015,243667663,2018-03-16,155195885,Chen Chen,The beds are too noisy and a little too soft.
770991,53752643,2015-11-12,6396904,Yinan,Rose was so warm and friendly. She gave us useful tips about visiting the city and left us with some breakfast items to start the day. The apartment was clean and homey. We loved the neighborhood.  It felt very safe and the MUNI station is less than 5 minutes away for heading downtown. There are a number of restaurants (Chinese Thai Japanese Italian) in the area and a great homemade ice-cream shop nearby. Would definitely stay there again if we return to SF!
2455313,16825673,2014-08-03,13196458,Matthew,"Jaysa's house was perfect for my small family and mother.  We have a 6 month old baby and a hotel room was not going to work for us.  Jaysa's house supplied us with a beautiful crib and private sleep quarters for our little guy.  He was able to enjoy this beautiful home as much as we did.
Everyone in my party loved the home location (especially the Mexican restaurants and coffee shops) and hospitality that Jaysa provided.  This was my first Airbnb stay and I give it 5 stars!  We'd love to stay at Jaysa's home again if we're back in the San Francisco area.  Thank you!

The pictures on Airbnb match the house perfectly.  "
7968749,520588532,2019-08-30,287213206,Cassie,"This place is an absolute dream. The decor was very tasteful and the apartment itself very spacious. Location is absolutely ideal for anyone wanting to be in a nice quiet neighborhood but still with easy access to the city's amenities. The true gem of this place are the views. From the kitchen living room master bedroom and rooftop deck you can see Alcatraz Golden Gate Bridge (fog willing!) and the entire downtown area. 

The owner is extremely responsive and flexible. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
4948340,205010238,2017-10-20,21850657,Kyle,Nice comfortable private room. Just what I needed. Great hospitality

2011311,77116364,2016-05-30,22137745,Jeffrey,We really enjoyed staying at Elliott's apartment! The decor of her house was really well designed and cool! Elliott was always helpful and available when we needed help. Everything was clean and tidy. We didn't realize how good the location of this house was until the next morning when we woke up to the carnival going on in the neighborhood. Just behind was the beautiful Balmy St Mural too. It was close to the BART station and provided a safe and quiet oasis after a long day of exploring SF. Thanks for a lovely and memorable stay! Definitely recommend staying here.  
26747021,456896345,2019-05-22,37021510,Leon,Great space for an individual friends or a couple to explore San Francisco. Location is great - close to Mission and the Castro and Noe Valley is full of great restaurants cafes bars and cool shops. The place was very clean and the use of a door code makes check-in and out super easy (no waiting around for the host or embarrassment if your flight is delayed..). Michael is a great and attentive host and was a big help. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great. There is also a washing machine/dryer round the back which is really helpful. Overall - highly recommend.
845501,39366815,2015-07-23,25949131,Jp,Nous avons rester 4 nuits. Prendre note que la maison est situé à 50-60 minutes du centre-ville de SF donc à considérer. L'endroits est bien et partager avec 2 autres chambres en location. La salle de bain est plutôt petite mais correct. Delores est très gentille et accueillante. Tout s'est bien déroulé.
7618503,52985781,2015-11-03,27546502,Ksenia,Rachel's apt is exactly as in the photos modern clean comfy and with all the necessary items for stay.  We loved the roof with a breathtaking view on the city. The neighbourhood is really nice and feels safe. Restaurants grocery shops stores are all really close and a parking spot is easy to find. Even if we didn't have a chance to meet Rachel in person the communication went really well. She was very quick responding on my mails and available for questions. The check-in and check-out went really smooth. I definitely recommend this apt! 
26713704,525375061,2019-09-07,5300434,David,Very crisp and nicely decorated place! Good facilities/amenities and more than one bedroom. Although no door between the two rooms it was still very convenient for our little family (2 small children).
7478631,164763907,2017-06-29,5521663,Lisa,Kay's place is very cute and we loved the neighborhood. We greatly appreciated Kay's attention to detail to make our stay comfortable the nice furnishings and decor and the easy entrance and exit. Absolutely no complaints! Our stay at Kay's was such a comfortable and relaxing treat after 10 days of camping in the nearby national parks :) We hope to go back one day.

Eine sehr schöne Unterkunft in ruhiger Lage wirklich empfehlenswert!
1029621,184015954,2017-08-18,6918141,Animesh,We would stay here again. A beautifully maintained apartment. Centrally located near public transport and vibrant neighborhoods. The hosts were so friendly flexible responsive. We felt like we were staying with friends.
5572169,84529209,2016-07-07,59063768,Jeri,Alison was very attentive to us upon our arrival and was such a gracious host. The room was in immaculate condition with a heavenly bed. The balcony was a dream come true as well. A plethora of fantastic restaurants are within little walking distance. We highly recommend staying with Allison! 
6120540,363955367,2018-12-29,119991827,Kristen,We booked our room last minute. Philip responded very fast and made the check in process easy! Everything was clean and they were very hospitable.

7949668,142541419,2017-04-08,27915378,Olivia,Rania's home is beautiful and clean and she was a gracious host. We appreciated the self check in instructions and the location near family we were visiting. We were surprised that another room across the hall was also rented and that the bathroom was shared if another guest was present as we wanted more privacy. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend Rania's place if you are open to sharing some space with other guests. 
4993804,86854568,2016-07-17,56316044,Tracey,We had such a great time in San Francisco this weekend. This house is just incredible. The pictures of the house are great online and the house is even better in person! Greg was very responsive and helpful from check in to check out! He is truly blessed to have such a beautiful place in San Francisco! Thank you for allowing us to make these memories!
5173043,87768990,2016-07-21,27424512,Allison,We had a great experience here. The room was big and clean. Great location. We made use of the small gym. We would definitely stay here again. Great value for the area!!
4510968,34972046,2015-06-14,4765086,Maxim,"The apartment is very nice and cozy very comfortable bed well equipped and very convenient kitchen. Wooden table and nice sofa in living room are worth to mention as well. Listing photos are accurate.

This apartment is situated on first floor of vintage house has separate entrance. On the second floor there is another apartment. The door is being locked by 4-digit code (learn how to use it carefully it might seem tricky at first sight) so no keys are needed the apartment is secured by ADT company (very common in that area).

Location of this apartment is just amazing. Glen Park is a great residential area full of green trees and colorful flowers several bars and restaurants are in walking distance if you need them BART station just few blocks away. There is a very good supermarket in walking distance from the apartment full of organic fruits vegetables and other cool stuff - very vegetarian/vegan friendly place nicely decorated.

But the most beautiful thing is that there is a big Glen Canyon Park nearby where you can feel yourself just as in a wild forest it's amazing place to walk around and enjoy nature it's really worth to visit.

Very quiet place especially at night.

We were there in early June but it was quite cool in the apartment the heater is being controlled from the apartment upstairs but even when it was working it was pretty much chilly in the apartment especially at night.

All in all it was great experience to stay here it's especially enjoyable place for calmness and nature lovers (as me and my girlfriend are). Highly recommend to everyone."

Thank you for everything Deborah.

16018565,230035437,2018-01-26,6138151,Michael,Conveniently located close to Union Square and public transportation Charles's place was such a great stay for my colleague and I while in town for work. Cozy rooms with heat and plenty of blankets for the chilly SF winter nights. All-around great stay and would definitely come back for the convenient location close to some SF staples like Liholiho Yacht Club and Mr. Holmes Bakehouse!
900393,10585756,2014-02-26,10347450,Laurence,"Appartement tres sympathique. Bien situé.Possibilité de garer sa voiture dans la rue gratuitement et sans soucis. Cèpendant deux problèmes ont un peu gâché notre séjour.en effetl'appartement est au rez de chaussée et le voisin du dessus est tres tres bruyant. Lever le matin tres tot et faisant beaucoup de bruit( appartement mal insonorisé) et coucher tard le soir avec bruit de perceuse et autre bricolage!!!! Dommage.
Un autre point a signaler.nous étions quatre et l'eau chaude est vraiment juste le matin pour se laver a 4."
394575,218949187,2017-12-15,22265198,Joel,Good eats in easy walking distance.  Very interesting and thoughtful space.  Quiet at night.  LYFT ride shares came quickly to this corner just a few short blocks from the top of one of SF’s many hills where you can walk quietly and have great views.
15860884,437590046,2019-04-14,89551475,Benjamin,Prime location. Perfect for what I needed. Jeff was very quick with communication. Would recommend
13127954,250343649,2018-04-04,37725557,Andrea,"Great place to stay with an awesome view from the hill. Sunsets are the best!
You can easily walk down to Mission in a bunch of minutes and Pankaj was next door always happy to provide great suggestions.
The Moroccan room was just perfect clean nicely decorated and definitely quiet. If you drive the free parking in front is a great value.
Definetely recommend it!"

The location is central and convenient as well. I really couldn’t recommend it enough!!"
14553693,429038566,2019-03-26,30871679,Mark,I highly recommend staying at this wonderful cottage! Rosa and Syd could not have been more gracious hosts. They made staying in a great city more special
6360976,59223217,2016-01-08,50694122,Byoung-Hyoun,"Pros: great location (only two blocks from the Lombard St) responsive host (lives in the back unit and can be reached easily) the view from the master bedroom is quite nice. 

Cons: the unit and its appliances are overall dated and did not seem to be maintained thoroughly (e.g. the window in the full bath was broken and would not close all the way letting cold air in) the main heating cannot be controlled (however the owner provides portable heaters) very thin walls so you can hear the neighbor walking around in his unit"
1421774,450555154,2019-05-09,142409937,Katie,Such a neat place to stay! Close to everything from food to parks and they were very helpful with tips and recommendations. Space was just perfect for my husband and I and if ever back in San Fran will definitely be choosing them!
3257979,98752408,2016-09-01,48987397,Pat,Robert was a fantastic host during my short stay! He included a short tour of the area upon my arrival consisting of local transit options restaurants and grocery stores which was definitely helpful. The room was nice and spacious and the house was located less than a block away from a bus line taking you right into downtown.
11191951,219500704,2017-12-17,1986734,Mike,Fantastic location at the top of the hill and though the daily climb may not be for everyone (including 219 steps and steep roads) we enjoyed it and the views over the city are magnificent - especially from the bathroom window. The room is compact with limited closet and storage space though it has a fridge microwave and coffee machine and lots of extra details like phone charger good wifi snacks in the fridge and lots of useful local information. The bed is especially comfortable. Jeff and Matt checked in with us regularly and even garaged our car so we avoided the local parking restrictions. The accommodation is walking distance to the famous Castro and Haight Street. The room also has direct access to an outside terrace with views over the road towards San Francisco Bay.

31210673,505710299,2019-08-09,79542097,Giorgio,Laura's basement apartment is close to public transport connections to the city center (it takes around 30 minutes) and it is an economic solution for visiting San Francisco. The apartment was pretty well cleaned however I noticed that the towels were more grey than white with dark stains. Furthermore even if Laura wrote me to feel free to eat anything I found in the kitchen some items were expired from more than a month there were two frozen bananas and two moldy lemons. I had to throw everything in the trash. Communications with the host were good self check-in and check-out
4287481,42824506,2015-08-16,29305692,Claudia,"We've had a warm welcome at the apartment. The family is very friendly and willingly to give you all the information you need. There was fruit chips water and other things to make us feel welcome.
The apartment has a nice garden and is nearby the Muni to downtown. It's very close by the Golden Gate Parc. In the neighbourhood are a lot of Chinese shops and restaurants."

The room is thoughtfully decorated with all the comforts you’d appreciate. The bathroom is also clean and spotless. Koncha was very communicative and left clear directions. Highly recommend.

8340498,427036295,2019-03-22,61597151,Antonio,This is the second time I stayed at Jacob's place. His place is amazing and so he is.
1944564,11584138,2014-04-08,11011769,Mark,Cool place to stay! Lots of character. It's more like living in SF than visiting. We enjoyed it.

3780418,72443919,2016-05-02,9615797,Etienne,We had a wonderful stay with Raveevarn. The apartment is clean efficient and conveniently located. The style of the modern apartment is very pleasing. The bed is very comfortable.
4663060,61080787,2016-01-31,49186890,Jessica,We had a great experience staying at Mark's place. He made it easy to check-in and out and was communicative from the start. The neighborhood is safe with lots to walk to and the house sits on a hill with an amazing view. The place is furnished with just the basics which worked for us.
10632584,171472689,2017-07-17,14467972,Mary,Loved the place and the neighborhood. 
21790140,245306376,2018-03-21,113379705,Katie,"Really enjoyed staying here! The perfect place when you're in town for a conference.

The room itself could be cramped if there were two people stay there but it can be doable."
17408793,309152448,2018-08-17,107069411,Renee,The place is very clean with thought full amenities like shampoo and conditioner coffee and tea and bottled water. There are two lovely bedrooms with comfortable beds and bedding as well as extra blankets in case it's cold. Peter and Ni are very responsive and helpful.  Although there aren't any stores or restaurants on the actual street the place is very close to the N. Judah streetcar that runs downtown often. Also there is a supermarket on Noriega and 30th. I highly recommend this place.
20654216,201674759,2017-10-08,52090104,Susanna,John’s place was excellent! Great location in the mission steps from Dolores Park large bedroom with a fridge and clean facilities.  John was very communicative and helpful. Thanks for a great stay!
14266916,567867206,2019-11-23,56838992,Aneta,Absolutely fantastic stay! Marie & Laurent's place is like walking into your second home so beautifully decorated very spacious and has everything you may need - kitchen fully equipped washing machine and drier the patio is beautiful for morning coffee. Check-in with the door code lock is very convenient.
1454220,95779895,2016-08-20,4173654,Sebastian,The description and photos are perfectly qccurate. Jon's apartment is spacious and modern the attention to detail and care for the furnishing is impressive and creates a really nice and sofisticated experience that is high abive the expectations of the neighborhood. The apartment features paid weekly housekeeping which enabled us to enjoy the space without any preocupation. A real 5-star experience.
8793569,163964459,2017-06-25,122549522,Cesar,James' place is perfect. This is an ideal accommodation for a solo traveler or a couple. The room is located in a very safe neighborhood with quick access to my one of my favorite streets in San Francisco Valencia St. The location is hard to beat. It's just a mere two blocks to Mission Dolores Park and a short distance to bunch of great restaurants and nightlife. I would definitely use again!
786506,563711651,2019-11-13,169749779,Matthew,"This establishment is rated as 5 stars on the AIR BNB site but I would not rate it as such. Guests need to be aware that there is no genuinely free parking anywhere. There is a parking garage across the street with in & out privileges but the gate closes at 9pm --- after 9pm guests will not be able to park their cars in nor take their cars out but at least their cars will be safe. The will inform guests of parking garages one block away but not the one across the street --- the ones a block are guaranteed to be safe. But guests are told of the risks. 

There is some free parking on the street but only till 7pm. Even though l was parked free of charge on the street l and another guest still received a $79 parking ticket for parking there during the three days a week when they are street cleaning (between 2-6am). If u park on the street find a parking meter which is colored grey on top. The grey ones give u 2 hours of paid parking.

Bring a pad-lock. Their bunk-beds have a locker arrangement which can be secured by pad-locks.

YOU WILL NOT BE GIVEN A REFUND OF YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU CANCEL 48 HOURS IN ADVANCE -- I CHECKED OUT EARLY BUT WAS REFUSED A REFUND (A HOTEL WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS).

Otherwise this establishment is very close to its description on the net. You'll pretty much get what you need here -- you just have to go in prepared."
2486953,106883157,2016-10-08,33299531,David,"Vincent has paid great attention to detail furnishing the space including high-end snacks and sparkling water shopping bags umbrellas and just about anything you might need in a bathroom. 
I highly recommend this place; the only drawback for some people might be that a fair amount of uphill walking is required but for those not interested in walking there is a MUNI stop around the corner. "
4106442,21387984,2014-10-16,4365782,André,I had a very good time at the apartement. Samantha was a super friendly host the apartment is in a good area with lots of restaurants and close to a BART station. I felt like a local while living there. Being a tech-person I especially liked the high speed internet access which actually works unlike in many hotels in San Francisco. Finally I found the complimentary beer and wine a nice touch.
3850,13229775,2014-05-22,8996947,Yu,The room is clean cozy and the price is good. Kevin is such a nice guy who always wants to help. If you are looking for a room in SF Kevin's place is highly recommended. 
3123536,323510621,2018-09-15,117782369,Philip,"Sorry for this long winded review that may seem overly effusive with praise. But it is completely sincere and true.

My work as scientist takes me all over the planet and I have had many great experiences  staying in Airbnbs. But I place my stay at Lanalee's place at the top of this long list. The location is great in a fun neighborhood Bernal Heights which is convenient to downtown SF the Mission and most places in SF where you want to be. I needed to have a car for this trip and the house has a very nice off street parking space. The house is situated on the edge of a hill (no big surprise in SF) with beautiful light and space and views from inside the house as well as from the tranquil and beautiful deck and garden right outside the kitchen. The house is perfectly clean!!! Spotless!!! The two bedrooms are really great with comfy beds the one bathroom was perfectly fine but not huge the kitchen is large really nicely appointed and was  very generously and thoughtfully stocked with useful and appreciated food items and coffee.  I loved the home's aesthetics/art/books/decor that while not my home made me feel like I was in a home that I would love to live in. And to complete my stellar review Lanalee's property is managed by her friend Jill who went way above and beyond with prompt clear and complete communications. She was extremely generous with her time in these communications as well. My itinerary changed after my original booking and she generously accommodated these adjustments. And then on my way out the door I misplaced an important item and I had to leave for a meeting without it. Jill so generously searched the house found my stuff and amazingly arranged to get the items to me before I left town. Plus her great sense of humor comes shining through all of her communications. I get to San Francisco one or twice a year and I hope that Lanalee's place will be free on my next trip. Thank you again for a wonderful stay. Phil"

381217,532966233,2019-09-20,3498044,Bruna,Christopher’s place was exactly as described if not better. The room was spacious and sparkling clean. And the house was located minutes from the main street. Great place to stay.
19236730,183256434,2017-08-16,67974293,Melissa,My family and I are so pleased with Jeff's accommodations. The Donatello is in the heart of Union Square just a block away from a trolley car stop. The room was amazing not only clean but well stocked with a mini frig microwave dishes and cutlery. There was construction going on outside but we didn't hear a thing. The room was surprisingly quiet for its busy location. We cannot say enough about how impressed we were. Thank you Jeff!
166199,4785974,2013-05-26,1623380,Kristian,"The Castro cottage was a great place for us to stay. Very close to Castro St and public transport. The cottage itself was cosy and there was no noise from the street. The kitchen is large enough to cook a meal and we had friends over for dinner. 
San Francisco is -as you know very hilly - but this apartment is easy to access. 
Matt was friendly and a great host. He was refurbishing his own house while we were there but it did not bother us at all.

238190,278276909,2018-06-17,509329,Mark,Great apartment in great location. The host made check in/out very easy
1421774,407630826,2019-02-02,35836267,Collin,I was in SF for business and this home was such a nice change from being at a hotel. I was able to walk everywhere and really enjoyed how quiet the neighborhood was.
19491887,544689182,2019-10-10,16286971,Casper,"On the scale from Hotel+like to ""somebody's home"" this is sort of in the middle. It's very streamlined with self-checkin lots of outlets everywhere (thaaaank you!) and a few  snacks and beers to make you feel welcome; things I might expect in a hotel. But there are also personal touches making the little flat seem like the host might live there too sometimes. I don't think she does but you get my point. There's a terrace with a really nice view and the street is on a very steep hill which is kind of fun. Definitely a great place to stay."
16255081,436284428,2019-04-12,642935,Kristoffer,Quality as expected at price point. Nothing to complain about.

The location is very convenient and safe. If you are looking for temporary housing or a place for a long-term stay I would definitely recommend this Airbnb! Urs and Kate were extremely accommodating and friendly. I also met lots of other great guests in the house as well.
24427167,285823113,2018-07-04,189112992,Sophie,Absolutely loved our stay with the charismatic duo Hector and Pierre. Can’t thank them enough for all their suggestions and the place itself is impeccably stylish X

One of the best views in the city was just up the street to the dead end.  Everything we needed was there and it was beautiful and very clean.  We were able to walk everywhere!  We would totally recommend this place!  Can't wait to go back!!!
12288524,260403584,2018-05-04,99262355,Viggie,It’s the first station for my family to visit U.S. It was a big surprise for my fam and they all really loved it! It is super clean and all the amenities are brand new! Owner and his roommate were nice and quite! It is a really decent place and I highly recommend it for families! By the way it is also located at a safe and tidy neighborhood.

Beautiful light-filled space close to public transport and wonderful neighbourhood parks and restaurants. Stacey is super-organised and her helpful notes and suggestions make for an easy and relaxing stay.
33534825,471617019,2019-06-17,57651734,Olivia,I absolutely loved staying here. Our room had a beautiful view and was very nice overall. The heated towel holder was a plus lol. The restaurant downstairs was to die for!!

830330,10240542,2014-02-08,1733845,Terra,Ramona's place is wonderful - it was perfect for us a couple with a toddler. Ramona and her family were super welcoming and told us if we needed anything to ask. But we didn't need to - everything we needed was there. Best of all this apartment is IMMACULATE: fresh and clean as well as sweet pretty and stylish.
1984709,25412691,2015-01-15,24893017,Marcus,We felt really welcomes to the apartment and it is beautifully decorated. We loved being out of the hustle and bustle of central San Francisco and the beach is just a stones throw away. Thank you for a wonderful stay.

The cosy home and my very comfy bed made a great way to start my trip. The location is fantastic with Safeways Walgreens cafes and restaurant and cool bars all within  a short stroll. Scott has lovingly renovated his entire home with vintage furniture and retro furnishings creating a homely ambiance for weary travellers like myself.

4069838,174393731,2017-07-25,60511983,Veronica,Absolutely love Ashley's place. Ashley is a very good communicator. The house was amazing. It had everything we needed and more. From maps toothbrushes towels toiletries food place suggestions etc. I enjoyed staying at her place bed was comfy. Most parking in SF is on the street Ashley's place had a garage which was very convenient. Her back yard was very cute. Wish I could've spent some time relaxing back there but was on the go most of my trip. I would most definitely recommend this air bnb.
29683753,546657044,2019-10-13,99084786,Gregory,Excellent place to stay if you’re exploring SF. The deck is very relaxing and the hospitality was outstanding.

He was really flexible. The location is good. If you are staying for 3 days The ""Muni"" passport is really convenient.

This is truly a good Airbnb experience."

Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber insbesondere auch das separate Bad und die Küche die wir mitbenutzen durften. Das eigentliche Zimmer ist klein aber ausreichend für zwei Personen das Bett ist sehr bequem die Umgebung sehr ruhig. Wir würden jedenfalls sehr gerne wiederkommen."

808660,180575765,2017-08-10,47199102,Valerie,We enjoyed our stay in David's apartment very much the bed was super comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with necessities and a few luxuries.  The neighborhood is clean and quiet unlike many tourist areas in San Francisco.  There are quite a few little bars and restaurants within a short walking distance and most of the major tourist attractions are a short uber of bus ride away.  We would definitely stay there again on our next visit!
470686,101021864,2016-09-11,9214631,Egemen,"I second everything positive thing that's been said in the previous reviews both for the apartment and the host Hao.

Prime location close to public transportation many great places nearby to grab chow. Hao is a great host respectful to his guests' privacy and very amicable.

thanks for having me !!"
7180020,45965941,2015-09-07,524739,Kate,What an amazing condo.  Well-appointed terrifically clean. Every amenity you might imagine.  And Vera could not have been more welcoming and gracious.  Totally recommend SoMa Second Home!  
9150693,92151434,2016-08-07,57885391,Megan,"Communication was great with Gary - He was very quick to reply and was able to offer answers to all our questions. Although we never got to meet the host check in was seamless.
The room was comfortable and clean. A fan was provided which helped keep the room nice and cool.
The apartment itself was a bit of a surprise for us. It's more of a hostel-like set-up: 4 bedrooms/2 bathrooms all sharing a common kitchen and couch space. This was not at all an issue and the other guests were very respectful and quiet but just not the set-up we thought it would be.
The neighbourhood was great for being close to the action of the downtown area. Lots of restaurants coffee shops etc. nearby. An easy and quick bus ride to attractions like Fisherman's Wharf Ghiradelli Square and Market Street. Also walkable to a cable car stop and right next to Chinatown. The neighbourhood did get pretty rowdy at night with the many many clubs in the area so expect to hear some music and shouting. We closed the window and turned the fan on and that really helped with that.
Finally PARKING. Something we did not think of before staying in downtown San Fransisco was where we would park our car for our stay. This is not something exclusive to this Airbnb but I'm more mentioning it for those who are looking to stay in this area in general. We parked our car at the Portsmouth Garage which is about a 5-10min walk from the suite. We felt very safe leaving our car there for 2 days and had no trouble with it. Expect to pay $27/24hrs."

7989636,52837929,2015-11-02,34561091,Stine,Best place to stay in San Francisco! I think driving up and down all those hills is a little scary but from Lindy's place everything is within walking distance.

34693459,553985891,2019-10-25,7202079,Anita,Both the room and bathroom in Tony’s place were sparkling clean with many thoughtful touches. The view on Bernal Hill (just a 10-min wall) was breathtaking. Love the sense of community in the neighbourhood. We didn’t drive but Uber was very convenient. We also bought a Muni day pass and riding around the city  had been a wonderful experience. Will highly recommended this property.
10321776,207762180,2017-10-29,80701486,Christy,Arpita’s place was perfect! It was right by the ocean and we really enjoyed staying there!

1428909,46701112,2015-09-13,9666296,Elizabeth,We had a great experience staying in Bernat's loft. The place had plenty of room great natural light and all the essentials for a long term stay. The location was wonderful—a quite safe part of the Mission just around the corner from several amazing restaurants. While we didn't interact with Bernat often he was always quick to respond and very helpful when we reached out with questions.
678556,8936632,2013-11-26,3086520,Nellie,Lorraine was a great host! First of all before we arrived to San Francisco Lorraine contacted me and gave me great instructions. Our plane was delayed and she sent me a sweet text  to see if we were ok. The place is perfect. The location is phenomenal! It is literally walking distance from Golden Gate park and you have two muni stops by her house Line 5 and 21. Both lines practically take you to all the main locations in San Francisco. The place is very clean! The only disadvantage is that it doesn't have a kitchen but there are restaurants walking distance from her home. I really enjoyed my stay here…OH YES IT IS A BUS RIDE AWAY FROM THE BEACH!!! 
5013816,27668455,2015-03-09,27732711,Violetta,"Jeff was a great host and always quick to respond. The room was very clean with high ceilings large closet and beautiful updated bathroom. It even has heated floors! It is located in a great area right next to coffee shops ( Starbucks cross the street) restaurants and all the shops on Fillmore St. I highly recommend staying at Jeff's place!
Thank you Jeff!"

The suite is located in a quiet friendly area and is walking distance to The Haight-Ashbury neighborhood it is also conveniently located nearby public transportation. The suite itself was very comfortable and holds many helpful amenities. If I ever found myself in San Francisco I would definitely consider staying here again.
6145605,319571287,2018-09-06,179064153,Shalita,Great little place! Location is good super close to inner city so traffic was never really an issue. Place was clean and the beds are comfy! They also offer a parking spot. It’s a bottom unit so sometimes there is a little noise that comes through from upstairs but nothing crazy. The owner is really nice and gets back to any inquiries pretty quickly. Would definitely stay here again!
7220035,226843149,2018-01-12,5407623,Alejandra,Mija's place is great and in a truly quiet corner. Simple but with everything I could have possibly needed. The walk down the hill in the morning was pleasant. I did take a ride back up the hill at the end of the day though!
5804060,33911029,2015-06-02,21769901,Joseph,Great location. Short walk to union st and fort mason. Short car ride to all other parts of the city. The 1 bed 1 bath was clean well lit and very nice. Perfect stay for our long weekend in SF highly recommend this spot.

2736358,149126647,2017-05-02,68158595,Ann,This is a beautiful home in an absolutely amazing area of San Francisco.  The unit is compact but had everything we needed to feel at home.  The bed was very comfortable; the WiFi always worked; the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful.   It was amazing to look out the beautiful French doors and see a lush (Website hidden by Airbnb) beautiful!   As is noted in the description of the unit there is no kitchen.  There is a tiny refrigerator and a toaster oven and coffee maker but you must wash your dishes in the bathroom.  The location is excellent for access to Golden Gate Park and the Haight - Asbury neighborhood.  It took only minutes to have an Uber or Lyft car at the door to take us to other locations in San Francisco.  There are fun cafe's restaurants and bars within an easy walk of this home.  Our host Sara replied quickly to any text we sent her regarding our stay.  We were very satisfied with our experience.  
10603148,229302656,2018-01-22,40953757,Carly,John is a fantastic host; extremely welcoming & nothing is too much trouble. The location is ideal being a 10mins walk from Lombard St & a further 10mins walk to Fisherman’s Wharf. Cleanliness is top notch & the roof terrace is to die for  We stayed for 2 nights & our only regret is that we couldn’t stay for longer! Thank you again John for your wonderful hospitality... we wouldn’t hesitate to return & recommend others to do the same Carly & Jess
680288,46575860,2015-09-12,25756332,Deborah,Brilliant place in a great location. Just a few minutes walk from the Bart station and the bus stop to fishermans wharf.

It's quiet clean and very convenient. Easily park your car in the street. The only one shortcoming is that the water from the shower is too hot.

2026910,19512100,2014-09-14,395193,Wainer,We had a very good experience  @ Bree house.  It was exactly like in the pics... I will say even better!  Very good taste in everything  nice furniture and lot of details which made the house cozy and comfortable.  We also found many amenities like in a 4* hotel and Bree offered us stuff for breakfast and first day necessities. The location was also very nice and quite and very close to the nice Golden Gate Park.
10789339,162165793,2017-06-19,6098379,Rick,"Great location Amazing view all day long!!

32162233,433090354,2019-04-05,22260282,Simone,Really amazing value for such a great location it was super easy to get there from the airport and it was so easy to use public transportation to get around from there just a block from a major road. I loved Camille's hospitality and swift/detailed communication she really gave me so much peace of mind as I planned my trip and as I arrived in San Francisco for the first time. I loved that my door had it's own locked code door. The shower is also so nice!!! Please be aware that the walls are super thin and ear plugs served me well so I could get a peaceful night's rest in the super comfy bed! Everyone was very considerate though the noise was never much of a problem. I would definitely stay again.
12511163,546623856,2019-10-13,5970890,David,Excellent host. Would stay again.
5345792,70598915,2016-04-18,6036071,Nikita,"The week I spent at Leo and Daniel's place was easily the best Airbnb experience I have ever had. 
It is the coolest place I have ever stayed in with the warmest hosts I have ever had. The place felt like home but somehow also felt like I was at a luxurious spa. Leo and Daniel were genuinely friendly nice affectionate and easygoing. They made me feel so much at home while at the same time gave me tonnes of space to be on my own unwind and relax. We got along really well they even invited me to eat and drink with them and I didn't feel at all like I was on a hectic business trip. The neighbourhood was excellent walking distance from Mission and Castro hot spots and the view from their living room was gorgeous (you can see the whole city!). 

Their place is a work of art and excellent design and speaks of how creatively talented the two of them are. Everything in the apartment was beautiful and trendy yet intuitive. For me this was a very valuable experience because when you live in a new place (especially someone's house) it can take a while to understand the simple little things e.g. how the windows open how the lights are controlled how the shower works. I have had some not-so-great Airbnb experiences in the past where the place looked fancy but the basic things were badly designed. 

Their place is also squeaky clean very spacious and has tonnes of natural light. These things are also very important to me (and can be especially hard to find and unaffordable in San Francisco).

I can't wait to stay there again when I go back to SF!! :D"
5345792,358793765,2018-12-15,19537145,Alejandra,Leo and Daniel's place is a dream. Just getting there is a breathe of fresh air in the middle of San Francisco and close to everything but in the right streets that make it a quiet peaceful place. Their home is a dream away from home totally peaceful clean and with one of the most wonderful views you'll see in San Francisco. I'd come back to stay with them again and again.
5548977,45057294,2015-08-31,28729617,Katja,Den Schlüssel konnten wir ohne Aufwand bekommen und auch mit der Checkout Zeit waren Tatyana und Tod sehr flexibel!

470686,37623929,2015-07-08,37490624,Adam,Hao was as generous as a host could be offering to share his fabulous living space with a stranger he even dropped me off to my next destination. He was more than happy to share his insight on San Fran living and recommendations on restaurants and hot spots.

633629,322662631,2018-09-13,13803154,Stephen,What a great experience. Andrea and her family are so welcoming and kind that you forget that you are staying with strangers. The room was simple but perfect for a short business (or leisure) trip. As my first experience of doing an AirBnB staying with a family it was superb!

George and Kuma were so welcoming and incredibly kind during my stay in the Castro. The room itself was very private and the bed was really comfortable! A wonderful balcony with an incredible view was the best way to start and end the day at George's. Would highly recommend George and his fabulous home to anyone visiting. Also don't worry about Kuma if you're not a cat person so so so friendly. Kuma is awesome!
14773919,475782883,2019-06-24,179963829,Anke,Man kann in San Francisco keinen besseren Gastgeber haben. Tolle Lage Downtown unkompliziert zu erreichen. Wir würden unbedingt wieder zurück zu Terry kommen.

Dons friend and neighbour Jorge managed the Check In and gave us many tipps about the city. Thank you! The appartement itself was very nice and clean. Exactly as on the pictures shown even better. The appartement has everything you need: Coffee little goods to eat and drink in the fridge. We do absolutely recommend this appartement!
Thank you Don and Jorge!"

I didn't realize until I got to the condo that it is shared with multiple other guests I assumed it was shared with the host. Personally as a solo female traveler I wasn't 100% comfortable with this but it wasn't an issue as I never even saw anyone else just heard them. 

There was some construction or remodelling happening in the condo which I had no idea about until I got there as well. But other than that everything was accurate and despite those two things I think it shows that Stella Maria really wants her guests to be comfortable. If I had a group of friends I was traveling with and could rent the entire condo then I definitely would stay."

1510363,250954235,2018-04-06,113504950,Donna,This was a perfect place to stay for our visit to San Francisco!!! It was very roomy and relaxing! A nice place to relax after a long day of walking up and down hills seeing all there is to see in San Francisco! We were welcomed with homemade scones when we arrived and there was plenty of fresh coffee for us to brew. Charlesie offered excellent advice on transportation and provided all we needed to use public transportation (which was very close by). Charlesie and Tedd are excellent hosts and we highly recommend this home to anyone planning a trip to San Francisco. Thank you for sharing your home with us!!!

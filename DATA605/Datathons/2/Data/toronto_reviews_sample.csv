1382277,51598757,2015-10-21,12912197,Brandon,Cristina was very accommodating and awesome to deal with. I made the request the morning of the day we stayed at her loft and she did everything she could do to make sure the place was ready and available for my friend and I. The location was fantastic! The distillery district is full of character and I wish we were able to spend more time there. The view from the roof is fantastic! I would definitely stay here again and would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.  
5683127,232840778,2018-02-06,171283448,Patricia,Going into Neil's place is like walking into your home. No mess and comfy. Host goes more then the mile if you ask for anything. Don't expect the Ritz but comfort and hospitality are much more. Money well spent.

Would definitely recommend!"

11123445,352724203,2018-11-25,48406170,Yvonne,We had a wonderful stay with Ann and Dave over the weekend! They (and their lovely dogs and cat) were so sweet and accommodating to us and our dog. Their cosy house was an easy drive from the city and also located just a short walk away from the lake which was beautiful to walk around. They were very thoughtful in leaving out treats bowls and a blanket for our dog. We also enjoyed learning about the story behind the honey house and tasting their delicious parmesan crisps! Thanks again for the delightful stay and we are very excited to try the honey in our upcoming recipes:)
6702085,324645344,2018-09-17,187112279,Kimberly,Very clean spacious and host extremely helpful! Perfect for those attending the Toronto International Film Festival! Ryerson theatre a block away. I will book again and recommend readily. Great place to hang your hat and feel like home
24388472,353129823,2018-11-26,226309200,Duncan,Definitely a great spot to book if you're downtown and want to stay in a dog friendly place. There's a great park across the way and the ease of access to everything was a huge plus. Hannah was also incredibly responsive to questions and there was no issue checking in whatsoever. A perfect 1st airbnb experience!
32156739,488740055,2019-07-15,5833929,Wai Sze,Chintan's place is conveniently located and near many attractions. It was our first time in Toronto and we enjoyed our stay here. The condo was clean and bright with a nice view. Although you can hear the trains as they go by we never had trouble sleeping at night. The designated underground parking spot is right next to the elevator which was nice for unloading luggage. Thanks for a great stay!
23091057,479261809,2019-06-30,207647350,Austin,房源不由房东本人管理入住时交流十分无效且不友好｡等待入住时间超过一小时｡
28336416,489395617,2019-07-16,187029504,Manu,Nice and clean place. Host was very polite and a nice person. No hastles with parking and for any issues they reply very quickly.
19363284,207189818,2017-10-28,23005441,Heverton,Amazing place Perry was very accessible and helpful. The communication was very easy. Checkin and Checkout quickly and easy and perfect location!
8237869,151208519,2017-05-11,71035527,Emily,Phil was an awesome host. He was very attentive to our needs. I didn't read the description well enough (or got it mixed up with a different home) and thought there would be parking. He did mention in his description that I would need to purchase an inexpensive overnight permit. Since I missed that he was very helpful trying to help me get one.  He was also very considerate the next day - even though we had already checked out he texted me to let me know about certain sightseeing closures so we wouldn't waste our time driving out there. I really appreciate Phil's desire to help his guests have a great time. I only wished we had had time to play some music together! 
5681246,165926131,2017-07-02,79315039,Steph, Great! Awesome. Wonderful. Clean! I can't say enough positives about this home.
26028947,411154253,2019-02-11,74245428,Pallavi,"I loved Hanieh’s place! The check-in process was so simple. And Hanieh and her husband were so excited to have us. They gave us a warm welcome and made us feel at home! Hanieh quickly responded to all the questions we had. She was very prompt in handling all the doubts we had. The place is a steal deal! It’s unlike all the basement apartments in Toronto. It has large windows and loads of sunlight. It was sparkling clean and smelt nice. It’s better than most of the Airbnb’s I stayed in Toronto. The house is much better than what it looks like in the photos. It’s spacious and airy and has all the amenities. Hanieh ensures that the guests have a great experience staying at her place.
The nearest bus stop is a 6-min walk from this place and there are plenty groceries stores nearby. 
The house is warm and we stayed during really cold winters(-21 degrees C) but it had great heating. 
What I liked the most about staying at this airbnb was how Hanieh made us feel like it was our home! She and her husband respected our privacy and never bothered us with anything . 
I loved this place so much that I went ahead and booked it for another 2 months !!"
19847518,358746864,2018-12-15,99040115,Stuart,Great location very clean apartments and nicely furnished! Can not go wrong here
22019150,316109024,2018-08-30,12269187,Grace,I wasn't very satisfied with this rental. The cleanliness left a lot to be desired. As a result I cleaned the bath and kitchen myself as soon as we arrived and I straightened out other areas. The patio was quite messy. The location is fine but it's not as close to the CN Tower etc. as the description indicates. Also the hosts insisted on quiet but neighbors had a porch party while we were there and we heard loud thumping music one night. Parking is NOT on premises. It's behind a house about a block away. Would not recommend or stay there again.
14769025,552368712,2019-10-21,21834111,Laura,This place was perfect for me as I ran the Toronto Waterfront Marathon and the start line was 5 min away. The apt was clean and basic. Check in was super easy (I personally love a lock box esp when flights are often delayed and you don’t have cell service). The neighborhood had late night food good coffee places to grab basics. Art Museum really close by. Easy walk to Kensington Market.
17720579,202954851,2017-10-13,64059067,Lee,Thanks for the stay!

1570675,25104867,2015-01-06,1979941,Bernarda,We had a great stay in Alex and Snezhana's place. It is really clean quiet and nice. We had everything we needed. The description of the place is accurate. The bus station is really close and with a bus and the subway you are downtown in no time. Public transport runs late too so we didn't have any issues returning late home. Alex was a great host helping us with everything we needed. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you!
9785414,65456048,2016-03-13,62319289,Bernard,"JP was a great host

I'm pretty much like to be alone and have some private time which the  host is very efficient and sweet  gave me immediate response only  when I had questions or need assistance.

I would go back again and recommend their place to a friend in a heartbeat. It was so clean and spacious and the view was absolutely incredible. They were so easy to communicate with and even left us a bottle of wine! Definitely an awesome 5 star place!

14726041,289990649,2018-07-13,179986653,Kimberley,Place is in a great location but the rest you can forget about!  Was made promises of fixing a broken couch and a delivery of an portable air condoning unit as the bedroom on the second floor has no vents never came in.  And really they didn't care!  The basement bedroom is right beside the furnace which goes all night and there is no door to close off the sound and no curtains in a few of the bedrooms.  The top floor bed is just a hard single couch which you can't sleep on.

Only thing I ran into was we weren’t able to park 3 cars on the driveway overnight bc the driveway was being done which wasn’t made clear. But he let us park on the grass which wasn’t a problem. Everything else was great. Highly recommend!
32522069,453708272,2019-05-16,30615977,Tammy,This space was super cute and located in a great area really good for a single traveller or couple.

Ossington Ave was a great place to explore. We used Uber a lot to get downtown as Toronto doesn’t have the best transport links but I would recommend Little Italy."

It was very convenient that large grocery store like Longo's was right across the street. My wife liked it very much.

More than anything Nancy was very kind and responsive.  She even let me use her private storage since the flight to my next destination was hours after the check out."

13605471,133079426,2017-02-20,3119300,Tara,This place is magical! What a perfect oasis. My boyfriend and I are very familiar with Toronto but were looking for something different to experience the city. Brett's cottage is truly an escape from Toronto without leaving it. Everything is perfection from each personal detail (wood fireplace beautiful sliding doors that chandelier!) that went into building the cottage to the accessible everyday comforts in a home to the garden which we hope to experience when the weather's better to the walking-distance accessibility of shops/restaurants/parks/transit/LCBO etc... This is a gem you must experience for yourself - or don't so it's available for us to return to! If you're searching for a place to recharge and feel as though you've had a week's vacation this is it. Brett was excellent with communicating and though we didn't meet him he was a fantastic host. Thank you for sharing your humble abode!!!
21765294,337828348,2018-10-17,218972314,Mike,Great place. Outstanding location. Perfect size and amenities.
3271579,199694504,2017-10-02,140472182,Katy,Liane allowed my film crew to film in her place for a docu-series interview. She was very responsive and accommodating.  The place looks great.
15698833,166359770,2017-07-03,4846,Jeff,Great place that's not too far from the downtown core. You'll need public transport to get downtown or an Uber but the flat is a nice clean quiet place in a friendly neighbourhood.

10121791,61269898,2016-02-01,24129827,Kathleen,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this stay. James and Julie do a phenomenal job: easy communications super-helpful and simply some of the nicest AirBnB properties (and hosts!) to be had in the city. I was the first visitor at this one and what a treat it is. This beautifully dressed condo has a very efficient lay-out and offers a degree of amenity that few can match in this price-range. And not one but TWO cozy bedrooms! I look forward to returning again and again - especially in the summer to luxuriate on that deck. *sigh* 
What ARE you waiting for? Click that 'reserve' button right this minute!"

19972194,565499169,2019-11-17,137408359,Linh,I stayed with Maggie for a month. I love this place because of the location and the host. The location is really close to Mimico Go train which is convenient for me as a professional working downtown. There are also TTC bus stops right across the street. It is a safe neighbourhood with the fantastic Sanremo bakery and local grocery shops nearby. Maggie is an outstanding host who will respect your privacy and still take care of any of your concerns to make sure you have an enjoyable stay.

It's a quick walk to the subway so getting anywhere  in the city is really easy. Stephanie was great to communicate with. She was quick to respond and made check in and check out super simple. The space itself was clean and really nicely decorated- It had everything I needed! Thanks Stephanie I hope to be back soon :)

27021257,455317765,2019-05-19,38660179,Jody,Janet’s place is as charming as it looks. The garden is a fabulous oasis for relaxation and the house is filled with interesting touches. The location is great- just a couple blocks away from the subway so getting around is a breeze. The home is filled with sunshine so if you’re not an early riser bring a sleep mask or take the bed in the “zen den” which is totally dark. Janet was a wonderful and thoughtful host.
5085314,274188417,2018-06-08,110877448,Leanna,I would totally recommend staying at Louise’s place . It is beautiful with a gorgeous new kitchen with all cooking amenities.  The backyard garden and patio is cute and so nice to relax in. Beautifully decorated with lots of space. It’s is literally a hop skip and jump to subway and neighbourhood surrounding has lot of restaurants and shops nearby. I would definitely stay here again

Communication was great and Gulia was always very responsive.  
Her place was extremely bright and clean.....and the location.....WOW!  Couldn't have been better!!  Within walking distance to literally everything! 
We had an amazing sleep too; the bed was one of the most comfortable  we've ever had.  
We would highly recommend Gulia's place and would gladly return in a heartbeat!"
309402,61606800,2016-02-06,56115990,Mikey,"I had an amazing stay it was cut short which was very disappointing but it happens. Christina is very kind and interesting I wish I had her motivation to run she's a very busy body.

I would highly recommend staying at this location. Free parking and location were also added perks to the place.

Enjoy"
16632051,149703255,2017-05-05,47196907,Kimberly,This was my first ever Airbnb stay and it was absolutely great!

13642694,186793617,2017-08-25,27606919,Rebecca,We had a nice time at Ceu and Stewart's they were around or easy to get in touch with before and throughout the stay making everything smooth an easy. They are sweet and nice to chat with. They're place is more spacious than I thought from the photos which was a nice bonus. It is easy and convenient to get to downtown on the bus or streetcar but also equally easy to go out to Etobicoke or Mississauga if necessary. Also their pup Chase stole my heart he's such a cutie.
790887,340634127,2018-10-24,152990529,Gary,"Robert is an excellent and thoughtful host anticipates your needs and is fantastic at making you feel at home. No ""awkwardness"" at Robert's."

37495094,534203986,2019-09-22,91356956,Derek,Val was a fantastic host. The check in procedure was simple and quick the place was spotless and exactly as described. We had a simple user error (my fault) during check in and Val was able to help me within seconds. I would be happy to stay there again no complaints.

House is very clean. Kitchen utensils and equipment are sufficient and clean. All bedrooms spread on three levels with plenty of privacy which make it very suitable for group travellers.
Angie is a good host. Very easy to communicate and always respond promptly on all queries."

13992920,164239990,2017-06-26,6329118,Deidra,Michelle's place was beautiful! The room was bright and cheerful and we were excited to see fresh towels and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived. The bed was divine! I slept like a rock here. Soooo quiet and peaceful and conducive to rest. Michelle was great in providing suggestions for restaurants to meet my dietary needs and Darryl helped me sort out some transportation questions. When they knew we would be arriving home late they left the lights on so we could make our way safely upstairs. Michelle and Darryl were both just lovely and I would highly recommend a stay here!
32698291,562303964,2019-11-10,132857495,Tori,Fran & Lucas’ place was just as I expected lovely. My boyfriend & I stayed in their beautiful place while visiting Toronto for the first time. The location was perfect. Everything you need within walking distance! We didn’t mind bearing the cold to explore by foot but we also used the streetcar from time to time. Fran was very responsive & always in a timely manner. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay & it definitely made the trip 10x better. We will most definitely consider them for our future trips to Toronto! Thanks so much Fran & Lucas!

8195595,497465556,2019-07-28,111656634,Emily,"This is truly an amazing location and the accommodation is truly a cultural gem. The host is kind and thoughtful. My favorite qualities of this location included:
- the alkaline water shower 
- top movie for each decade (2015-2018)
- the collection of records and record player
- mini fridge inside the room
-proximity to everything!!! ( financial district shopping)"

2746751,65218879,2016-03-12,11847804,Brigid,My husband and I moved to Toronto and used Alex's place as a base while we were setting up. Alex was a fantastic host and even drove us and all our things to our new apartment! The apartment was clean light and spacious. It had everything we needed. The location is very convenient for the subway and a short walk to all the downtown sights.
24238857,261608514,2018-05-06,8758151,Kirsten,Great location - short walk to grocery store restaurants bars etc. long walk (but feasible) to the core of downtown or a half block walk to the tram line. This is a small space - essentially a bedroom with a fridge/sink/stove against one wall and small washroom but it great value considering the close proximity to downtown! The building is a bit older and kind of dingy but the bed felt clean and cosy.
3802093,117061882,2016-12-04,27176633,Sonya,Cher's apartment is a lovely and clean home. It was very well equipped with spare keys plenty of towels extra linen speakers shampoo etc. The bed in the master bedroom is one of the most comfortable that I have slept on. The location allows easy access to shops bars and restaurants but is on a quiet street. It was everything I could have hoped for my week long stay in Toronto. Highly recommend!
5116831,57147510,2015-12-22,14798895,Joe,Elizabeth's place was great. Very cozy and close to tons of local shops and attractions. Streetcar right outside the door. Bigger than expected being above a storefront absolutely no complaints. Would gladly stay there again.
23110484,240675065,2018-03-05,102143711,Sarah,Perfect location and beautiful place! It was very clean and we appreciated the extra bedding and coffee that was available.
1124771,19069135,2014-09-06,6680901,Nisha,"Jon welcomed us to the apartment and was extremely friendly and helpful. The apartment is about a 15 minute walk from Christie station which was easy to get to form the airport. However is a 3 minute walk from the streetcar at College and Crawford Street which is a quicker walk.

College street also has an abundance of restaurants shops and amenities. Plenty of places to go out for dinner/drinks/dessert which are wonderful. The great thing is they are a short walk away but you don't hear a thing from the apartment. 

The apartment was clean and as pictured. Was in a great location as previously mentioned and has a wonderful bookshelf which is great for those who like to read. Be aware that if you are over 6ft tall the ceiling is of a low height in parts of the apartment (not many). 

We had a wonderful stay at the apartment and would highly recommend Jon and Erin as hosts! "

892352,42036662,2015-08-10,7076470,Brian,Matthew's place is perfect for those looking for a bright open space with a cool/comfortable artists vibe. There were four of us staying there and we loved the entire place. So much light filling up the place. Communication with Matthew was extremely easy. He is quick to respond and was very welcoming. The place is perfect for going out to the best restaurants in the area and is only a quick 10 minute walk to the Kensington Market. There is construction all around the area but we never heard a sound from the place. I cannot recommend this place more! Lots of seating to relax and enjoy company. The espresso machine is a very nice touch and we made full use of it.
26662976,426621221,2019-03-21,173880076,Bamdad,This place was extremely clean and nice. A cozy place which is all you need to stay while in a vacation. Would recommend them with no doubt to others.

Everything was just as presented and I especially loved the surprise of having access to a blender in the kitchen. Easy communication the entire time made this a lovely stay.  
24715211,498956483,2019-07-30,201317641,Sophie,La maison de Barbara est spacieuse chaleureuse tout est accueillant et confortable avec les chats les tableaux les plantes... Barbara est une femme tellement sympathique et bienveillante c'est vraiment une très belle rencontre ! La chambre et la salle de bain destinées aux voyageurs grandes très propres vous avez votre espace personnel. Barbara prépare tout ce qu'il faut dans et à côté du frigo pour votre accueil et votre petit déjeuner. Ensuite elle est toujours disposée à aider et à renseigner. Le quartier est universitaire il est agréable et calme. Si vous logez là pour visiter la ville il faut savoir que le trajet en métro est relativement long pour aller en ville (au moins 30 mn selon où vous allez) mais cela permet d'être dans un quartier tranquille et une maison unique vous ne trouverez pas mieux proche de centre. Merci Barbara pour ce beau séjour !
15888319,205672870,2017-10-22,152170267,Stefan,Great place in an awesome location really clean and exactly like the pictures. Host was great and very informative!
35374592,558106348,2019-11-02,204052632,Yi-Ching,Amazing day and night views of CN tower high rise buildings and the lake.  It is very clean beautiful and comfortable with everything that we need.   Detailed instructions and helpful videos were provided to make the check-in and check-out process so smooth.  Thoughtful notes with the appliances usage are helpful.  The location is great close to many tourist attractions and a subway stop is just across the street of the building.  Free parking space is another plus.   We will definitely stay here again.

1550882,18833255,2014-09-01,13600552,Ethan,"Alvaro's place was great really clean and well-furnished. We were a group of 5 and found it slightly cramped as we were exchange students and had a huge amount of luggage on us. However it was a relatively short stay and other groups of 5 with less baggage will find the apartment spacious.

There are power outlets available throughout the apartments (unlike some of the places we stayed in) so it was really convenient when it came to plugging in our devices.

Location-wise it's really near the busstop from which a short ride brings you to York Mills Subway Station so it's pretty convenient.

Alvaro was a good host and even when he wasn't around his sister-in-law lives in the same block so we could seek help from her anytime.

To sum up I will say that it was a really great stay! :)"
16779632,225456141,2018-01-06,122937879,Daphnee,We had a wonderful stay and carole was a great host! The location was perfect. Moreover the stuff included in the apartment (shampoo/ things to cook / spices) were very useful!! I definitely recommend it.
1162890,38059755,2015-07-12,37622670,Emily,Perfect space for two guests but a little rough for anyone taller than 6'!  Easy access to downtown and plenty of places to walk to in the neighborhood.

21233515,354111157,2018-11-30,225900465,Steven,"Just a 15 minute walk to the entertainment district and there is restaurants just around the corner.

The bed in the den is a nook which does lack privacy and the bedroom door is a frosted glass door which does allow sound to transmit between the bedroom and the living room. So if you are a light sleeper you might want to rent this suite by yourself instead of sharing.

If you are travelling with family or by yourself it's a very nice suite!  (I was travelling with a co-worker so I unintentially got to really know my co-worker)"
14471969,299721850,2018-07-31,113562987,Nhien,It was a great location for people who likes to explore the city on foot. We walked to downtown and Chinatown everyday. It is also a nice walk to the lake with food and drinks in the area. The airbnb itself is very nice with amenities like gym pool hot tub leisure area.

Let us stay much later than the original heck out time which allowed us to leave our luggage there and spend another day in the city before leaving without having to drag our stuff everywhere. Would definitely recommend staying here. Great location great place great host. Thanks Quinn!

Don't expect to cook your own food as the 'fully equipped kitchen' was missing some very essential items such as plates more than one set of utensils a working oven."

Jane and Chris were always very friendly and they helped us with the reception of the bags that arrived two days later. Overall the stay was excellent."

7141416,103634666,2016-09-23,54413020,Sophie,Stephanie's apartment is located in a great neighbourhood within easy walking distance of most attractions. It was bright and clean with very comfy bed and a fantastic view from the balcony. Stephanie was super lovely and accommodating of all my requests (including storing my bags for an extra couple of hours due to a late flight out). I'd definitely stay with her again!

12089250,151608362,2017-05-13,108492475,Troy,Great place to stay! Highly recommend it
15718503,144086760,2017-04-14,65091916,Xena,Stev is a great host. So friendly and hospitable and very knowledgable about his surroundings. He can give you some great reccomendations for food coffee shops entertainment Etc. The place was lovely And very comfortable. Great view and it was nice to call it home for two weeks. 
15549284,213855083,2017-11-23,30236961,Joshua,Very close to whatever a busy traveller will need & just a cool neighborhood either way just enough space to call home a short while
21108565,246017932,2018-03-24,177524106,Simon,Place wasn't as nice in person as it seemed in the photos however it was comfortable. Some issues with checking in - app was confusing and didn't work for us which was stressful after a long flight. Noisy neighbours and noise from express way.  Overall an okay stay but not worth the price.
16362687,172038180,2017-07-19,70158470,Elliott,"Karen's loft was one of my most enjoyable experiences. It was even better-looking in person than the photos suggest. Everything in the description is accurate to a ""t"" and the local restaurants and shops are all wonderful. Over all I'd say the price is great and there's plenty to do within walking distance for virtually anyone. "
1179509,9731367,2014-01-06,9977429,Sarah,"I highly recommend staying with Cara - first and foremost because of the woman herself. She is welcoming kind and enthusiastic about life. She gives an excellent introduction to the city and makes you feel at home. She's created a useful list for guests of things to do and places to eat and you can't beat the location. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Thank you Cara! You're the best.

23899304,287810583,2018-07-08,199328807,Barkatali,Amazing view no need to go to CN towers you can see most of the city from 55th floor.
29535609,412040685,2019-02-14,105070371,Jon,This should be a 6 star rating for value. a great choice if you need a room only
12065680,151205054,2017-05-11,74410336,Celia,Dave and Anika are soooo nice.They give us a lot of useful information  bring us so much convenience in Toronto.The room is as it is described !Tidyclean and cozy!
10468084,81583594,2016-06-23,60001865,Ian,Kyla and Etienne were bursting with recommendations on what to do in the city and were genuinely invested in me having as great of a time in Toronto as possible.  Good duders.
15043417,316563432,2018-08-31,28697570,Yamil,Buena relación calidad precio ubicación.  Laure fue muy hospitalaria y comunicativa.

9975789,165029410,2017-06-30,131689740,Tina,We really enjoyed our stay here.  No complaints.  This made it really easy travelling with two kids.  Even got to enjoy the pool and hot tub.  Would stay again for sure.
3911896,52306686,2015-10-28,18074719,Caroline,Great flat loved the spacious kitchen with natural light.  Comfy bed.  Amazingly quiet.  Useful Asian supermarket on Bloor Street good bars there too.  Fine baked goods in Portuguese town --easy to get around with the very convenient metro and trams.  We enjoyed visiting the nearby Kensington Market for vintage clothes and myriad ethnic food outlets.  Simon was kind host flexible about arrival and departure; fresh flowers and gleaming kitchen to greet us and really good space to relax in during our visit -- we hope to book this flat again on any future visit.  NB if you make toast the smoke alarm is liable to go off -- it makes quite a racket-- open the doors to the roof patio.  
13694811,277502870,2018-06-16,125002918,Eliot,Anton was an AMAZING host. There wasn't a moment that he wasn't polite respectful and responsive to any queries and questions we had. The apartment was immaculate and there wasn't a thing missing. It had a well equipped kitchen a very chic & stylish living room and the high ceilings made the condo feel generously spacious. In the Toronto it’s a rare not to be overlooked by neighbours or look directly into someone else’s home and this  privacy was unexpected and a welcome change from most city stay experiences. Bravo.
34926317,460952993,2019-05-30,34821423,Shaun,Great location mid town close to Art Gallery of Ontario and short walk from subway. china town right near by UofT and OCAD and walking distance to most downtown attractions. Great communication with host. I was traveling for work so was very convenient for me. The room is original - tidy but not brand new. The condo was quiet and the rooms overlooked the courtyard which would be very nice in the summer. Will definitely recommend and rebook for my next trip. Thanks!!
17559704,413492653,2019-02-17,1400407,Alon,This is a beautifully designed and maintained space. We were two individuals and it worked perfectly with private space and separate bathrooms for each of us as well as fully equipped communal space. We held dinners and meetings around the large table and enjoyed cooking in the large and well stocked kitchen. Too cold to use the patios but I can imagine the joy they bring in spring and summer. Highly recommended.
25017511,327899464,2018-09-24,6745840,Brad,Sue’s place exceeded our expectations. We stayed there with our infant and our parents - it was the perfect place for the whole family. Sue provided everything we could have thought of to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. The lovely roof top patio and great location were the highlight for us.
4399426,124770696,2017-01-02,80037121,Kianna,I feel awful having to give a bad review but unfortunately there is no way to go around it. The place itself wasn't the worst our main problems were with the host herself. After arriving at the scheduled check-in time we called her and found out she was not even in the city. She then told us to come back 2 hours later so we did and she again was not there. Her father eventually ended up coming to let us in at 9 pm which was 5 hours later than our check-in time. We were then snuck in through a back door so security wouldn't see us which made us realize she does not have permission to even be using Airbnb. In the apartment itself we then found blood on the top sheet which is a huge health hazard. After letting her know and asking for some sort of discount she was then unreachable for the rest of our stay. After contacting Airbnb about the situation they apologized for us on her behalf and even gave us one day's worth of money back! The photos in the listing show a separate living room with a couch however which didn't exist. The place itself is just a bachelor apartment with kitchen one on side and bed on the other.  There was also no shampoo conditioner body wash or soap to be found. Kitchen had no toaster baking sheets or oven mitts that we could find either. The blinds to the balcony are also very flimsy and kept falling out whenever we went near them. Although the house smelled like cleaning products when we first got there that smell eventually lingered and it smelled like garbage the rest of our stay. The pool and gym were great though and we were able to us it almost every day. If you are looking for a hassle free stay in Toronto I would recommend staying elsewhere and would not personally stay here again. 
30817570,561490239,2019-11-09,96658190,Claudia,Nice room quiet and clean! The best location and great neighboorhod! Rolando is a great host!

4490925,47143723,2015-09-16,32339317,Phil,We were delighted with this flat in central Toronto. As a family of 4 with 2 adult sons we found the accommodation perfectly adequate despite other reviews. Jerry and Nat were very friendly and helpful and all major attractions were within easy walking distance.
24627335,516697925,2019-08-24,276671343,Bee,I absolutely loved staying at jem's. I loved the view. It was stunning! I love cooking and i was happy to find a more than enough cooking utensils but the smoke detector kept going off almost every minute which was a lil annoying but thats pretty much it. Its close to the  water front for a lovely evening stroll and close to the train station too. Definitely staying here again! Thanks Jem!!
6092042,85085688,2016-07-10,78719284,Mariah,This listing was wonderful for our needs - central location exactly as pictured with close amenities to both practical living essentials and tourist-y acitivities. A good size for two but could fit more people easily in the living area. Rajnee was very accommodating with flexibility regarding check-in and check-out time. When we were here she made herself extremely available for any concern or inquiries. The email that accompanied the reservation was continent and informative as well. Friendly and professional would definitely stay here again! 
14809607,259786516,2018-05-02,135136417,Aymeric,Rubing has been a great host I really want to thank him for that. Everything was perfect. And if you need anything you can ask him anytime ! Great place in central Toronto everything is close by. 5 stars.

19094099,559223147,2019-11-03,269082843,Ivy,"This loft was everything I expected! So impressed!
 My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary here and I surprised him with our Airbnb. He absolutely loved it! The exposed brick and loft style was a hit!
 The loft was spotless and spacious. It had everything we needed and it was well worth the cost.
 Marie was lovely and super accommodating! We will definitely be back!
Thank you so much!"

7915935,281775832,2018-06-25,31802685,Gillian,Beautiful home with lots of space. This is great value for a group or family compared to staying in hotel rooms. Common areas were very comfortable; the kitchen was beautiful and had absolutely everything we needed including cappuccino maker and wine fridge! Private garden in the back was a bonus. We will be back!

15770518,340016445,2018-10-22,191351964,Danielle-Marie,Can't beat the location was the perfect place located right downtown near everything we wanted to see. Our only issue was the only one out of 3 elevators was operating for 27 floors of people the entire time we were there which was annoying. Other than that A plus for everything else
1066718,528213869,2019-09-12,7844289,Amanda,Great location! Very clean and the outdoor patio space is such a wonderful and beautiful perk of this place! Would definitely recommend.

6795531,35051088,2015-06-14,29053328,Natasha,Condo was clean and comfortable. Mika was a pleasant and thoughtful host.

38219341,543830968,2019-10-08,122118589,Tanya,Very fast responses and very hospitable. The location was perfect because of how close it was to the airport. Would recommend
35065265,484271853,2019-07-08,237137017,종우,Don't reserve this house. The living room was so dirty that many cockroaches were wandering our house. I confuse whether this house is for humans or for cockroaches. Of course there's no shampoo no toiletries no tissues. To make matters worse wifi didn't work. This was my first house where wifi did not work. So if you want to reserve this house you have to expext to use your own data. One more one of two rooms is very hot to sleep on summer because there's no way to control the temperature of it. But the house is not unlivable.
20637798,223665091,2018-01-01,67058138,Sarra,Sulabh has a very convenient place it is in the basement of his home so with that being said bring clothes to bundle up as basements tend to be cooler especially in the winter. Although when we asked he provided us with a space heater. I recommend making sure that you know exactly what you are getting before you book. For example the listing showed that there was kitchen available outside from the master bedroom for use however he had other guests booked there too and we had limited use because it was in their section due to no fault of the host the guests kept the door shut making it awkward to go in there to store our leftovers in the fridge. He was nice enough to set up an air mattress for our third guest although we thought it was going to be set up outside of the bedroom to give us some privacy but it was not as there was no other space. Overall it was a convenient and spacious place to stay for the one night we needed it during our trip for NYE. Him and his co-hosts are very sweet and helpful. I would stay here again if i am ever in town for a short trip! Thank you Sulabh!
3684349,294918370,2018-07-22,47061308,Jenny,We had a bit of trouble entering but Pedram was very helpful and helped us solve the issue quickly!
818228,161320078,2017-06-17,4396291,Maxime,Beautiful neighborhood surrounded by great restaurants and bars. Easy to get to and safe. Amy and Greame are very kind and easy to talk to.  They made sure I felt at home. I'm already planning to come back!  Thanks again for an amazing stay.

17235075,529267409,2019-09-14,47092829,Nicole,I've stayed at Sylvie place just for two night. The place is safe in a very nice neighborhood and since I wad alone this was important to me. Despite some misunderstanding at the beginning for the address Sylvie was very helpful and very kind to me!
25841437,422051769,2019-03-10,60757957,Marcus,Great stay! Amazing location
25112797,436622518,2019-04-13,60258988,Larisha,Markus's home was exactly as expected. We needed a convenient and accessible place to stay and this was the perfect home. Despite us booking last minute Markus very responsive  and was very helpful through out the process. The home was very clean and private. The only thing I would say is the bed was too soft which made it a bit difficult to sleep in. Other than that it was a wonderful home to stay in and the location was perfect!
24056208,271509329,2018-06-01,176860261,David,Great place and stay. Couldn't ask for anything more.
14715779,131531169,2017-02-12,97327296,Arushi,Great location! Just like the pictures- very clean and well decorated space. 
11359841,64879182,2016-03-08,32293430,Raymond,We (another guest and I) stayed at Troy's place for a night during our visit to Toronto. He was very responsive and accommodating which was great and the place itself is absolutely pristine. The only possible issue is that the ceiling is a little low but anyone who is 2-3 inches above average height would be just fine. Definitely one of the best places I've stayed and only enhanced the Toronto experience.
21028107,304425951,2018-08-09,150499764,Miguel,"What a great value!

Totally recommend.

29561176,409703937,2019-02-08,231969601,Robert,I can recommend This apartment to anyone wanting a downtown location which is well kept. comfortable. clean. with perfect views. definitely 5 stars. Our host was very communicative and quick to respond. Thank you for making our stay very enjoyable.
449650,107165892,2016-10-09,55278831,Barbara,Abi is a very good communicator both prior and during the stay at her home.  She is very accessible and  addresses concerns quickly.  The house is close to both Queen and King streets with lots of restaurants shops and coffee houses to explore.  The neighborhood has a lot of charm.  The house can accommodate several people and there is a crib and a child-sized bed (and play area) on the third floor along with the master bedroom which makes it very family friendly.  And the two bedrooms on the second floor allow for privacy for those guests so overall it is a very nice setup.

17559704,512626174,2019-08-18,30745841,Jackie,"Would stay in Harry and Ana's place again. Our family of three had more than enough space. The house location was nice and quiet. Super convenient -- only 7 mins walk to the closest TTC station and close to a supermarket and fruit and other markets as well as tons of bakeries and restaurants. Also close to a couple of parks. 
Great spot to chill out and recharge on a vacation full of family reunion events."

27020390,569467392,2019-11-26,188919193,Ash,"Christine's place is absolutely stunning. Spotless clean well equipped well located and very comfy. The location was perfect it was in walking distance of most things in the city and being just down the road from union station to get to somewhere that's a little further from walking is easy.

Fully recommend this place and if I need an airbnb in the city again I'll be looking to see if this is available!"
15701100,201549725,2017-10-08,5847140,Christine,Lena and Dimitri's place is very clean and true to the pictures. It is well styled with comfortable furniture a useful kitchen and great bedding. One nice touch would be a blanket or throw for the couch but this would be icing on the top as the place was already pretty perfect!
8740512,562141513,2019-11-10,47713183,Stephanie,This well-styled quiet condo was in a fantastic area! We were able to walk or take short Lyft rides wherever we wanted to go. There’s a grocery store (with liquor) on the first floor of the building for easy access and we loved being on the 38th floor - great views of the city! James was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. We’ll definitely look up his place when we visit Toronto again!

20772929,367789814,2019-01-05,24271427,Fahimeh,The location is very good.  It's relatively clean. The walls are not soundproof enough and you can hear the neighbours' conversations clearly. Take extra bedsheets and towels with yourself if you are staying more than one night.
25085926,559156893,2019-11-03,305792327,Mariano,A really good place to stay close to the airport and the family is very quite and polite.

Good location just outside the heart of Downtown Toronto"
15832854,276037219,2018-06-12,102745796,Dave,James is super kind and super accommodating. He's quick to respond which was incredibly helpful because of how quickly we decided to visit Toronto. His place is in a fantastic location a block away from Yonge. It's in reasonable walking distance to pretty much everything and is super close to a train stop. I'd definitely recommend staying here if you're ever interested in seeing Toronto.
18915367,464020887,2019-06-04,27656226,Zachary,Jonathan was super quick to respond to my questions and needs and was very accommodating with the check in process.

23872685,265002495,2018-05-15,13614697,Sidney White,"My wife and I would like to thank the great accommodation for 15 days we had at Nancy's house.
Nancy and her husband were very polite and helpful in giving us great advice and directions for living in Toronto.
The house is well organized with all the necessary appliances. 
However there is a challenge which is to share one bathroom with the other guests. There are 5 rooms in the house. However we did not have major problems with that. Our stay was excellent.
If you want to stay in a in a very well located place close to the TCC bus and subway Dufrin Mall Walmart Tim Hortons MC Donald's etc this is your place."
14685177,183921876,2017-08-18,130494643,Martin,Nice place downtown! I'll go back.
35002522,566135648,2019-11-18,300320345,Sam,It was not bad but i was expecting more. Heating system was very bad and not adjustable so we were feeling cold.
6349559,112594065,2016-11-06,97766067,Yamisha,Our stay was great. We enjoyed the VIEW and location. Each of our planned activities were less than 10 minutes from the condo. We did experience a little madness with parking but that was out of Sabah's control as some jerk parked in her assigned spot the entire weekend. For anyone visiting I'd avoid that by leaving the car behind because you won't need it anyway. We walked a lot and used uber at night. 
30929282,509453205,2019-08-14,5418107,Claire,Wonderful place! Very welcoming host & place is lovely. Great location and place has everything. Very kid friendly :) highly recommended.

11324662,246490986,2018-03-25,121782954,Juliet,The location of the condo was beautiful the view was spectacular right by the CN tower. Great host! Jonathan responded very quickly and was very helpful when needed! House was spotless and beautiful. Kitchen was stocked with every utensil and so many dishes it was very useful! Overall a great place to stay would recommend to anyone looking to stay down town Toronto!

13370172,497549138,2019-07-28,159624751,Anne-Sophie,We were there with our two month old for two nights. Connie warmly greeted us upon arrival and immediately made us feel at home. She had great recommendations which helped us make the most of our stay. We loved the style of the Airbnb very cozy great decoration and squeaky clean. It helped us unwind and enjoy our stay. The neighborhood is fun to explore with parks cute shops and great groceries. We highly recommend it and would not hesitate to go back.
6702152,166182296,2017-07-02,124628371,William,The house is in a great area. Very close to the subway and great local restaurants. The room is very cozy and Maxine and Gary are great hosts. They are very helpful and knowledgeable as well as very caring. More than once they have gone above and beyond to make sure I had a wonderful time in Toronto.

19487827,319192429,2018-09-05,118747076,Ehsan,great place! mella was an amazing host. Above and beyond our expectations --a very safe building that has character. felt very cozy and bohemian
3849815,333769996,2018-10-07,82535229,Erika,I really enjoyed the central location of the place - just a quick walk to public transportation and many great places to eat and explore. Jt's communication leading up to our stay in Toronto was very timely and helpful. Admittedly the space was a bit warm but opening up the windows allowed cool breezes to flow through the place making it a comfortable place to rest after our full days in the city.
14025998,149501691,2017-05-04,6444987,Jason,"Stop searching and book now! SuperHost JetSetterJason Approved! Karen's lovely apartment sets the bar extremely high here. That's the best way to describe my stay at her home. 

The pictures are exactly as advertised. The basement apartment is cozy yet feels spacious and has lots of closet and storage space. Late night/early morning self check-in/out was seamless and Karen resides in the home upstairs and is responsive in case you need her. She is friendly and personable and made me feel very welcome. The home is easy to find located on a main road but the living quarters are quiet and feel very private. 

As a SuperHost I am very familiar hosting and traveling Airbnb and I can be a tough critic. Karen managed to meet and exceed my expectations. I even left with a few tips to improve my listing! 

The kitchen is fully equipped and Karen left a glass bottle of water in the fridge. Nice touch. The WiFi was my best friend it was easy to log into and no service interruption.

Fluffy fresh towels smelled clean and of a detergent I couldn't identify - but fluffy fresh and clean are the important words here! Soap shampoo and conditioner are also waiting for you in the sleek eclectic bathroom. 

The neighborhood feels very residential friendly and is close to public transportation bus and subway metro. Nice small restaurants within walking distance and only 15 minutes from downtown Toronto by car/taxi. Perfect location for a good balanced stay. 

Overall her home is beautifully kept and I felt comfortable right away. The entire apartment is clean and feels purposeful. Karen leaves no stone untouched. I was very impressed and recommend you stay here when visiting Toronto."
7834160,61815259,2016-02-08,9310159,Marcelle,Rick and Judy are a delight. Their apartment is lovely and well equipped and most importantly - clean! The apartment is well situated within walking distance to so many great things Toronto has to offer. We highly recommend this listing!

23960022,424989590,2019-03-17,245380599,Marta,"Having the whole space by yourself has no price! This is a small studio but it has everything you need. Close to shops and tons of restaurants and food places.
Shane has been super nice and always promptly responsive with me.
The location was perfect for me since it was right in front of the office I was working in. 3 minutes walking to the subway station 20 minutes from downtown."
6542106,54355250,2015-11-18,19758334,Meredith,"I loved the light flooding the kitchen and living area in the mornings.
We arrived a few hours late due to airline delays but Don was ready when we arrived to show us in. 
The Suite is exactly as in the pictures. It is very modern warm clean and comfortable. Everything we needed was there. It is easy to find and convenient to stores and restaurants. I would definitely recommend Don's Airbnb!

3994370,215941786,2017-12-02,130721494,Pranab,Value for money. If you just need a place to spend only the night and not shell out a fortune this is the place. The hosts are very responsive. The house is very well maintained. Pretty close to the down town area. So if the idea is to spend all your time outside and just come back for a good night's sleep this is the place to be.
15132324,104138169,2016-09-25,93534886,Jay,This home is beautiful clean and the hosts are so lovely. The location is extremely accessible with a bus stop 1 min from the door. CF Sherway Gardens mall is extremely close and Tanka was so generous to offer us a lift. Shibanee was lovely and made us tea in the morning and they both were extremely accommodating. We will visit them again!

14859789,116659352,2016-12-02,104455452,Florian,Alles war wie angegeben. Auch wenn das Haus etwas außerhalb liegt ist man mit der Tran (3 Minuten Fußweg) oder dem Bus schnell in der Innenstadt. Einzig störend war die laute Heizung die alle 10 Minuten anspringt. Alles in allem aber eine gute Unterkunft für einen kurzen Aufenthalt in Toronto.
9214758,123753180,2016-12-30,6509335,Paul,Great location and value! Stayed with my family and we really enjoyed our stay. Lots of good restaurant near by on college street and a short walk to the subway. Would definitely recommend it.

1202734,83509358,2016-07-03,71128408,Taylor,"Brahm was quick to contact us with location details since the apartment was a little off the beaten path. Once we got our bearings it was a cinch to find. The parking was handy since it was right outside the front door. The stay was cozy and accommodating for 2 adults (couple). The bathroom was probably the biggest drawback of the apartment. You needed to climb over the toilet to reach the shower and getting changed in there would only be for the flexible.
Other than the bathroom the whole place is as advertised.  We stayed there in the summer and the weather was good but there was also an AC available for use that cooled the entire apartment. I would caution staying here in the winter because insulation seemed lacking but I can't be sure. All in all I would recommend this for its central location and free parking."
33252397,525336944,2019-09-07,45942861,Kim,All is great in this space so don’t hesitate to stay here. We know Toronto well and it was a treat for us to encounter this vibrant neighbourhood again and see how much it has developed. You will love the neighbourhood coffee shops pubs and upscale restaurants. Public transit is very close so you can get downtown easily on the Queen car. The space is efficient and comfortable to spend time in. The patio is a special feature even though we didn’t use it during this stay. Don’t let the laneway access concern you. It is a very safe neighbourhood and even quieter than I expected. We’ll stay again for sure.
7349220,54536614,2015-11-21,30356946,Leonie,We had a wonderful time at Mark's place the neighborhood offers many great restaurants and pubs and public transportation is 1 min by foot. Would go there again any time. Thanks a lot.

17775203,301647718,2018-08-04,176543679,Renee,Location location location- for us the location was absolutely perfect.  We were concert goers at Rogers Centre which was literally across the street.  We walked everywhere for food shopping and entertainment.  The apartment was very clean and perfect for the five of us.  The building was very secure and safe. Would highly recommend.  Would definitely book this location again for a future trip to Toronto!!!
1732392,86317462,2016-07-16,9938436,Edgar,Excelente eleccion.   Mrs Raphael es una gran anfritiona muy calida y siempre con una sonrisa en su rostro. El apartamento es confortable y muy limpio.  La señora Raphael te brinda lo basico para el desayuno. Aunque el apartamento no està cerca del centro de la ciudad tomando el transporte publico se llega entre 45 a 55 min.   Recomendadisimo!      
2692019,35498155,2015-06-19,11098584,Fabio,"I spent a great time at Behnaz's home! I was in this beautiful condo for 45 days and everything is exactly as in the photos and also much better! Naz is a wonderful host! She's kind caring and always ready to help for anything! It was also nice to spend a bit 'of time to chat about everything. Every kind of stuff pots stoves for cooky and foody people!!! 
At Nazy's home I really felt like in my own home and I recommend to everyone that this condo is also very comfortable. The bathroom in your own room is the best! 
It is exactly in front of Eglinton Subway station and in the neighborhood you can find any type of restaurant fast-food restaurants and stores for shopping! In addition the condo has also a beautiful pool and barbecue area.
Union Station is 15 minutes far by subway. 
I think is the best accommodation for comfort price location and services and say goodbye to this place and to Naz especially was very sad for me! 
I'm sorry for my imperfect English but I'm sure you know what I mean!!! :) 

Thank you for everything Nazy I really hope to see you soon!"
32172090,432650205,2019-04-04,67633220,Matt,Shannon’s place was clean tidy and was equipped with everything we needed. We used the location for a business trip accommodation and I would highly recommend it to others looking to do the same or a couple looking for a city break.

20459195,187823019,2017-08-27,44173938,Peter,"Wonderful place to stay. Exceeded our expectations! 

We had a very warm welcome and tour of the place. Max had left us some bagels milk for coffee in the morning and even toys for our son to play with when we arrived.  

It truly felt like a home away from home. 

Great location easy to get downtown on TTC and safe neighbourhood.   

Quiet street for a good night's sleep. 

Highly recommended!"
15698833,314911088,2018-08-27,21895409,Amy,We arrived at Jason’s place late after a long day of traveling. Self check-in was easy . It was a pleasure to walk into a spotless quiet space. The apartment is located in a wonderful neighborhood with many parks in walking distance. Right down the street is the Universal Grill where we had a delicious meal. Jason is an attentive host who always communicates back to you promptly. I asked if he had a portable fan that we could use. He didn’t but went out and bought one the next day for the unit. We’ve stayed in many Air Bnbs this was one of best!
32292437,431154489,2019-03-31,108580829,Nikki,"Great place to stay in Toronto for business or for a weekend. Location is close to many different eateries and subway station. The place itself was spotless clean and smell free which made the stay that more enjoyable. 
Vikas is responsive accommodating proactive and ensures his guests has an enjoyable stay. Instructions to checking in were very easy to follow and would definitely recommend this place!"
20960321,293608368,2018-07-20,164082869,Hye Jin,호스트와의 의사소통은 굉장히 빠르고 좋았습니다. 헌데 4인가족이 머물기엔 공간이 좁습니다. 에어매트리슬 깔면 거실이 없고 식탁은 2인용이라 보조스튤을 사용해야 했습니다. 만약 개털 알러지가 있는사람은 다시한번 생각해 보길 권합니다. 그리고 우리가 사용할때에는 샤워기 수전과 세탁기 물이 역류하는 현상이 있었습니다. 그래서 바닥이 젖어 있는곳이 많았습니다. 장기여행계획인 분들은 세탁기 사용이 호스트와 같이라 마음데로 쓸수 없으니 미리 생각해야 할것입니다. 
6900207,293089345,2018-07-19,17644980,Kristy,This was a great house in a very friendly neighborhood! Everything was as we expected and the house was clean and well-stocked. The house was very stylish. The location was wonderful for us and our kids - parks were nearby and everything we needed was within walking distance. The neighbors on both sides were very friendly offering both advice and food. Britney was extremely responsive to anything we needed. A wonderful stay I highly recommend!

16263262,161768761,2017-06-18,112773564,Christina,"Alrighty! So- this was my second airbnb experience and a bit of a longer stay. It would fairly easy to find if you have service and are not foreign travelers like us who did not have service and were going off printed directions. But it's in a perfect spot! It is quiet so you can sleep if you choose but also have the ability and are right by some great clubs that are walking distance. So many shopping places and oh man what a great place to be for food. 

As for the home beautiful. It is a bit cramped for 4 adults. We slept on the pull out couch which isn't super comfortable - however you kind of know what you are getting into. This place is a bang for your buck. Very clean when we arrived had toiletries prepared in case you forgot yours. Which we forgot body wash. It was a huge window and lets in beautiful light. 

Overall if I was ever in Toronto again I would definitely stay here!

5069604,101725503,2016-09-14,65664808,James,"What a great place! My first time using AirBnB and it was an awesome experience. The suite was big with 2 beds and lots of space to unwind. A full kitchen and fridge. Very modern. The location was perfect between Dundas and Queen St W so everything was walkable for me. Honestly the location is amazing public transit is a stones throw away and the neighbourhood is cool. Amazing shops coffee joints and restaurants all within a few minutes walk. 
My hosts were outstanding. So friendly and easy to get a hold of and really helpful! They had so many great suggestions and I felt so welcome!  They were always 1 text away and responded promptly. Really enjoyed getting to know them!
Next time i am in Toronto there is no other place i would want to stay. Best location full modern suite/apt to myself and friendly helpful hosts. A great first experience with AirBnb."
5879122,243321776,2018-03-15,113599824,Emily,This is a lovely clean apartment in a very peaceful neighborhood. It’s an easy drive to downtown Toronto (~30 minutes) and even closer to areas such as Scarborough Bluffs Park. Would recommend to anyone passing through the area for a few days!
30949082,448815975,2019-05-05,15385184,Steve,This place is exactly how it's described.  The one thing the pictures cant relay are the amazing views.  The CN tower out of the Master Bedroom at night is spectacular. Nik was a great host and very attentive to all our requests and needs.
35769374,507456319,2019-08-11,198524876,Seher,"Great Stay! All separate spaces for dining living room Kitchen and bedroom which is great and rare to find downtown. The condo has nice light a really great view and balcony. The top floor is a great perk when looking at the city view. 
For any travellers please note you will have to get used to taking the bus if you want to get downtown quickly or get to food. However the 509 goes straight into downtown so I would say the location is very convenient."
28938363,525260173,2019-09-07,231864969,Christopher,Very clean and not too far from the city!

264319,459478138,2019-05-27,29572108,Alexandra,This is my second time staying at Linda's place. The location is excellent - within walking distance to Eaton Centre and a great diner called Fran's. The room itself was super clean comfortable and having the outside patio area was lovely to sit while I had my morning coffee. I highly recommend.
29408078,522184891,2019-09-01,79574509,Dragana,We absolutely loved this place. It’s right in the center of Toronto. Parking is included which was amazing. The host was also very understanding and allowed us to park some extra time after check out. No words. Definitely worth everything. We absolutely loved it and will definitely come back!!

I appreciated having such a relaxing place to stay (much better value than a hotel room) and that it was walking distance from my seminar in Liberty Village. 
33590386,505707523,2019-08-09,119496978,Dorothy,SPARKLING CLEAN!!!  Haider was a fantastic host....allowed us to access parking early and provided very detailed check in details complete with photos which made it a breeze.  Responds within minutes to any question.

19367332,174356229,2017-07-25,139340545,Jay,"Excellent location!! Halfway between the ACC and the Rogers Center. Dina is a great host. When I arrived at the airport to leave I found out my flight was delayed 2 hours. This made our prearranged key exchange out of the question. Dina responded immediately With ""I'll find a solution by the time you land"". She met me out front of the unit at 10:30pm to give me the keys. Highly recommend you stay here!!!"
10722107,403232304,2019-01-20,17719211,Michelle,T was a fabulous host and I would highly recommend his space to anyone. Myself and my friends had a girls night which was overdue. We were very much looking forward to this and T went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. The space was clean and location was fabulous. We also had our night out in Toronto on the evening of the biggest snowstorm of the year and he even made accommodations to let us check in a bit earlier for all of us that were coming in from out of town.  We had a great time!
7662848,96454015,2016-08-22,76181362,Karen,What I loved about staying at Lisa's home was that it was like my own home but with a TV! Yes it is true I don't have a TV. Lisa just happened to be out of town during the time of my stay and the place and check-in were set for my arrival. Plus it was clean mostly quiet (the place is right on bustling Younge St. and all the amenities promised were available. Before and during my stay Lisa responded in good time and she was affable and patient with my many questions about getting around Toronto. If I am ever in the city again I will definitely see if Lisa's place is available. Truly for the bottom of my heart I am really grateful for the honor of being a guest in your home.

3860565,450876479,2019-05-10,237728108,Alison,Brenda’s hospitality was most appreciated during my mom’s stay with her. Brenda is such a pleasant host who is thoughtful and concerned about her guest’s needs. It is difficult these days to find someone so in-tune with what the needs and feelings of others are. We’re so happy we met you Brenda and we hope that we continue our communication with each other. Thank you!

It made me wish it was baseball season as it's entrance was right across from the ramp which brings you to the Rogers centre. It's moments away from the financial and entertainment district. King and queen street can be easily walked too. Adam's place was also very clean making our stay very comfortable. 

Adam was very helpful and easy to contact. He answered any questions I had very promptly! 

I would definitely recommend Adam's condo to any one visiting the city! "

Gute Ausstattung.  

Das Haus hat Platz für 5 Leute.


Man läuft 10 min. zur U- Bahn und ist in 30 min. in der Stadt. Wenn man mehr als 4 mal am Tag U- Bahn fährt lohnt sich das Tagesticket.

Im Sommer kann man draußen essen. 
Einfaches Reinkommen ins Haus und man kann nicht den Schlüssel vergessen.

 Ein bisschen laut ist es an der Straße wenn man in Zimmer 1 schläft  besser Ohrstöpsel mitnehmen. 

Relative Nähe zum Strand.

6635679,191729769,2017-09-08,3923446,Angela,Peggy's place is in a good neighborhood close to lots of great food and coffee places. The suite is actually upstairs in what appeared to be the family's home. Peggy's mother was actually the one who gave me the keys and access to the house. Check out information was unclear and I had to wait roughly an hour before I received an answer from Peggy as to where to leave the keys. This place was great in a pinch but due to the lack of communication I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.
24755985,311593478,2018-08-21,204964979,Jacob,Solid location and clean room. Check-in/communication was a bit disorganized and I did not receive instruction until the last minute.

19592585,504392715,2019-08-07,281961593,Yat,"The Apartment was as advertised in the pictures stylishly decorated comfy beds and lots and lots of space for our family of 5. It would have easily slept 8 without feeling cramped and the kids enjoyed having a supersized bed each! Communication with the host was easy and we got quick replies to our questions.

Pros:
Space - lots of it!
Layout - loved the layout: 2 bedrooms off one side of the living room and another the opposite side. Living space was really lovely 
Views: Great views of the skyline from the very high balcony (Apartment is off the 44 floor!). Not for those scared of heights!
Beds and furniture - beds very comfy and generously sized! Decor was. beautiful
Cleaness - Flat was well cleaned although the cleaner was still there when we tried to check in which meant we could not get in for an hour.
Parking under the building - really handy (enough for 2 cars) although it was a little confusing to find the entrance to the car park. It's worth parking up outside reception when you arrive and just asking where to go as you can not get into the car park without the keys.
Location -  It was very well located literally opposite the CN tower Ripleys and Rogers Stadium! We pretty much walked everywhere from the flat.
Bedding and amenities - all bedding provided which was great. There was even a washer machine and dryer which was great with kids!

Cons:
Pool - Unfortunately the pool was closed without reason when we stayed which was a real shame as it was one of the reasons we booked the apartment. 
Elevators -  the elevators was out of action meaning there was a long wait for the 2 that did work so plan to leave a little earlier if you need to get somewhere at a certain time. The Host could not influence these 2 points.

Overall the Apartment was fantastic! We loved staying there - thank you for hosting us Chris."

985498,536924598,2019-09-27,105380340,Andrew,Wayne's place is a GREAT option for those who wish to visit the downtown/entertainment district in Toronto.

6198704,169455383,2017-07-12,46033680,Priscilla,The view is fabulous and the location is very central to all of the sights. The size is small but we had everything we needed for the 3 of us. Parking is available but it is an extra cost. Walking and Uber work best. Amit was very helpful and responded quickly to any questions.
5755168,226048094,2018-01-08,50594376,Evarist,Quite close to airport...walkable distance to a hypermarket...safe neighbourhood...great place for solo travellers.

27604757,511614624,2019-08-17,130490892,Emma,I had a wonderful stay at Tanya's place! The check-in was very straightforward and the place was extremely clean when I arrived. There were ample amenities available (ie. basic cleaning and kitchen supplies lots of towels blankets). The location is great about a 7 minute walk to College and Bathurst and 10 minutes to Toronto Western Hospital.
17559847,152032091,2017-05-14,39825417,Lotachi,Carlisle was a great host! He was very accessible and met my party and I at the condo. He was very helpful in getting us settled in and gave us a tour of the building and the amenities. The place was great and looked exactly like it did in the pictures. If I'm ever in the area I will be sure to stay again! 
29793192,431658165,2019-04-01,36346599,Lyzette,A nice quiet place.
21097739,435178916,2019-04-09,233509013,Natalie,Absolutely spectacular stay. The view is just breathtaking. Photos can’t capture it. Perfect space for us (2 adults and 2 kids 7 and 9). Easy check-in great location. Kal was super helpful... great communication. Lots of nice touches too( extra toiletries snacks coffee). We will definitely be back!

15788414,505728682,2019-08-09,235097585,Ana Regina Meneses E Silva,Mr. Chip and Mrs. Michelle are great host. They are pretty friendly and regardful. Chip’s House is located near stores bus station and streetcar.  Great to who want privacy and rest.
5479598,151162530,2017-05-11,59661145,Annabelle,Rui was a great host he responded almost immediately to our questions and offered to help us out when needed. The place itself was exactly like the photos provided. Basic necessities were provided. Great location close to central Toronto and plenty of shops near the area. Had a pleasure to stay at the suite.
29061984,460123101,2019-05-28,53097589,Paige,Loved Celeste's place! Great location beautifully styled apartment perfect size for one or two people. Celeste was so great with communication if and when I come back to Toronto I'll be staying there again.
35975252,566121283,2019-11-18,223909685,Isadora-Ayesha,TRÈS bien situé (le quartier est génial!!!) c'étais propre pour le prix de la chambre nous avons été comblé. Les lits ne sont pas très confortable par contre (surtout le lit simple je ne pense même pas qu'il s'agissait d'une matelas) mais pour deux nuits ça nous convenait.
13486027,194855084,2017-09-17,2844754,Judy,Geoff and Christine have a great apartment in a super neighbourhood. It was clean and they responded quickly to any questions. The kitchen and bathroom were fully equipped with supplies. We hope to return some day.
36464256,501494826,2019-08-03,12435836,Marek,Warte polecenia. Ze względu na lokalizację stosunek ceny do wartości jest niezwykle korzystny.
18430765,517689235,2019-08-25,84728505,Harry,It's a small apartment but very nice. It was perfectly clean when we arrived and the location is right next to a subway hub.
15056269,128307861,2017-01-23,21019076,Sohail,Nicely decorated room. Check in was slightly taxing as Ruhig wanted to personally meet at the time of the check-in. This at times makes harder to coordinate. Nonetheless we did meet and then went over the rules of the house and some cross-sell pitch as he also sells his wines. Overall tastefully decorated place and very clean. All things being excellent for the price point but would suggest him to change the mattress. 
27613500,483648069,2019-07-07,141729550,Duanyue,Amir is not a good but great host! We appreciate all he did for us! Nice clean stylish place. We're highly recommend him and his place. Easy and fast communicated Amir know what's you need and make everyone suitable and happiness.  Great host!
21667340,225845999,2018-01-07,133705993,Jessi,Overall ended up having a great time. Definitely would consider staying again however it would be more appealing if it was in a more welcoming location.
28281815,436677165,2019-04-13,88962867,Morgan,Cindy provided all of the information I needed for a smooth check-in despite a late-night flight. There were useful directions within the home and water by the bed which was greatly appreciated. I was able to walk to all of the places I was visiting during my trip from her location.
19623790,434761053,2019-04-08,218453239,Hélène,A lot of hospitality and kindness! Right in the centre of Toronto...
15549284,124327285,2017-01-01,107708970,Kevin,Sean is a great host who is friendly and willing to help out in any way possible. He gave us a lot of tips on how to get around the area what to eat and good local tips (ask about free parking around the city!). The location is a 20 minute drive from downtown but for the price you can't beat it. At first we were slightly afraid that the parking for the property would be difficult but it is exactly as he stated in the house rules and was accessible at all times (even during the holidays when we went). This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not have chosen a better host. 
7810199,188521545,2017-08-29,56513241,John,"Andrew and Clancy's place was great.  The perfect place to crash at the end of a long day of sightseeing in Toronto.  Clancy was awesome as she communicated with us on everything from check in to check out and even spent the time to show us around the building.  The apartment was in an awesome location super close to everything which was great.   

If I could make one recommendation it would be to add cable TV.   It was made clear in the description that TV was primarily  for movies.  I guess I did not realize that this meant that the TV would not get any cable television channels.  Just my 2 cents it certainly did not impact the quality of our stay as everything was great."
13496260,210859175,2017-11-11,109007809,Christine,Kei’s Place was perfect for our quick one night stay. Short walk to College St Bloor st and Kensington market. It’s clean and very comfortable. Kei always answered our messages quickly and made check in very very easy. A lovely stay and a great host!
7516848,413677775,2019-02-17,197357475,Sarina,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6196536,178047933,2017-08-04,28891265,Geena,Catherine was great and she let me check out later when my flight was delayed. Her home is beautiful and clean in a great location and she was very friendly and welcoming

20761475,498342954,2019-07-29,97606248,Pablo,Everything was perfect. The apartment was really beautiful and full of personality. The location is also very good to visit Toronto and the neighborhood is full of life. Great experience.
36464256,533411381,2019-09-21,137627583,Pat,Great location. Bedroom and bathroom clean and functional overall great value
5785794,205696305,2017-10-22,37178401,John,This was our first experience with Airbnb. Danny and Angela were wonderful hosts. They were attentive to our needs and made us feel welcome. We appreciated the small touches such as the chocolate bar left in our room. The bed was very comfortable. They were very helpful with advice and allowed us to leave our bags there as we had a late flight.
9608331,61506632,2016-02-05,38655756,Mitchell,"Roshi was a great host. She answered all my questions very promptly and was helpful in every regard. The place was very clean and looked exactly as it showed in pictures. I would definitely recommend this place for any Toronto traveller looking to stay near the entertainment and financial district.

12233086,97583335,2016-08-27,53756579,Heulwen,My sister and I stayed here for a month to find our feet after moving to Toronto. Alex & Sara were great hosts - very thoughtful and responsive even when they were away on their own vacation! They have some great tips for local restaurants and cafes which we can also recommend. We loved how close the apartment is to the subway station and you do get used to the sound of the subway going underneath the apartment very quickly. We made use of all the great amenities especially Apple TV. All in all Alex & Sara couldn't do enough to make sure we had a comfortable stay and we had a great time! 
18387545,522023790,2019-09-01,246781684,Ellie,We had a great stay. Amazing location as so close to everything we wanted to do. Joesph gave us loads of great recommendations and was really friendly. The apartment had a great bed and a good shower. Perfect for a few nights in Toronto!
6214704,457637837,2019-05-24,34250965,Ana,Our stay at Andrew’s place was phenomenal. The check-in was hassle free and convenient. The unit was clean and tidy overall a great space located in a fantastic spot in the city.
21612862,264251778,2018-05-13,24862369,Juan,"Amazing views! The unit sits on the top floor of a mid rise condo building. The key box is super convenient and access was effortless. The condo is modern and appointed with very nice IKEA type fixtures. The three roomates are busy young professionals so we had relatively minimal interaction but they are super kind and cool people. 

The area is full of hip food and retail shops too many to visit! The best restaurant in Toronto Alo is just across the street and Kensington Market is just a few short blocks away. Highly recommended!"
6170154,523432050,2019-09-03,246392085,Aaron,David’s space was great! Very close to the green line as well as a few restaurants. If you want to go see the city and have a very nice space to stay at look no further than this! Couldn’t be more satisfied with this space!
26364401,442014140,2019-04-22,195897443,Connie,On site parking and very close to a huge mall.
15713961,239158937,2018-02-28,142124966,Sara,Truly a great little oasis in the middle of bustling downtown Toronto. Lots of space and a great lay out for families (parents could still chat and socialize while the kids slept upstairs). It's an older building and the unit itself had a couple of small eccentricities (e.g. there's a special trick to closing the patio door) but overall a cozy well appointed place with everything you need to have a relaxing stay. Rebecca was an excellent host - came to meet us in person (upon request) showed us how things worked was just a text/call away. Highly recommend.
17620050,531481715,2019-09-17,85222690,Trent,Anita went above and beyond to help me when I arrived in Toronto. The bed was super comfortable. The location is an easy walk to the metro station so getting to the city was easy with public transport.
10521272,234692365,2018-02-13,71393719,Dave,My wife and I had a great stay with Laura.  She was attentive not invasive and supportive on an extra request.  Very pleasant host nicely appointed accomodations. We will revisit I’m sure.
10862232,67923318,2016-04-01,55403735,Igor,I had rented two times this apartment and very satisfied with a quality of room and hospitality of the owners. Bryn and Taylor were a good and polite host. I will not repeat what was already told by other guests before just only want to wish them the best guests and luck in their music career.
13849465,203200820,2017-10-14,32220727,Julie,Great spacious condo. Spectacular views from every window. Loved being so close to water and CN tower. Great host- and easy checkin with all instructions and great house manual.
23756166,303998068,2018-08-08,204553988,Nicholas,Awesome place to stay if you want to be downtown.

16721025,233693791,2018-02-10,6194837,Bill,Very comfortable space in a great location.  Janet was an extremely responsive host.  We stayed here for three weeks and were very satisfied with everything.  Would recommend it to anyone.
3329274,479837454,2019-07-01,20577983,Bradley,Erin's place was super charming - my partner and I loved it. Everything from the air conditioning to the front yard / garden made our time in Toronto super cozy and memorable. We loved being close to Bloor parks and the pool as well. Thank you Erin!
13909600,208686215,2017-11-02,18889054,Mark,"The place is very clean the location is great.  The key pickup is at a cafe that's about 10mins walk in the wrong direction from Union station.  It's not a bad walk assuming the weather is ok.  

A great deal vs the rates hotels charge in the area."
19317617,487932334,2019-07-14,234437626,Saeb,Clean comfortable and stylish. Has everything you need close to everything and a great value. Would highly recommend.
11221319,236583154,2018-02-19,22963348,Utkarsh,We had a very comfortable stay. The house was clean and well decorated in a quiet neighbourhood. Thanks for the stay.

14303663,276707439,2018-06-14,194805432,Subien,Max was great host. I just arrived there 10pm. But he was really kind. There dont have door. But The other people is really (Website hidden by Airbnb) it was fine. And it was quite far from subway. but you can take 94 bus. Thanks
787074,14046719,2014-06-10,8559626,David,We had a wonderful stay in Toronto. Tracy's appartment is very clean and nice to live in! We'll equipped kitchen and very nice view over the city from the balcony. I highly recommend this appartment and would go there again.
8473716,63143926,2016-02-20,12656566,Jay,I was very late to my reservation but Amy was very understanding and accommodating - she waited for me in the lobby and was very kind when she met me at the lobby.  The condo itself was sleek and tidy with good accommodations.  Would visit again!
3950747,360717228,2018-12-21,84994675,Michelle,We only stayed 2 nights but that was enough to fall in love with the place and Harry himself as a kind and very helpful host. We even got to taste his delicious oatmeal for breakfast he generously shared with us. Thank you for being an awesome host and guide for Toronto Harry! We'll be back. :)
21108818,216757751,2017-12-05,57231962,Céline,Tres bel appartement bien situé et Xiao Wei est très réactive et d'une très bonne aide !!! Je recommande !

23732461,272443095,2018-06-03,159137942,Eric,Had a great time staying at Darryl's place! His house was kept cool at all time and there were a lot of stores around to visit as well.
15798094,162851964,2017-06-22,25097801,Alexis,Very recommended! Very modern clean and flexible for check-in/check-out. 
18212525,261499696,2018-05-06,171033926,Ricardo,"If you looking for a place that close to Kensington market and etc Eaton center and CN Tower this is a good location but be aware it’s only a place to rest your head. 

The apartment is quite small it can House 3 people at most. The pull out couch bed is very firm. And some amenities  need to be checked over.    Not sure the price of other places in the area but I figured from the pictures the place was bigger but found it was not as large as it looks. It was probably the smallest apartment I’ve stayed in while in Toronto which I’ve been to 3 times in the last 8 months. Also there is steel staircase leading to each of the apartments. It’s not shown in pictures"
36879409,567452989,2019-11-22,179005820,Ann,"The flat at 1 Webster Ave in Toronto is in a really nice part of Toronto.  The access to everything is really good.  No complaints with the reservation process or with our communications with Spencer the host.
The bed in the bedroom is really comfortable and the apartment is functional with good wifi and security features.  
The flat needs a good cleaning when we arrived.  The kitchen was very disorganized with a n electric hot plate sitting  sitting on top of the stove that I assume was not working.  
The bathroom is small functional but small.  The pink tub has a working shower but the floor in the bathroom is significantly sloped and makes it awkward to move around.
If the basic issues can be addressed this is a nice place in a great location.  We did not use the outdoor space off the kitchen as it the weather in mid-November was not great for sitting outside but it is a nice space if the weather was better."
17639373,240386097,2018-03-04,174005029,Nicole,"Excellent location & terrific hospitality Mark accomodated my student budget and was very responsive to all my questions!
Would stay again 5/5"
18979719,555991841,2019-10-28,83957403,Kerri,Close to where I needed to be and saved me $$. Door to room does not lock sliding door only. Building is older. Host is kind and quick to attend to needs.
32835782,460995456,2019-05-30,39877914,Kirsty,Suzanna was a gracious and amazing host! She made sure I had everything I needed and was lovely to meet. The space is very stylish and clean with tons of space towels etc etc. i really enjoyed my 8 days here and especially chilling on the spacious patio and watching the sun rise and set. Thanks again :)
39725474,567856276,2019-11-23,87263268,Victoria,Excellent location and great price. Always quick to respond. Will use again. Thank you

Any questions I had Kevin would respond instantly and even checked in to make sure I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again.

4540126,193699854,2017-09-14,74660287,Ania,I had a wonderful stay in this apartment. It is spacious light and has all that you need for a few days or even weeks (I stayed for almost three weeks). The building is a bit older which you can see in the apartment as well I mostly noticed that the walls are quite thin meaning that you can hear all that Goes on around your unit.

15204934,504938529,2019-08-08,62880544,Brendon,My 2nd stay at Grace's place after one in 2018. That should speak for itself. As usual she makes guests feel right at home and often leaves her cooking upstairs for us. Nice quite central location 10m walk to the metro and train stations makes it especially good value for money quiet neighbourhood with plenty of eating options and supermarkets close by.
17184710,345151241,2018-11-04,90301806,Chloé,The entrance is really convenient we saw the owners once they were kind and listening.
18070830,183216712,2017-08-16,120121729,Kari,This is a lovely house the outside is especially nice to be able to sit around a large table and there is a very nice water fountain in the garden which we sat around at night.  The host left an extremely generous welcome package which was much appreciated as we arrived very late at night.  We could not fault the house or the location and wish we could have stayed for longer.

29490606,508222970,2019-08-12,246381568,Dwight,I stayed here for Summerslam Weekend 2019. Shawn’s a great guy who will stay in communication with you throughout your stay. Will make adjustments with you if requested. It literally is just a few steps away from the subway. There are lots of restaurants and grocery stores near the place. In conclusion I was very pleased with my stay at Shawn’s place.

The apartment was clean & bright with plenty of space and privacy.  I had a fun but frustratingly short first visit to Toronto squeezed between family visits in the region.  I highly recommend Jennifer's apartment and hope to return for a longer stay before too long.

18941038,510116926,2019-08-15,27618233,James,"I recently stayed at Aaria and I was very displeased.   The carpets were disgusting the blinds were broken and stained the couch was beat up the bathroom had paint peeling away over the sink the ""Toiletries"" included one large shared bottle of basic shampoo and importantly my sheets were dirty upon arrival and had hair in it from the previous guest.     

To the staff's credit when I alerted management the next day they were kind enough to go and change the sheets which I do appreciate.     They did offer to change my unit but I was offsite and could not facilitate a change and the trip was short so I took the clean sheets and called it a learning experience.   I contacted management after leaving before writing this review and did not hear back.   Perhaps I just got a bad unit but it was far from what I expected.  Will not stay again."

7770469,141740079,2017-04-04,4169684,Sarah,it is directly downtown and very close to the main streets and street cars. (Hidden by Airbnb) the info because there is none in the apt. there is also construction on a high rise right across the street so you will NOT sleep in as they started very early before 7a.every day..this is not their fault but it will probably go on for some time!  the door does not open with the key on the first two tries so use the electronic if you have wifi outside the apt.(once you step out if you are not from canada you have to use data roaming as it is shut off once you leave!! ) its very hot at night so crack the sliding glass door. i would also download the app indie (Website hidden by Airbnb) tells some great places locals suggest!!! the apt was downtown and location was great!! for the money it was great too..they also answered emails immediately. if you use more than one towel each..bring more. there is a quickette on the corner for waters snacks etc but a big grocery is a few blocks away. 
11184179,132540619,2017-02-18,85139823,Angela,Nice quiet location very close to the bus route to go straight downtown. Great stay and made accommodations for arrival times. Was exactly as seen in the pictures

This was our family's first visit to Toronto and we were able to walk across the street to check out the Rogers Center the CN Tower Ripley's Aquarium and part of the Harbour front! You are within minutes of other places like the Royal Ontario Museum Eaton Centre and Chinatown! We cannot recommend a better location for anyone visiting Toronto for the first time. The unit also comes with a free parking spot for those traveling with a car! This was our first Airbnb experience and it was the best way to kick it off! The bar has been set high!!!

2684516,301643040,2018-08-04,174731659,Avantika,I stayed at Andrew’s home while taking a summer course at the University of Toronto and I would highly recommend it! My room was clean comfortable and beautifully and thoughtfully decorated. The home is lovely with a very nice kitchen living room and patio on the ground floor. The location is quiet and residential and walking distance (20 min) from downtown. Most importantly Andrew is a friendly and thoughtful host who is deeply passionate about the city and neighborhood and will do anything to make sure your stay is as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. It was a pleasure to get to know Andrew and the other guests who stayed in his place over the summer and he has plenty of tips on what to do and see in Toronto and the area. At the end of my stay Andrew cooked a beautiful and delicious homemade meal. I would definitely recommend staying at Andrew’s place especially if you are planning a longer-term visit to Toronto!

Check in and check out was easy breezy. Place was clean and bed was comfortable.
12542966,166103666,2017-07-02,1388764,Cathi,Aeriol's home is lovely and inviting. Full of light and beautiful art. The bedroom suite is spacious and comfy.

13922450,464000969,2019-06-04,2487928,Maya,Tam and Gwen's place was true to its description and even more lovely than it appears on the images. The apartment is super well located for shopping restaurants gallery hopping etc. There are great breakfast spots in short walking distance and it's really easy to get around by public transit from their place as well. We particularly appreciated all the little touches like snacks coffee tea. The kitchen has all you need to prepare a meal as well a real meal as in salad spinner cutting boards a proper knife.  Everything is easy to figure out and find in the apartment. There's space for your clothes and toiletries which is always appreciated. It's  a place that has all the touches to make you feel at home while being not cluttered. To be honest I don't often give 5 stars but this experience was really perfect in every aspect.

Die sehr große Wohnung in einem luxoriösem Hochhaus bietet alles was man für den Aufenthalt braucht hat einen grandiosen Ausblick und liegt nur ein paar Schritte von der U-Bahn-Station entfernt.

14317572,179456336,2017-08-07,1907614,Cedric,This is a great property that you can be downtown in a car within minutes without using an expressway.  The listing accurately represented the home. There is plenty of space -- you can fellowship on the porch in the living room around the kitchen island or in the backyard. The home has everything you need on a trip away from your own home. Mark & Laura made sure that our stay was above expectation. The neighborhood has a lot of character and the home is one a quiet street. We are regular visitors to Toronto and definitely would stay here again.

We will definitely stay there again next time hopefully for more nights.

7834160,152218868,2017-05-15,56057232,Keith,This was an amazing place to stay in Toronto! Great location close to bars and restaurants but still a quiet neighborhood that felt safe.  The actual apartment was perfect with a entry code for the lock instead of a key which was very convenient. The parking garage spot also worked out great and was easy to get in and out of.  As for the actual apartment everything was super clean the bed was very comfortable and Rick and Judy had stocked it with everything you might have forgotten (toothbrushes shampoo etc.)! Rick and Judy were amazing hosts. They had a printed out map of the neighborhood with all of their favorite spots and were quick to respond with any questions. I would definitely stay here again for another trip to Toronto.
22278502,491047153,2019-07-19,185678311,Yuka,Luis is very kind and friendly. Explain about the rooms well and give back quick response. The room and bathroom is stylish and comfortable. I will definitely come back if I come back to Toronto.

28543893,514069020,2019-08-20,245357379,Ole,One of the best Airbnb on our trip through US and Canada. Great location in the heart of Toronto great condo equiped with everything you need and great view!
18636779,199301567,2017-10-01,68990661,Natasha,Great place with an amazing view. The hosts were super sweet and we're always quick to help.
34778962,474859657,2019-06-23,63977842,Rachel,I had a great time staying here. Walkable to Finch Station and lots of restaurant/shopping options. The space is huge and versatile I would absolutely live here full-time if given the chance. Peter was a great host super accommodating when I found myself coming in late. No keys to the room or house are provided but I never felt unsafe staying here. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks so much!
5085586,502450068,2019-08-04,265509781,Serena,"RAT! RAT! RAT! RAT! RAT! RAT! 
Please do yourself a favour and book another place! 
We were supposed to be in the house for a month and we end it up staying for just 3 nights.. wondering why? WE FOUND A RAT among spiders and moths (and yes! I used the plural)! We immediately advise the host about the rat and the answer was “it is normal to find mice in an old house like this” Luis added mouse traps around the house and he left. When we found rat droppings (you can get diseases and in worse case scenario you can die from) in the shower we decided to call Airbnb! They offered us a refund and to help us find another place to stay but it was not very helpful because the other listing were above (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) $ which is not was we could afford and mostly because  they were not able to find a solution before the night (and we had nowhere to go) so WE WERE FORCED TO SLEEP IN THE HOUSE putting our heath in danger! Due to the complicated situation we offered the hosts to call a professional to CLEAN the house (which i think is what you must do when you find mice in your place) and cover the expenses for the hotel for us to stay until the place was safe - any hotel would have been fine for us but they REFUSED OUR OFFER! 
So we were forced  to find another place to stay (and not with the airbnb help) and our first days of vacation were ruined by the poor hygiene of two adults. 
Also the laundry room which is not shown in the pictures posted smells like urine. DISGUSTING! 

Only good thing about the listing is that it is close to the transits but is it worth it? I do not think so. 
If you decide to book this place GOOD LUCK and i hope you have a very good heath insurance."
27980327,479828692,2019-07-01,269804032,Bianca,This is a very beautiful place to stay. Sleeps lots of people the space was used very well. Definitely would recommend for a couple nights stay if you’re planning an event downtown.
24091343,304507908,2018-08-09,191060659,Yannick,Well located for my needs. Clean and quiet place. Laura's quick replies (within seconds) to questions or requests was really appreciated. 
14330267,251703540,2018-04-08,117819737,Victoria,This place was amazing! Fantastic view beautifully decorated place clean and awesome location. The hosts are great and there was no issues at all! I would definitely stay here again!
13435785,522658409,2019-09-02,220978484,Brian,Very good value short uber or metro ride away from downtown. Voke was extremely helpful and accommodating with any question I had.
19031858,179868321,2017-08-08,6414593,Mike,This is a great place to stay in the best neighborhood in Toronto. Meaghan made the whole process as easy as possible.  We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Toronto.

22410436,245289947,2018-03-21,170615406,Ashley,It was an okay experience.  Good place to sleep but not much more.  The balcony was nice.  The host was super helpful when the cable wasn't working after I tried to fix it he came back to help me.
27503620,426622523,2019-03-21,173847434,Cj,Great place. Quick response. No issues. Would definitely recommend.
3947070,93117800,2016-08-11,88383878,Michael,The location was incredible not only was it super close to the subway but the area itself has plenty things to do around the area the place is very tidy and well kept! Also it being a private room great you feel alot more comfortable I'd say. Overall amazing experience and quality airbnb
14422995,96036126,2016-08-21,29422491,Yanis,We were staying in the 3rd floor bedroom for two nights in August 2016. Even arriving quite late has not been a problem. Valerie took care that we felt welcome and that we were all set for our two days in Toronto. The location is absolutely terrific with just a few steps to the beach going south and being on Queens Street going north. Getting there from the airport is no problem at all by just taking the cable car. Would recommend to stay.
28785762,341348214,2018-10-26,217289842,Jeremy,"Dylan answered my questions very quickly. He also made sure that i got access to the condo despite the fact I arrived very early (6AM)!
The instructions were very clear.
From the building you have direct access to the PATH which is extremely useful in winter or when it is cold and when you want to get to union station under 10 minutes. You are also very close to the CN Tower and other Toronto touristic locations
The view from the condo is amazing too!
Thanks to Dylan and his wonderfull condo my first AirBnB experience was awesome!"

14616098,522032216,2019-09-01,85958901,Yovan,William is a wonderful host. Extremely nice and considerate. He responds clearly and quickly to messages. The apartment was great; very clean. It had everything I needed: dishes utensils pots and pans salt/pepper/spices/oil refrigerator coffee maker microwave etc. The apartment is really well located: near Church St but also near a nice 24h grocery store (2 min. walk). The bed was comfortable and the apartment was quiet when I wanted to sleep late. If I go back to Toronto I’ll definitely want to book William’s place again. Thank you!
18518988,334321636,2018-10-08,214989836,Steven,As shown... relatively close to downtown
33272324,496494689,2019-07-27,260253111,Allison,Great location in the city and easy access to public transit! Easy check in process and quick response times. The only fault we would give this location is that the apartment wasn’t overly sound proof. Other than that a great stay!
12080044,231292916,2018-01-31,158084102,Yurika,I enjoyed staying her place. I thought my room was noisy at the beginning of my stay here because my room is next to the major road so I could not sleep first couple of days but after I used ear plugs the problem was solved and eventually I got used to the noise without earplugs as well. My room was kind of dark but Borana could make it brighter afterwards. She is a very social and nice person and if any issues occurred she could solve quickly. I would love to stay here again if I had an opportunity. Room is retro and cute. I can definitely recommend people to stay here. Thank you Borana for all the experiences here. :)
5690179,260354480,2018-05-04,181003438,Shahriar,Clean well maintained conveniently located ( TTC - Subway is max 5 min walk) and nice neighbourhood. Ivan and Karen are very fast in responding friendly and a easy going people. Living room is the place where you can relax and be friendly with other guests.
23625662,270873055,2018-05-30,159542611,나현,친절하시고 필요한 정보 물어보면 다 알려주셨어요! 숙소도 깔끔하고 주변도 조용해서 편했어요!
15589849,157308738,2017-06-03,35310704,Gemma,Excellent apartment great facilities and ideal location. Hassle free check-in and check-out. Would definitely recommend. 
21138147,297292049,2018-07-27,13517254,Fred,They were extremely communicative and accommodating for all check-in and out requests. They also were understanding and helpful for anything I needed. The space was clean and very enjoyableand I would recommend this to anybody. Hope to stay here again. 
22769509,345088020,2018-11-04,189718731,Gilles,Our experience in Toronto was greatly improved by Ginger and Eleanor’s thoughtful recommendations and beautiful space. Big thanks!
20227535,259764452,2018-05-02,164676221,Tenji,Convenient location. Clean secure building. Close to mall and restaurants (no grocer nearby though). Nice couple.
7774544,507380320,2019-08-11,266605330,Michael,"Exactly as advertised. 

No surprises which was a good thing!"
4126210,50132027,2015-10-09,44336053,Jessica,Leo's place was perfect for a couple and single person alike. It was clean and literally on the water. The picture is the view outside of the balcony. He was super welcoming when we got to the condo and explained everything fully. He even invited us to spend sometime on his boat! Sadly the weather stopped that but still an amazing gesture.  The condo had all the necessities and felt completely safe getting around the neighbourhood and in the building. Next time i'm in Toronto I know to look him up!
15699861,157708225,2017-06-04,5848442,Carol,Lovely stay in a really cute wee flat - I loved the kitsch decor and the back deck. I also really liked the local shops and area - found a great book shop just round the corner. Rolyn was a nice guy and gave me just enough info to make my stay enjoyable.
32724418,468057086,2019-06-11,83916353,Suzanne,"This is a very sleek and comfortable room in downtown Toronto. Bed was great and was very clean with pretty decor.  

I would say as a solo female traveller I was quite nervous coming home at night at that particular corner (lots of unsavoury characters hanging around).  In daylight it was fine. But keep that in mind. Also I did not read the ad properly and there was no TV which was a bit annoying (but that's on me for not reading the ad).  

All in all it was what I needed. Thank you!!"
3052325,220964981,2017-12-24,139476814,Lennard,Cheap place with lots of restaurants nearby. Great for students.
18681182,506450661,2019-08-10,84274115,Nicole,Joanne’s place is exactly as pictured. It is a very stylish space. It is also a great location if you are going into downtown Toronto. It is also within walking distance of several restaurants and grocery stores.
15450150,109874537,2016-10-23,2799604,Jen,Listing was as described.  Very comfortable place to stop over for a night!

19751570,269606959,2018-05-27,169371205,Brittany,The place is lovely!  Very clean amenities are wonderful I had a good time.  Also the pillows are squishy :)
34777846,518936158,2019-08-27,243228766,George-Mary,Very nice locationfor a decent price!
10412695,145204647,2017-04-17,110959861,Cole,One word. Amazing! We picked up the key from downstairs at the pub and it came with a personalized card and gift card to the pub! When we got upstairs everything looked exactly like the pictures. I loved the view the artwork and the convenience it was to everything. We decided to stay in Toronto an extra day but sadly the apartment was booked. Will be visiting Toronto more frequently and would stay here again! Thanks for the amazing job Keir! 
20257089,551732838,2019-10-20,131926130,Daniel,Jackie and Shan were lovely hosts. They were extremely accommodating and great at communicating. The apartment was cozy and as described. Would stay here any time.

24034669,342281191,2018-10-28,18547119,Toni,We spent a long weekend at Amir’s place.  Our daughter had an appointment to tour the University of Toronto.  The townhouse was very clean and was newly decorated.  The subway station was a 10-15 minute walk.  We didn’t really have time to cook but if we did the kitchen was stocked with all the necessary equipment.  It was a cold and rainy weekend and the place was warm and cozy.
25288689,350593049,2018-11-19,114675967,Suzune,すごくｵｼｬﾚで素敵な空間でした!地下鉄の駅からはやや遠いいものの､ﾊﾞｽ停からはかなり近いです｡ﾎｽﾄの方も何かあった際にはすぐ対応してくれました｡
28391745,406716117,2019-01-30,238903449,Margo,Jessica my host was amazing. Answered questions in seconds. Would always stay with her   - never in a hotel. I saved so much time got work done. Quiet and safe building. Room was spotless.
28138650,426568211,2019-03-21,46311409,Jessica,Clean great location and helpful instructions for check in/out and parking!
9857301,137303104,2017-03-14,3859021,Genevieve,This is a cozy little place in a central part of Toronto. Everything was expected except some basic kitchen amenities were missing. I would have loved to find trash bags dishwasher tablets and laundry soap in the flat-- I had to buy extra and that wasn't convenient on a short work trip. The place is bright and has a great patio for BBQs in the spring summer. The kitchen is pretty basic and not well equipped for cooking.  Otherwise everything was great and as expected!
25842884,346402204,2018-11-08,38019943,Justin,Brittany’s place was easy to check-in to it was clean and close to everything that you need. I would definitely stay here again.
30960153,514155416,2019-08-20,132653157,Noelia,"Es un apartamento estupendo en el piso 27 con unas vistas geniales a la ciudad. Está a unos 7minutos andando de Dundas square donde hay metro y es el centro de la ciudad muy bien ubicado.
Super limpio con buen gusto y muchos detalles como una cesta con chocolates y patatas. 
Hay champú y gel y nos dejó unos cepillos de dientes y pasta. 
Las toallas estaban impecables y buena olor. 
Aunque es su casa ella no apareció por allí en los cuatro días dándonos absoluta privacidad. 
La cocina es completa y se puede utilizar. 
Tiene una TV muy grande donde poder usar Netflix.
RECOMENDADO AL 100X100!!"

28412732,556826904,2019-10-30,5250062,Julian,Everything was perfect nice views from the appartment comfortable beds and easy self check in. Would stay here again!
12605832,264391547,2018-05-13,175351180,MarcoLyne,We had the opportunity to stay at this Airbnb for the weekend. Much better cheaper and convenient for 5 girls to enjoy a great weekend! (2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms)! Really enjoyed our stay! Being my first experience with Airbnb Ashley was always available to answer my calls and my emails. Will definitely go back!!
27136994,425944062,2019-03-19,34004684,Asa,Maya was an excellent host. Self check-in was easy. Instructions were clear. And the place was very clean. I have no complaints and would definitely rent again if I am ever in the area.
20902125,340970718,2018-10-25,207604050,Ana,Great location and super clean! Definitely recommend.
24225998,285422128,2018-07-03,198921678,Aleksandr,Our stay was amazing here! Very clean condo. The views from the 22nd floor was amazing. William was a great guy to deal with. He helped us out big time with the parking situation since we had 2 cars. The location was great with a Starbucks right below us. We really enjoyed the rooftop pool which you could see the CN tower right in front of you as you tan  swim. Security is pretty tight but as long as you are respectful to them then they will be respectful to you. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you William !
29462421,521960648,2019-09-01,201412565,Alexandre,Un accueil chaleureux pleins de petites attentions. Un endroit très calme près de la plage  des boutiques et des restos sympas. A proximité de tout pleins d'activités.
11121115,146099041,2017-04-21,82539131,Caio,The house is great! Totally loaded with everything that you need: comfy large beds on both rooms very nice kitchen and all the stuffs to host 4 adults comfortably. The house is also very well located near to street cars buses grocery stores and even if you need a parking spot there is a Municipal Parking 1 min walk away. Furthermore me and my guests had the pleasure to meet Jessica. She is a great host very kind and attentive. She is always available to either answer or help you with whatever you need. We had great 15 days staying in Jessica's place. We definitely recommend her place if you want to spend some time in Toronto.
14222776,413466428,2019-02-17,46454037,Karah,This location made our trip so fun and easy. Loved not having to drive much as we could walk to so many main attractions. Only mishap was that the fire alarm was pulled in the middle of the night which was not the condo's fault. Would 100% come back!
17159524,148262207,2017-04-30,38690253,Thom,Fantastic place love the yard the bbq the piano. Very relaxing but close to great shops and restaurants. Would def recommend the place great office for business travellers as well.

20518703,238335427,2018-02-25,168029908,Amanda,Gorgeous building.  Gorgeous space.  Amazing views and an amazing host.  I could not ask for anything more.  The amenities (gym hot tub pool sauna) ended up being the cherry on top.  I will definitely be staying here again.
15790385,185774201,2017-08-22,6888154,Natalie,Kaymar's place had everything we needed. It was beautiful and the location couldn't have been better. Close to an amazing italian restaurant Nervosa! Check it out. Thanks Kaymar for everything we really enjoyed our time there and hope to be back.
4687194,47294531,2015-09-17,3285895,Chris,Beautiful home with easy driving access to freeway and surrounding stores.  Really enjoyed the patio. Although we missed actually meeting Don he provided necessary info for entry via phone. Don responded promptly to our inquiry regarding a fuse issue and all was resolved.
32381744,435457219,2019-04-10,244962527,Robert,Fantastic apartment I really enjoyed my ten night stay. Great location and really easy to reach other locations in Toronto. I would highly recommend this apartment!
13075056,246016285,2018-03-24,2670707,Kathryn,Laura and Sol couldn't have been more accommodating. From the thoughtful touches of a light-up board with our names on it slippers and pastries to the exceptional cleanliness and wonderful location in a quiet neighborhood just steps from the hustle and bustle of Queen St. made for a wonderful weekend getaway to a magical city.
16846122,320950598,2018-09-09,209416651,Jatin,Good service and clean place. Quick reply and quick problem solving. Everything made available to guests.

If we come to Toronto next time we will still choose here to stay. "
122492,14446477,2014-06-19,16151744,Cody,Brett was a really great host. Very accommodating. We were able to check in early and ended up staying an extra night. When I asked about using the BBQ in the yard he kindly replaced the propane tank that afternoon so we could have a wonderful BBQ dinner. The unit is well contained. I only heard one footstep from upstairs the entire stay. The neighborhood is really beautiful. 20 minute walk to the subway. We enjoyed gorgeous walking trails nearby. I think the only downfall to this unit is there are no temperature controls in the suite for the air conditioning so some evenings were quite hot with the humidity. Regardless we really enjoyed our short and sweet trip to Toronto and would definitely stay with Brett again.

1038085,50395208,2015-10-11,6881846,Jon,Amazing stay in Toronto great location and very welcoming hosts.  I really enjoyed my time and I would recommend to anyone.
24350432,255216049,2018-04-19,184132209,Sergio,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Merci encore pour tout et j’espère vous revoir peut être une autre fois à Toronto ! Je précise que tout est conforme aux photos et avis! Je recommande ++++
19473823,528155249,2019-09-12,58178195,David,Cannot beat the value and location. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. Branko is a thoughtful and accommodating host.
28033460,481328802,2019-07-04,2896025,Erica,The location is great! We were able to get to all the great spots we wanted to visit with just a short drive. We appreciated the parking behind the house so it was off the street. The property had almost everything we needed to prepare meals in the apartment only missed a toaster but we just used the oven no problem. Dave was great about checking in and making sure we had everything we needed and was very quick responding. The only (small) issue we had was that it was pretty chilly inside the apartment so we would have liked to have had extra blankets but if you pack some sweatpants and a hoodie you should be comfortable for lounging without a blanket. We had a great time and this property suited our needs perfectly!
25807559,412819377,2019-02-16,69391706,Olivier,Photos are conform to the appartment. The location is great and Robyn is a very nice host.

Maja even let me stay a little while after check out which I really appreciate. 
The apartment itself was really nice and was spacious. Everything was clean and basically I didn't see anything wrong at all. Would 100% come back to this apartment."

1100282,183556808,2017-08-17,141420887,Cristina,Sun's house is extremely welcoming and clean. The location is great! There is so much to do within walking distance. We had a great time in Toronto and Sun's house made us feel at home and very comfortable. Having access to a full kitchen was so nice! We cooked ourselves a little breakfast every morning and sat around the cozy dining room table. In the evenings we opened the windows and relaxed in the living area playing board games. Sun even took the time to add little mints and snacks in each room which was a cute idea! I highly recommend booking with her if you're planning on visiting Toronto! Sun provided an experience that is better than staying in a hotel!
20761475,477572044,2019-06-28,268653141,Cami,Overall it was a good stay. Sarah provided the code to get in and it worked perfectly so check in was a breeze. Parking was also easy. The space is 1 apartment in an old building/house and it was really cute and had a lot of character with the exposed ceiling beams and white brick wall. The private balcony was tiny but the shared one was nice to use. There were a few small details that were clearly not paid attention to like the massive soap jug instead of a proper dispenser and the shower was not good. Over all a cute space but some of the rugs were a little dirty. Couches were pretty bad to sit on but we only had 6 people so I’m not sure how they would be to sleep. But it was perfect for what we needed since we were just staying the 1 night. Sarah was responsive but they all seemed like automated responses which was kinda annoying. I would stay here again but I wouldn’t stay here if I wanted a “luxury” vacation type place.
6357730,117223293,2016-12-05,39483135,Keer,Everything is good. The transportation is really convenient. It's every great at all.

8183277,89876407,2016-07-30,85365582,Peter,We stayed about a week and enjoyed the nice appartment in great location for discovering Downtown Toronto. Brenda was easy to get in contact and provided help whenever there were questions. Next time we'd like to stay at her place again.
8921021,80603729,2016-06-19,68585810,Shaan,Great host with a very clean and organized apartment. Easy to get in touch with. Couldn't have asked for more. If you make sure to follow the house rules everything will go smoothly. 
29818261,434824854,2019-04-08,43431595,Mandeep,The stay at Daniel and Ann's place was amazing! The house was impeccably clean and had all the amenities that were listed. It's located opposite to an amazing cafe called Lady Marmalade do try it! We had a nice stay since there wasn't any noise around the house and we could get our work done. The hosts were very responsive!
1289926,523446778,2019-09-03,99596275,Arnar,"Flawless stay. It has everything you need we spent 5 days in Toronto and it was perfect. If you are looking for a relaxing place this is it. Hands down best Airbnb we have been to.
Thanks Dionne!!"

31758842,550430923,2019-10-18,31939066,광영,Lodging is as clean and convenient as a picture. However the place of appointment is ambiguous when I visit. Address is not home but office can help you check in.
16533020,488858883,2019-07-15,48297925,Lisa,Galina is a great host we had a very good night in her house. It is very tidy and spacious strong recommended.

24756881,279440423,2018-06-20,35263540,Mo,I experienced one of my best stay with Airbnb at Hadis house. The place is quiet clean and cozy. Close to public transport with less than 3 min to subway. Near bayview village with big grocery store. Surely recommend to any one who wants to enjoy Toronto.
1510402,324679714,2018-09-17,19672361,Xue Qu,The house was perfect it’s a lovely experience to actually stay in someone’s house and you don’t get that often in Airbnb nowadays. Everything’s provided and the room was brighten and spacious. However due to the fact that Graeme was not commucative at all to my messages (even the short thank-you note after checking out which was rude) my check-in experience was very uncomfortable. His wife treated me like a school girl. I felt very offended. Can’t really say I enjoyed the experience.
17793499,559645939,2019-11-04,214512984,Alex,Alex is a great host who has a beautiful home!

21579122,332522912,2018-10-05,4802608,Zoë,View and great location is great host is very communicative and booked us when another service cancelled last minute.  Unit itself is very bare bones bring your own toiletries and snacks.  Bed isn't the most comfortable but is a convenient place to sleep super close to ACC Rogers CN Tower Union etc.  Blinds could be a bit thicker as the unit faces East and had a ton of windows if you're planning on sleeping in or are jetlagged bring an eye mask
3021915,31404394,2015-05-04,280358,Sharon,Thank you Nicole and Imran for a wonderful stay! The apartment was spotless and beautifully decorated and easy to relax in. Imran was in touch from beginning to end of the whole process which I very much appreciated. Thank you especially for setting out a coffee and tea service which made it easy to wake up :-) ! I would stay here again without hesitation!

260645,21146443,2014-10-12,20827750,Christopher,This is a nice and enjoyable experience staying at Linda's space. The place is clean and cozy. And its location is very convenient to travel by public transportation since it's located in the heart of Toronto. Even parking is convenient Linda is so thoughtful that she has already prepared instructions on how to temporary park our car in the neighbourhood. My family and I stayed in Toronto for a week. Linda kindly gave us suggestions on our trip. We enjoyed our stay and I would recommend this place to family travellers.
36634383,569351188,2019-11-26,250046974,志,住在这里感觉非常棒!房东非常热情友好!主动介绍房子的一切使用方法｡干净卫生房间安静洗漱洗衣服都非常的好!位置好找离机场半小时｡所以非常推荐大家来Janet家住!
7280853,446003783,2019-04-30,2021640,Lina,This is not what I expected.  This place is not for female traveler who are looking to enjoy Toronto and check out the night life.  The odor of the room is horrible No mirror the bathroom is upstairs and you have to go through dark staircases.  No hand soap the lock on the main door has a tape on the back and wires are hanging from the out side of the house. The steps leading to the house is not complete.  I feel uncomfortable.  Maybe is suitable for male traveler.
28391745,338447206,2018-10-19,78635664,Julien,The bed is across the entry door so kind of noisy at night.
31652227,473361796,2019-06-21,118956549,Marina,"Su mujer fue muy atenta al darnos la bienvenida. La ""habitación"" tenia para hacerte té y agua. Pero en realidad era un sotano con mucho ruido y frio. 
Estoy desconforme porque llegué justa al aeropuerto y me cobró como si no hubiese pasado nada."
7932941,59550602,2016-01-11,53750009,Ian,Amazing experience with this one! The room surpassed my expectations. It was as described in the descriptions and pictures and more! The washroom was very clean and organized as well as the kitchen. The host Frederic himself was very inquiring and at the same time professionally gave us privacy. Location was also good with access to parking in the neighborhood. This was my first experience with AirBnb and it was very pleasant. Made my weekend stay in Toronto memorable! Will definitely utilize AirBnb again for my next travel plans. Thank you Frederic!
22282909,340635621,2018-10-24,187659689,Khyla,place matched exactly with the description !

11068703,65442360,2016-03-13,24128342,Jeff,It was a big shift to come from rural Nova Scotia to this 42nd floor apartment in city centre. Great place and amazing location right next to Union Station and Air Canada Centre. It was perfect and communication with Akshay was timely and clear. Highly recommend !
19826911,271228707,2018-05-31,71571940,Ellen,My husband and i were in Toronto for business and pleasure in June. The flat was as pictired beautiful views and very clean.  This was the perfect location for our needs. We used to live in the GTA and if you are visiting Toronto as a tourist this is the perfect place as it is within walking diatance to the waterfront theatre restaurants the island airport transportation and shopping. Thanks Chad!
17526661,232644514,2018-02-05,165961023,Bruno,"The room is well-kept and clean and the location is really good being very close to a subway station and many shops and restaurants. The hosts are quick to respond to any questions you may have.

The room also has a really good internet connection which was a really pleasant surprise given my previous experiences in hotels (this was my first time using AirBNB) so even if you need to stay indoors for some reason you can still enjoy your stay.

If you want to visit Toronto I highly recommend this room."
18093416,198772057,2017-09-30,141750853,Madjid,Très content de mon séjour chez cette famille. Danilo et sa famille sont très accueillants très gentils. Je recommande !!!

13740019,239906009,2018-03-03,173319628,Sebas,"Staying at Bill's was fantastic. He is a very open warm and talkative guy with interesting points of view on the world.

The room vast very nice with a neat bathroom (with one of those huge waterfall showers) and a bed and desk and couch. The area is really nice only a few minutes away from grocery store Loblaws and Broadview station which will bring you everywhere. 

You will not be bored staying at Bill's believe me on that. And Bill has been really helpful with random stuff like letting me use his washing machine and fixing a parking permit. 

Absolute recommendation!"
14933789,120323354,2016-12-09,90457048,Mariah,Qun was eager to help in whichever way he could . He offered every time we saw him to let him know if there's anything we need . He took an extra step and ordered and printed a parking pass for us so that we wouldn't have any troubles for overnight parking on the street. Overall we were very pleased with our experience . The room was very clean and comfortable.

35791291,521150611,2019-08-31,81617539,Quoc Tien,Great stay! The place is as described in the pictures. The view on the city is amazing. The king size bed very comfy. Great Appartement for 4 people or less. The parking is free which is great in downtown Toronto. It's a bit confusing to find the parking spot but the videos helped a lot. Very well located. The hosts are responsive. I recommend this place!

21275774,220685678,2017-12-23,45341669,Madina,We stayed at Bryce’s place three times during  one trip to Canada so you may see my reviews three times as AirBnB asks to rate your experience each time you book. Having stayed three times during one holiday must speak volumes for how fantastic our experience was!:)   We first arrived as a large family to Toronto during busy pre-Christmas time (Dec. 19-23) . The hosts immediately made us feel like we were home and the check-in was very smooth. There was an ample space for the 5 of us (3 adult kids plus Mom&Dad) the house is cosy well-designed and renovated. The kitchen has everything you need should you decide to cook (although we only ate in once because there were so many fabulous restaurants right next door!)  We loved our stay so much that we asked the hosts if we can come back 5 days after (we were traveling across Canada: TO-Montreal-Ottawa and back to TO). I was so glad the place was available!  Thank you Bryce and Miguel for taking such a good care of us!  Until next time! 
15256925,123752121,2016-12-30,96480653,Maggie,The place is very comfy and convenient. It's better than a hotel if you stay for a long period. Min and AJ are nice hosts. I was locked out two times because of my carelessness and every time they came to help me out immediately.
24396723,257838650,2018-04-27,15573691,Kate,"Maureen's AirBnB is in a perfect location in the city. It's close to the subway but far enough away from any real noise from the city. She's right about the birds but they aren't horribly noisy just nice to wake up to!  The place itself is old but very well-maintakned and charming. The room is large enough and has a desk.  The bed is the shining star.  I had such a magnificent sleep!

Thanks for everything Maureen.  Will definitely book again if I find myself in need in Toronto!"
28669395,420727148,2019-03-07,133951634,Emmanuel,Lits très propres procedure d'arrivée très simple. Logement conforme aux photos. Très bon rapport qualité-prix
19591910,299267569,2018-07-30,23958419,Dougy,The place is as-described and it is a quirky little place with a nice balcony for chilling inside or out. The parking situation is tricky so don't plan on having an easy time with this. Host communication could've been better.
38324047,553579618,2019-10-24,223799962,Marco,was like we expected. everithing was clean and the bed is super comfortable!
2817835,489908595,2019-07-17,177241029,Robert,Nice spot in the heart of Toronto. Easy to get place along with free parking (which isn’t easy to find in Toronto)
18353925,166519943,2017-07-03,16210695,Greg,Freeda was an excellent host. Easy to communicate with and always trying to make the stay better as well as being a very kind person.
9790128,165370795,2017-07-01,1430338,Christoph,The appartment is ideally located next to the Subway and a short walk to Queen West. Lee-Anne is very responsive and happy to accomodate changes in length of our stay!
13769120,533397498,2019-09-21,24738565,Tristan,Karen was a phenomenal host and we would definitely stay here again. The room was clean amenities were great and it was walking distance to everything we needed!
29493659,354873692,2018-12-02,103910182,Jiazhen,Nice place with Tim Hortons nearby. I enjoyed my stay here. They took care of my vehicle which I appreciate a lot!
16000871,140395834,2017-03-29,119495633,Brad Scott,You're going to love this place! 
9549288,102271678,2016-09-17,64368557,Travis,Good location. As soon as we arrived moe left us his apartment as he was leaving to stay overnight elsewhere. It was nice to have the cozy apartment to ourselves. However I did not like that there was a 12 dollar cleaning fee though the place was tidy it certainly wasn't clean. The bedding looked clean but the floors counters kitchen sink (which had dirty dishes giving off a bad smell) bathtub shower curtain bathroom sink and mirror windows were quite dirty. I don't think it was at all fair to have that large cleaning fee for what we received. 
13761209,99196264,2016-09-04,80955646,Elizabeth,The apartment was comfortable and very private and it was luxurious to have two bathrooms.  The location was central and we were able to walk to everything.  Christine's instructions were very clear about how to gain access to the flat.  We would stay there again.
6603272,95380861,2016-08-19,73280535,Jia,Eric and his wife are super nice and friendly. Their house is located in a nice and quiet neighborhood. The room is large and clean with private closet and private bathroom. I think I am the only one staying on the second floor so has a lot of privacy as well. The location is convenient: about 12 minutes walk to the Sheppard and Yonge interaction. It is also close to the  401 highway so you can get right onto it but it is also far enough from the highway so you never hear any noise. 
32527102,531059470,2019-09-16,20993032,Montserrat,Best place to stay if you want to be near everything in Toronto. Great neighborhood very clean and accurate. Our trip was way better than expected!
18754104,170432687,2017-07-15,58235284,Salima,Lynn was a wonferful host. There were no issues with check-in and we were welcomed with a smile. The location was perfect for our weekend in Toronto!
20879798,210869903,2017-11-11,157979983,Jean-Michel,The room was very clean and confortable! Thank you to Sarah!
4223559,23392604,2014-11-30,23532371,Stanley,"Pros: The apartment is situated right in the center of downtown. The apartment was clean and so was the building and the downstairs lobby. Limited Parking was available on first come basis. The hostess was very polite and friendly.

CONS: The apartment is situated right in the center of downtown and because it's only on the third floor there is a great deal noise from traffic and construction. The night life is steps away so it's not uncommon to hear club goers at 3am shouting and screening on the street below.
The apartment was a lot smaller than it appeared in posted photographs.

Overall I recommend this place for any couple. "
127380,101662452,2016-09-14,24801333,Marian,Peggy is a gracious host and I found her home comfortable and charming.  She was knowledgeable in responding to all of my questions and very helpful with advice about getting into the city from the airport and using public transportation and Uber during my trip.

1459100,258782745,2018-04-29,59089029,Linda,We had a great week at Tran's. Check in was super easy. The location is perfect my husband attended a meeting at the convention centre it was just a short walk away. Great restaurants and shopping nearby.  The apartment is clean the beds are really comfortable and the sitting area is roomy and well furnished. We would definitively stay again.
17158410,357070867,2018-12-09,59983792,Roseanne,We loved our stay at Christina’s place. It’s very convenient and accessible. It only took us roughly 10-15 mins to walk to the CN tower with a double stroller.  Smooth check in and check out. I will recommend her place to anyone looking to stay near CN Tower or Rogers Center.
24749302,530902003,2019-09-16,287983464,Nikki,Jay’s place is very clean and inviting. It’s a modernized condo with everything you would need for your stay. He’s very prompt with his responses and very pleasant. And the condo is in a really good area in Toronto. I would definitely stay there again!
19661810,308496054,2018-08-16,192111997,George,Such a great place to stay. Sandra was lovely replied to messages so quickly and stayed up to meet us from a very late flight. Brilliant flat with all the comforts you could need (full kitchen big tv coffee maker microwave etc). Perfect for our family of 4 (3 yr old and a baby). Sandra helped us lots with local tips and is great to chat to. Apartment is in a fantastic location with a very nice area of shops cafes and restaurants to the north and a metro station close to the south. Highly recommend and hope to visit again. 
21753822,246061394,2018-03-24,23196038,SuJung,Great location and fantastic view of CN tower. Nik was very prompt to response and flexible. The place was spotless and had everything we needed. Definitely want to come back again!
20826348,554102341,2019-10-25,293212299,Charlie,Everything was as discribed in the description we had a wonderful time. Indra was very reactive to our questions and full of attentions. The appartement was very clean and we had everything we needed.
6834011,86705475,2016-07-17,69580803,Kyle,Johnathan and Hanan were awesome hosts. Their place was very clean and very homey.  They always had suggestions on places to explorer in the city they were very helpful.  The location was close to everything you need .Overall amazing experience and would most definitely recommend Johnathan and Hanan..... great hosts.
16204975,196257607,2017-09-22,39689172,Fabien,Le logement de Daniela est impeccable et au calme dans un quartier de Toronto. Les petites attentions sont gentilles et il y a tout le confort dans le logement
19308887,564340281,2019-11-15,236792069,Carl,really nice place and and very clean
13879930,112593545,2016-11-06,35432871,Noime,My stay at Matt's was incredible. His place was very clean and tidy. Location was easy to find and is close to a lot of stores. There were snacks provided (sorry almost ate all of them lol) which was a plus. As for the host all I could say is Matt is an incredible host. He was very patient with me especially when I had a lot of trouble accessing the August app. Responded to my messages without me having to wait too long. I'm very satisfied with my stay at his place and for sure will recommend it to my friends 
9214758,524732657,2019-09-06,5528455,James,Great host great accommodation.
25103773,352594422,2018-11-25,68103992,Gali,"First the elevators don't work properly. 
The owner said it's the first time that ever happened but the Tennants are saying it's been going on for two years!
That's a very big deal for a 28th floor apartment.
Kiran did not agree to compensate me for it. 

The apartment is very clean well located with a wonderful view and payed parking in the area. 

Overall: disappointing experience in a nice apartment."
19839950,560082529,2019-11-05,160427419,Adriana,"Fiquei hospedada com meu marido por 04 noites no apartamento e considerando a experiência em outros Airbnb achamos que alguns detalhes precisam ser melhorados como por exemplo:
- a falta de uma mesinha para fazer as refeições. Tivemos que utilizar a mesa de centro da sala o que não é muito confortável.
- não é disponibilizado pano de prato na cozinha. somente um papel toalha o que não achamos prático.
- as gavetas da cozinha estavam muito bagunçadas parecendo que os talheres estão sujos ou velhos tudo misturado.
- a iluminação do apartamento não é muito boa especialmente na bancada da cozinha e no quarto.
- As toalhas de banho poderiam ser de melhor qualidade.
- o chuveiro fica saindo  jatos de água fria as vezes.
- Existiam travesseiros extras mas estes estavam sem fronhas.
- Não entendemos o café da manhã que estaria disponível. A foto do airbnb mostrou uma salada de frutas que não estava disponível. O pão que tinha era apenas cerca de 4 fatias que pareciam ter sobrado de outro hóspede ...
- Acho que um pouco em função do tipo de construção do prédio dava pra escutar muito barulho do apartamento de cima.

Ou seja achamos que faltou um pouco mais de capricho em alguns detalhes.  Decepcionou um pouco.  

No entanto gostamos muito da atenção do Am em solucionar nossas dúvidas prontamente. Sempre responde rapidamente as mensagens. A localização do apartamento bem próximo ao metrô também é muito bom!"
18049018,324725777,2018-09-17,47279685,Graham,Perfect location for cafes restaurants and bars! Jose was very helpful in sorting parking and check in was super easy and convenient! Beds were not the most comfortable but was not an issue for a few nights stay! Would most defiantly recommend!
37566367,551906914,2019-10-20,264354640,Jaime,Beautiful and amazing hosts
7076178,299755365,2018-07-31,84585429,Melissa,Great place to stay. We loved the artistic touches and the location. We had three generations staying together and Jeanie went out of her way to make my 80-year old Dad comfortable. We hope to come back again.
30124380,401037666,2019-01-13,42141305,Muveno,Gary is really chill his place is nice and with great location.
21584038,420399234,2019-03-06,32017547,Greg,My stay was great. The room was exactly as the picture shows so it was what I expected. I would describe it as a clean friendly secure building and the area is quite. I felt safe in the neighbourhood and i was able to get around quickly to downtown.( 20 minutes rush hour). The bed was very comfortable. I got a very goodnight sleep each evening. Scott was great. He communicated well with me during my travels. He was sincerely hospitable. I will definitely stay there again.
2592785,295511910,2018-07-23,29314351,Danjush,Beautiful brown-stone house in a great neighborhood close to many bars cafés and restaurants and - most importantly - a perfectly organized super nice host. Thank you Christine!
36718254,515843497,2019-08-23,130650095,Cheselle,Julia Jeffrey and family are fantastic hosts. This was a great location for me due to where my office was located. The hosts are very attentive courteous and accommodating. I highly recommend this stay. We got the downstairs bedroom and was very pleased with the space and access to use the kitchen. Thank you guys formaking our stay comfortable and welcoming!!
35640709,540021016,2019-10-02,203577902,Rawa,Gracious host!
31987867,514720273,2019-08-21,30875787,Jaimal,Great stay. Perfect location. Beautiful apartment.
14894367,334218714,2018-10-08,177311914,Catherine,Nous avons passé un magnifique séjour dans l'appartement de krista ! Chaleureux et très bien situé tout ce dont nous avions besoin nous était accessible à proximité.
32667184,511635298,2019-08-17,43541527,Jeff,5 Star location! We spent three days in Toronto and once we parked the rental car we never drove it again until we left. So much to do within walking distance of the condo made the trip so simple and enjoyable. Amazing views from the balcony! Five people in our party and the condo had plenty of room to accommodate us.
7325644,269012773,2018-05-26,128321216,Justine,Great place to stay if you wanna explore more then just downtown toronto!
6570486,290474230,2018-07-14,1167757,Sijia,Our family had a great stay in Kim’s house. It’s perfectly located on a quiet street just one block north of Queen street which is full of shops restaurants and bars. The house was super clean large and bright with absolutely everything we needed. The back patio is a dream in the summer! Kim was also very warm and easy to communicate with.
20590984,415008533,2019-02-21,102636900,Risako,"This room is so clean and very nice location! I really recommend!!!
But if you want to leave your luggage you should ask them ASAP.
If you can't have any good solutions you can store Pantages Hotel where is located next to the tower of the room! It takes $10 per bag!"
17349422,291282610,2018-07-15,172358392,Robin,Great host. Super clean.
17925328,168915582,2017-07-10,15445830,Samuel,Stayed 3 nights to catch a few baseball games. Great location stunning view indeed. The location is great and very central to everything. Def a nice place to stay and enjoy Toronto!

7025918,489896868,2019-07-17,15189050,Joseba,Our stay in Toronto couldn’t be better!
19823921,359266194,2018-12-16,30703038,Ciarán,Sheryl’s place was absolutely incredible. It is a haven of tranquility and truly a home away from home. The room was clean quiet and had an amazing bed. The bathroom was sparkling clean and had piping hot showers. Sheryl was a really attentive host and we had great chats about books and her best tips for places to eat and drink in Toronto. I felt incredibly well taken care of. Highly recommended if I ever return I will be back for sure. Thanks Sheryl!
23829974,446525865,2019-05-01,226091803,Sungeun,The address was not accurate when I booked the accommodation. (There was no street number) The host was not able to speak english and they didn't answer the email when I sent them. So I had to call them to figure out the exact address when I arrived near there. The room was ok but the washroom was dirty. Lots of hair dust and unknown blackish things were all over the sink and floor.  The location was good.
2272479,181926765,2017-08-13,137574237,Dave,Vanessa's home was exactly what she advertised. It was comfortable relaxed and fully equipped. Location close to many services and restaurants. Safe and quiet neighbourhood. Close to public transportation. Cosy private backyard. A truly character home that has been uniquely decorated and inviting. We would stay there again without hesitation.
20904663,234430523,2018-02-12,82912814,Jeff,This is a very beautiful home. What you see is what you get plus more. I would definitely come back to this place! The communication from the host made access to this place fairly easy. The large windows in every bedroom gives you a spectacular view of the city.
34500100,528168936,2019-09-12,258570558,Charlotte,A nice little hotel room
6743356,124714076,2017-01-02,107802300,Endrit,We booked the apartment for one night however it was enough to experience the hospitality that Nancy had for us. The apartment was amazing and had a great view. Overall it was a great experience. 
5001297,359938037,2018-12-18,230825555,Marc,This place is amazing. It was everything we wanted it to be when we booked it.. right in the thick of downtown Toronto very stylish and accessible. Sam was wonderful with communicating quickly and with helpful tips. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great price on a premium downtown location.
19552509,241069440,2018-03-07,174925453,Graham,Good price for quality.
23522408,282137936,2018-06-26,25729690,Rustam,The host is friendly and helpful great neighborhood a bit noisy in the morning though. I guess it's 20-30 min to the city center. As for the place itself I liked the appartement for its spacious rooms and the view from the window and for the balcony.
27783522,417543247,2019-02-27,191314725,Kobby,The place is very clean and cozy. It is warm and inviting and I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the place. Roger had everything you would need and some extras in case you forgot your own things like body wash toothpaste and mouthwash to name a few. It was very much like a hotel stay. I definitely recommend this place.
17905708,294803909,2018-07-22,76841516,Allison,Ultimately this place is exactly what it is advertised to be. We chose it as a budget friendly option rather than staying in the downtown core and we were happy with our stay. It’s a quaint cozy little place that has everything you need including some extra snacks and toiletries and is very close to the grocery store which was great.   It was a little farther to the train station than we anticipated ( (Hidden by Airbnb) maps gives it a 19 minute walk time) which isn’t a big deal but give yourself extra time if trying to catch a specific train. It was an easy Uber ride to the downtown core. 
18462898,154961034,2017-05-26,79151766,Daniel,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
16884840,336583313,2018-10-14,165971925,Christine,"Check in was easy ! Renata greeted us at the condo and gave us our keys. Every thing we needed was there for us. Grocery and LCBO across the street. Scotiabank Arena is right around the corner. 
The view from the unit is amazing.
Don’t hesitate to book this condo !!"
4709371,31473105,2015-05-05,2600773,Angelo,Julie was an awesome host she went the extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The apartment matched the description and photos and I definitely recommend staying there if you are visiting Toronto.
15701100,346444402,2018-11-08,48607116,Prenesan,Great apartment in a great location.
18199503,282147786,2018-06-26,90530195,Erick,"Victoria's place is everything that you read about. Her place is clean nice the area is SSSSOOO nice & quiet & it is very easy to check in. Victoria checked in to make sure I was cool (I was very appreciative of her for that). So if you need a place A NICE place to stay in Toronto (VICTORIA'S PLACE IS FOR YOU)

Thank you again Victoria for you A1 Hospitality!!!"

6304719,82821543,2016-06-29,30816189,Andrew,Bobby was a great host during our stay in Toronto. Quick to respond to my questions. The space was very nice and clean. Location was great. Many places within walking distance. Very convenient. Would definitely stay again.

5030730,75621746,2016-05-22,4093044,Yorgos,"The apartment is very nice clean and spacious. The kitchen had all amenities we could need and we really enjoyed breakfast under the sun in the patio.
The location is very central  (just a 20min walk to King station) with many bar and restaurant options nearby. 
Communication with Radu was fast and efficient.
I would definitely recommend this apartment during a visit in Toronto."
22065100,434123355,2019-04-07,2590414,Carrie Lou,Check in was easy and Mirella was very communicative and accommodating. Mirella's place had an amazing view. The bed was super comfortable! The pool/sauna was closed for renovations while I was there so maybe ask if it is open if you are interested in those accommodations.
16392987,171766010,2017-07-18,131857992,Chris,Jesse is an expert communicator and was very welcoming to us. He also offered sound advice on things to see and do while checking in daily via text/email to see if we needed anything. The Fee Place property was the perfect place for our family of six to experience a slice of local life as a Toronto (Website hidden by Airbnb) authentic experience in a world turning more and more corporate everyday.  The location was perfect as many interesting places could be attained on foot or via short distance to public transportation. We chose to drive our own minivan into center city Toronto and also to Lake Ontario beach destinations north of the city and this was a great home base with Queen Street right out the front door so to speak. I'm sure we were not the normal visitors to the property as we have four boys between 10-16. It was cozy as my two younger sons doubled up in one bed but we all slept perfectly and truly felt safe and at home at this property. We would certainly stay here again if given the chance thanks so much Jesse!
27980430,412405584,2019-02-15,129021698,Sean,the decor of the room was great and overall the stay was very accommodating

4069551,176219898,2017-07-30,141410863,Oliver,Shereen was a great host.  No issues good communication.  
3307887,141300951,2017-04-02,82955205,Henson,Damian is a amazing host and his place is as beautiful as the pictures depict. The neighborhood is right off of Queen street which has more than every thing a person travelling to Toronto would like to see. Highly recommend choosing a place by Damian as he is easy to communicate with and a pleasure to do work with!
29395502,410069302,2019-02-09,120569318,Kate,This place was perfect for what we needed.  The kitchen was stocked with everything you could need and then some (rare in Airbnbs I find).  The beds were comfy and everything was clean.  Access to laundry was a real bonus for our family with young kids.  The hosts were also immediately available whenever we needed help with anything.  I would highly recommend this place.
20284734,431736332,2019-04-01,199512089,Andrew,Great apartment and room easy to get to downtown Toronto the airport and other areas of the city.  Leo & Ryan were friendly and welcoming and on hand to help out if needed.
22888342,347518186,2018-11-11,31757424,Sarah,This is a lovely and convenient space. The suite is so well-designed and laid out with a very exceptional shower! Of course as with all basement suites there is not much natural light but probably you will only be there at night anyway like we were! You are steps away from a great neighbourhood and it is also a very easy 15 min walk to the fast and cheap UP train to the airport. The hosts are very helpful and responsive and we really enjoyed our stay at this safe stylish and affordable suite!
20789400,566763230,2019-11-20,63820024,Jacqueline,Great location! Easy check-in and quick communication. The building has good security and besides the usual Toronto construction and street noise the condo was quiet. The condo was fairly clean. Hosts were responsive and listened to feedback for my second stay!
17702093,219909244,2017-12-19,35322461,Nadir,Convenient painless place to stay at with all the amenities and peace and privacy close to a busy area of town. Perfect for a stay a little off the beaten path.

Superbe endroit prêt de tout facile d'accès.

Merci Elizabeth ! "
1826053,271167953,2018-05-31,178767829,Theresa,Cyn was really helpful spontanious and open. Even if the communication with me was sometimes not that easy she always found a way to figure out. The room and the flat was beautiful in a nice vintage stil that especally young people like. Also really central to shops caffees restaurants and busses. She was always into changing deatails to make everything more comftable. I really enjoyed the stay and would recomand to everyone else.
15970302,406662016,2019-01-30,16248665,William,The apartment is beautiful exactly as pictured and described. The place is cosy and super comfortable with helpful touches such as fast wifi luggage rack coffee machine etc. The location is perfect everything you need is within a block or two and downtown and the airport are easily accessible. Friendly hosts. Recommended!
7324823,449368604,2019-05-06,239614653,Ty,Shannon's space is very clean and inviting. Didn't stay long but the location was very impressive. Parking is tough to find on the street though only one side can be parked on as well has very busy. Has nothing to do with Shannon just something to keep in mind.
16548328,469919224,2019-06-15,25112367,Ash,Ben's place was better than what we'd hoped for. The unit is bright and spacious and the rooftop terrace makes it a real gem in the Kensington Market area. There is a Green P lot for overnight parking about a 5 minute walk away. We didn't need the car for much as there was enough to do - restaurants cafes lots of little shops - in the vicinity. Clean and comfy. We really enjoyed our girls getaway in Toronto. Ben was easy to communicate with organized and sent very clear instructions. We would not hesitate to re-book.
22880077,238367563,2018-02-25,170278935,Nathan,Amanda was a great host. She responding quickly to my questions and concerns. The place was amazing and it felt very homey. I loved all of the little details she put into decorating the place. The location was nice and it was just a short street car ride from downtown Toronto which was extremely convenient. The only negative thing that I have to say about my stay here was the parking. It was extremely hard to find parking spots close to the area and I actually end up with 2 parking tickets because of it. I will definitely be coming back!
13634984,135600827,2017-03-05,10877719,Quyen,If you're looking for a central spot in Toronto this is a great value! Clean spacious and conveniently located condo. Highly recommended.
29388347,507359734,2019-08-11,60767162,Daniel,Amazing location. Nice and stylish space. Only reason for the deduction of a star was because there was no shampoo which I would expect as a basic amenity.
31212198,365588858,2019-01-01,168052184,Shaneeka,I loved how this place was prepared clean it’s a comfortable home to be in really enjoyed it

33587868,466695600,2019-06-09,229259462,Jessica,Clean and quite. It is close to downtown without the hustle and bustle. I would stay again.
15537875,150875585,2017-05-09,125562813,Jacob,Really nice spot in Toronto close to many vegan restaurants. Hosts were easily reached and there was a lot of privacy. Some downsides were that we were given two towels for a party of two for a whole week. The bed could've used more pillows and I was not a fan of the down-stuffed comforter... Not very comforting to sleep with the feathers of dead birds. Other than that it's a really good spot. 
22085668,524736311,2019-09-06,23586882,Emily,Adorable little spot close to downtown. Very clean!
32319962,501446309,2019-08-03,163096290,Jaime,Paola was very warm and kind. The Uber driver had a hard time finding the location and Paola was able to direct us over the phone. Very cozy and clean space.
9651151,210108410,2017-11-07,154243817,Helene,Highly recommended.
9797332,456005722,2019-05-20,28251325,Jonathan,We stayed at Kfir and Devin's place with our two young children and had a great time in this amazing neighborhood! Would recommend it for sure!
23880006,306346272,2018-08-12,102903648,Jocelyn,The place was nice and cozy and close to restaurants and stores 
18221674,166810452,2017-07-04,4568952,Matthieu,"Lovely house in a lovely neighborhood!!!
Perfect stay I definitely recommend."
7382746,515232379,2019-08-22,129217228,Marco,"We stayed in the private room for six nights and enjoyed staying there. The place is only 15 minutes walk away from the CN Tower and around 7 minutes to the waterfront. The rooms were clean and it was wonderful to step on the balcony of the shared living room in the morning to enjoy a relaxed cup of tea while having a great view from the 11th floor. Amy who mostly communicated with us as well as Kat were a great help with all questions raised and communicatioan was always on time and very nice and polite. We also used the quite practical parking lot under the building which was offered to a comparable price to the public parking lots close to the building. 

All in all we would come again and like to say ""Thank you very much Amy and Kat!"""
11960053,148877650,2017-05-01,87605275,Steven,Vlad's space was a bit smaller than expected but an amazing place nonetheless. Easy check-in beautiful bathroom great view modern space but no affordable parking near by. 
21809863,270081882,2018-05-28,186187310,Hubret,Appartement bien placé et proche des commodités. Qualité / prix corrects.
13064101,87496325,2016-07-20,71404951,Vanessa,"This Toronto apartment was very well appointed and comfortable. 
Basics like oil and salt and pepper provided as well as coffee machine and pods sugar creamer.
Bed was super comfortable.
Access to the apartment was really well thought out - no need to meet up with owner etc
Right in downtown - lots of restaurants close by and easy walking distance to everything.
Would recommend for short or long stay. We wish we could have stayed a little longer."
13510011,122301399,2016-12-22,71386008,Christa,We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely come again if we need to stay in the city.

35085633,508344541,2019-08-12,176500386,Mia,"Lana’s home is cozy homey clean and had more than enough space for my family of four. It is exactly as pictured. Lana kept our fridge fully stocked with breakfast and snacks and drinks that the kids were happy to dig into when we checked in late after a long day of traveling and enjoyed throughout our stay.

There is no kitchen but a five-minute walk away is Pusateri’s a gourmet food grocer that offers delicious cooked food we heated in the microwave. Lana provides enough plates glasses and cutlery but also provides disposables. She also provides enough cleaning supplies for our six day stay. Special requests like an ironing board or additional coffee were promptly accommodated.

Her home is also very close to shops and we loved taking walks through the neighborhood (it is lovely). 

Being a basement unit some footsteps and shuffling could be heard from time to time (which we expected) but it was not bothersome for us.

As this was our first Airbnb booking overseas (hotels are our default choice) we were not sure what to expect but if our experience in Lana’s home is the standard then we are converts!"
14222612,320991498,2018-09-09,34079854,Lena,Although I had never met Jordan before the trip I felt like I was staying at a friend's house my entire visit. His adorable cats stylish decor and warm hospitality made me feel right at home. The place is exactly like the description. And the location is absolutely amazing. There was clear communication throughout my stay. I'd recommend this place to anyone and hope to be staying here again on my next visit.

19601128,287077292,2018-07-07,17209914,Christa,Enough space for 4 near to public transport quiet place - ok for short stay
6227042,204122114,2017-10-16,87850159,Sanket,Great location. The host made sure the stay was comfortable. Small things in the kitchen and bathroom such as coffee condiments utensils soaps etc were taken care of. This was very helpful especially when travelling with two kids. Parking was the only add-on expense. There is a public parking right across the street which adds at least $28 per day.
8195595,537409598,2019-09-28,102679653,Crisiane,Raoul is very kinde and have a very well located and stylish apartment.
1038285,5148751,2013-06-15,5417954,Marc,Ennis has an awesome and very spacious loft space. The interior is great and very comfortable and clean. The location is very convenient and just steps away from the public transport streetcar on king west. There are a few cafes and restaurants within close proximity. Ennis was very helpful and accommodating throughout my stay. He checked up frequently in case I needed anything and he was kind enough to leave a complimentary bottle of wine fresh fruit and juice. The GO train station (exhibition station) is also a 5 minute walk from the loft in case you want to take a trip outside Toronto. The loft is safe and well lit. I would definitely recommend Ennis' place for anyone visiting Toronto. 
27406413,346690143,2018-11-09,26164929,Paul,William’s home has a bed kitchen and shower which are all reasonably up to date. The location was extremely close to the Kensington market area but nestled away from the noise. I had a small problem with the WiFi and sent a message to William who responded in under five minutes with a way for me to reset the router (located in another part of the home). The problem was quickly resolved and I was left quite impressed with William’s responsiveness.
985072,146141778,2017-04-21,96672130,Dave,Stefan is a great host.  I had a few requests and he accommodated me with exactly what I needed.  His place is exactly like described with a great entry system.  For someone staying for a short visit and wanting a great value you can't go wrong.

Relax with inspiring artwork enjoy sunset views from the porch and patio deck and rest easy knowing you are taken care of by Meagan should you have any questions. Look no further and enjoy everything this space has to offer.

11531645,173640562,2017-07-23,52852942,Heather,Aaron's place was exactly as described. It was clean and comfortable and a great location if you are planning on visiting Toronto sights. It's about 25 minutes from the CN tower aquarium the ROM museum and other attractions. Aaron's place is in a quiet neighborhood which was really nice to come back to after a busy day. We would definitely stay at Aaron's place again! 
20010119,239146189,2018-02-28,58157123,Steve,Lidias home is in a great location and is minutes away from public transit. Lidia is warm welcoming and very receptive to my requests and questions. The room was small but the perfect size for me. 6 out of 5 stars! Everything was very clean. She's got a shower that probably belongs in a resort. Best shower of my life.
36795809,524313068,2019-09-05,892369,Tariq,Once again lovely and comfortable stay! Thanks for having me.

599591,112771205,2016-11-07,97180364,Nicole,Michelle's place was just as described and super cozy. It isn't shown in the pictures but there is a vestibule between the door to the street and the interior door. It was great for hanging up coats and storing shoes so you don't have to bring them in the apartment. The sofa was ridiculously comfortable as well as the bed. Michelle left great instructions and checking in was easy.

15674452,112785612,2016-11-07,40334695,Joel,Loved this place. Quirky converted gallery/photo show room ... Trying to figure out what it had been originally was part of the charm. It's a great use of the space. Location is top notch it's central but on a fairly secluded side street and easy walking distance to all areas of downtown Toronto.

787074,83839562,2016-07-04,35356111,Mai,We spent 3 nights for our first visit in Toronto. The penthouse is just as what you see on the pictures. When we check in her husband Will helped us guide with very clear instructions. Our check in was really late but he made sure we got in. The building is very secure with garage for cars to park. Inside the house was very clean and well decorated. We enjoyed sitting at balcony and just looking at great view. The location was great. We mostly commute with our car and everything took around 20 mins. Thank you Tracy and Will for making our trip so wonderful! 
24489663,287023534,2018-07-07,8985221,Anne,Merci beaucoup Laure pour ce séjour. Le quartier est animé bien desservi (bus et métro à 10 min de marche) et l'appartement est agréable.

I felt instantly welcomed when I came in my train was delayed and Shirin stayed up till I got there and helped me with my luggage. Other than getting towels an extra blanket was provided as well in case it got cold. The location was by far my favorite aspect of this home. It was so very close to St-Lawrence market and the distillery and I really enjoyed visiting both of these.
3400979,426597284,2019-03-21,248440369,Meagan,Clean and cozy!

8357937,200477705,2017-10-05,39785331,Zohra,Analiza's place is impeccably clean (gets an A++) spacious and tastefully decorated. As a host Analiza is very friendly and thoughtful going the extra mile to make sure you have a great stay.  I particularly appreciated the snacks and cold drinks in the fridge and access to the kitchen fully equipped with quality appliances to make tea/coffee warm food or do any light cooking. Communication with Analiza was very easy and she was very accommodating to my last minute request to stay at her place.  The place is very close to subway station and there are many great amenities nearby. I would highly recommend Analiza's place.

I totally can recommend their place!

24912088,558103718,2019-11-02,12554271,Sheir,"Arriving in the dark rainy Halloween night was a bit of a challenge.
Irene cleared a parking spot for me as I required parking.
The room was spacious clean and did open to a deck; which I did not use as I was out most of the day.
There is a shared bathroom but that was not an issue as there was only one other guest and Irene provided towels soap and shampoo.
I enjoyed my stay and would recommend her place."

David is a nice guy and his very helpful information available for Toronto and how everything works for the apartment.

L'appartement est très confortable et nous nous sommes sentis tout de suite comme à la maison grâce aux nombreuses petites attentions de leur part. Nous sommes arrivés un soir et c'était très appréciable de trouver le réfrigérateur contenant de quoi faire le petit déjeuner le lendemain :) le jardin est très agréable et nous avons été visités plusieurs soirs par une famille de ratons laveurs ! Le quartier est résidentiel et très agréable proche des plages et bien desservi par les transports publics. Nous reviendrons sans hésiter chez Darren et Derek pour notre prochain voyage à Toronto.

10791293,346413562,2018-11-08,221163999,Tara,"It was my first time renting a shared place and I had a great experience. Angela and Giuliana were wonderful host very kind very helpful available if I needed anything and also respected my privacy
My first day there Angela offered to show me around the neighborhood and I’m very happy I took her offer since everything was walking distance and it was easy to get to Downtown Eaton Center is two and half kilometers away. Yonge's Street is just three blocks away plenty of shopping and eating area and the subway is walking distance.
Angela’s place is in the quite side of the street and its safe walking around and if you need a cab you either walk to the street and hail one or just call Co-Op Taxi they are there less than 5 minutes.
I can’t say enough how wonderful the host’s was I felt at home and super comfortable and was really happy to find a great place very clean exactly like the picture safe neighborhood and super helpful host’s I will definitely stay there again . I took the limo service Aerofleet to the airport and it cost $53. Again thanks to the great host’s Angela and Giuliana I had a wonderful stay at their place."

As for the hosts they were extremely thoughtful and we could always rely on their advice and quick response. They really made us feel at home!
As AirBnb virgins we weren’t quite sure of what to expect. This experience was well beyond our expectations and I recommend it to anyone coming to Toronto."

516823,4211185,2013-04-19,2270227,Rita,Enjoyed staying in this neat little ground floor flat. Ultra quiet. You cant't even hear the airplanes nor any traffic which was amazing. The flat is also exceedingly clean. Best suited for one person or a couple. Bus takes you to the nearest West Dundas subway station. I also visited the shiatsu massage on the main st. thus releasing some traveller's  foot pain!  Wishing  our hosts Ina and Paul many happy visitors two ladies from Iceland and Finland.

32010500,455323494,2019-05-19,243874192,Paty,This was a great experience! We were a group of friends and we all agree this was by far the best place we have ever stayed. Lots of great details that made a difference: cozy and amazing beds warm and lots of blankets croissants and nice things for our breakfast. The house is even more beautiful than in pictures.
8427466,107646968,2016-10-11,98467997,Brian,Mike's AirBNB complete with all the amenities you need was plenty spacious enough for our group of 5 adults. Mike's warm helpful and incredibly thorough welcome made me feel more like an old friend than a tourist in a new neighborhood. Speaking of the neighborhood is a beautiful quiet part of Toronto with very easy access to public transit though you could easily spend a few days just within walking distance of the AirBNB. The effort put into making this a dream location cannot be understated and Mike's listing will be the first I look for when I come back to Toronto.
6947407,138617291,2017-03-20,53210286,Rachel,Such a great stay! :) Benjamin had great communication even sent us a picture of the outside of the house to help us find it). Being honest I don't know Toronto very well but there were plenty of restaurants and bars just a quick walk away! The apartment looked bigger than the picture which was a pleasant surprise it was a great stay thanks so much! :) 
20861189,318789623,2018-09-04,184158295,Kessashun,This place is very clean and utilizes the space quite thoughtfully. It is more than equipped with everything you need to live comfortably during your stay. I love how there are notes all around the house to answer any questions you may run into about how things work or where to find things. The neighborhood is nice with plenty of great restaurants cafes and bars as well as the beach within walking distance. I'd highly recommend this home to anybody visiting the Toronto area.
15621447,261583779,2018-05-06,181793599,Mel,I loved that there was alot of effort made to make this a comfortable stay. Beautiful house with nice touches in a quiet residential neighbourhood. I loved meeting other guests who were sweet and respectful. Appreciated the breakfast options. Very close to Warden station a 7-10 min walk. Budi's wife is amazing and I will miss her laughter honesty advice and care. I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Thank you!

16543613,472826398,2019-06-20,178856564,Terri,Our stay at Matt’s was great. It’s the perfect spot if you are in town for a Jays Raptors or Leafs game as well as concerts. It was walking distance to everything. All in all it was a great experience.

주차하고 커피한잔 하면서 여행 계획을 세울수 있어서 아주 아주
좋았습니다. 
하지만 숙소는 화장실이 한개 밖에 없어 가족여행으로는 조금 힘든
환경이며 지하방은 축축하고 다소 공기도 순환이 되지 않아 답답했네요.
하지만 주차장 걱정이 없어서 편안했습니다."
25208606,404582911,2019-01-24,143580648,Ciaran,The place was fine in all aspects but was much smaller than the description and photos depicted. There's barely room to walk between the sink bed and desk seen in the photos. It wasn't much cheaper than roomier accommodation around the same area.
5025880,123678455,2016-12-30,87847819,Mitch,Extremely clean and well kept. Great for 2 people looking to explore the city. Public transit is a 2 minute drive away and it'll take you to the heart of Toronto. Lina and Paul are very quick responders when you have a question. Great people and a lovely place. 
7801902,109273210,2016-10-20,2762180,Kris,Alex was quick to respond to any questions and although we didn't meet him we didn't need to. Check in and out was easy as key was left at reception.  Location was great and it was exactly how described.

14693392,220091416,2017-12-20,38187839,Asif,I stayed at Karadice's place and it went beyond my expectations. Firstly the view and location of the Airbnb is phenomenal CN tower right outside the window Ripley's aquarium within walking distance and within walking distance (5mins Max) to Union Station. Staying at the heart of downtown in an exceptionally well-kept condo truly made my stay at the Airbnb one worth remembering. Thank you Karadice my girlfriend and I truly appreciate your hospitality and plan on visiting again in the near future!

Matt and Daniele were very accommodating and the place had lots of space and was clean with lots of fresh towels and a fridge of goodies. The beds were really comfy too!"

35043888,547586200,2019-10-15,275290289,Hannah,Jessica’s place is a must if you’re planning a trip to Toronto! It is such a cute little suite with every amenitie you could ever need! It’s located super close to all transit routes super easy to access the subway and and a short uber ride from downtown and the airport! There are so many restaurants near by that make the location even MORE convenient! Such a cute little place i thoroughly enjoyed my stay here :)
35720525,528745962,2019-09-13,73159050,Jakub,I really enjoyed stay at Brayden’s place. The rooms are nice equipped clean with comfy beds. I have experience with rooms #1 and #4. Brayden is doing cleaning around house regularly even every day. Communication was quick and without any issues. Brayden’s house is easy to reach from YYZ Int. airport with public transportation (TTC bus service with one change). To travel to downtown I can recommend to take TTC Express bus service (2 min walk on bus stop from house) to Jane subway station and take Line 2 to downtown. Good value for the money.

Highly recommended!"
34621593,536885419,2019-09-27,293523080,Jessica,This place is exceptional. The space was super functional spotless and ultra sleek down to the details. Such a beautiful place to wake up and come back to each day! It's on a quiet street but is minutes away from lots of restaurants cafes and shops by foot or by streetcar. Communication with the host was also really easy. Hasmig's prompt response to resolve an issue I experienced on my first day went above and beyond my expectations for Airbnb. She made sure I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Would definitely recommend- and would stay here again.

- manque d'isolation phonique 
- est très bruyant au niveau du chauffage -air pulsé-
- est situé au sous-sol.
Le supplément de prix pour une troisième personne est exagéré; 30€ par nuit!
En revanche la décoration est originale et la salle de bains très lumineuse."

She is a very nice woman and very responsive. She will go the extra mile to accommodate your needs. Her place is in a quiet neighbourhood and very cozy. Will definitely consider her place if I'm going back to the area"

They met us on arrival and showed us around the rooms that I would be staying in.  They explained the few rules where emergency cell and taxi numbers were posted on the walls.  
They took the time to show us some maps and areas of interest.  
The house was excellent and exactly as it was shown on the airbnb site.  I would recommend Dale and Karen's place to anyone. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Toronto and if it is available.

Cleanliness wasn’t great but adequate. Little details just weren’t thought about here. Location was great though. The price may be right but I won’t be back.
16071387,115993749,2016-11-27,30162103,Romain,I highly recommend this Airbnb. We had an amazing stay at Ruth and Alan. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. It's very close from the subway station and from downtown. Ruth and Alan were very helpful you will find all the informations and personal advices you need about all the activities in Toronto in the apartment they even managed to print is tickets for the Niagara Falls. I've used a lot Airbnb to travel and this apartment is definitely one of the best I've stayed in. The price is also very reasonable for the quality of this Airbnb. 
18138067,407262959,2019-02-01,195890319,Ashley,Benjamin is a great host! Awesome place and fantastic communication.

24099030,441078638,2019-04-21,248345690,Isabella,This house is is gorgeous and a walking distance from breweries restaurants and even a dog park! (Perfect for any of you dog parents like myself) Their response time is quick and they are super friendly! They even offered help with my nervous dog. The style and house itself are perfect my best friend and I were so in love we wanted to move into the neighborhood. Definitely look into the recommendations listed in the welcome book so many are provided. The only thing is that the beds were firmer than I would have liked however I will say that I would highly recommend and will definitely plan to stay here again!

4387230,564374460,2019-11-15,148257799,Megan,This is an artsy loft. If you are looking for a boutique hotel this won’t quite suit you. Location is close to downtown transit. Lots of space to create.
5286926,48008407,2015-09-22,31954519,Anne,I think it may be some time since michelle visited her home.  one of the main reaszons i chose it was because of the outside space. The reality was that this was neglected overgrown and downright dirty. The barbeque needed a good clean and the area around the bins was untidy unsightly and grubby.       The bathrooms and kitchen were clean and modern. However the lounge which was very favourably represented in the photos  was in fact dull and badly in need of a facelift.  By far the worst aspect of this house was the stairs which were narrow and steep and had no handrail  making it incredibly difficult for us to get our suitcases upstairs and would be totally unsafe for children.  In the closet in the second bedroom the lower rail could only be used for hanging clothes by removing the vacuum a blow-up mattress and a double duvet. Once removed there was nowhere to store these items other than on the floor which left little space. 
32160993,562955113,2019-11-11,275848737,Baris,Jenny's apartment was great. It was so clean and It was in a great location.

Wycliffe and Marion are the most gracious hosts and as sweet as they can be. They left us things like local honey coffee creamer  fresh fruit snack bars and many other things we enjoyed not to mention the beautiful tulips on the kitchen and dining room table.  Thank you so much for opening your lovely home to us.
13634984,245733251,2018-03-23,62726965,Simon,Liz's place is great.   Very tasteful decor and furniture throughout the apartment and unlike other Airbnb's I have stayed in Toronto it feels like a home.  Great size bathroom and all the amenities you could need. Perfectly located for the harbour or downtown and Sobey's is conveniently only 2 mins walk if you want to buy groceries wine or Beer.  Liz was more than accommodating and was always in touch with me throughout my stay making sure I was happy.

Wir hatten zwei Zimmer für eine Nacht gebucht. Die Zimmer lagen im 2. Stock und waren nur durch Treppen erreichbar. Die Zimmer waren durch ein Gemeinschaftsbad verbunden dieses war sehr sauber und auch gut groß. Ein Zimmer war schön auch angenehm groß und mit Fenster das andere hatte leider kein Fenster und war etwas ungemütlich für eine Nacht aber vollkommen in Ordnung! 
Erreichbar ist die Unterkunft vom Flughafen leider ziemlich schwer mit Taxi und Uber ist es am einfachsten!
Die Gastgeber waren sehr freundlich und stets hilfsbereit!"

25841437,522656218,2019-09-02,52752122,Lindsay,"Carmine was very responsive. We had arrived a bit earlier than I had thought we would and since there weren't visitors the day before we could do a slightly early check in which was nice. We picked up the key from the next street over. While we were picking up the key we were made aware that there was a parking garage across the street. It ended up being pretty expensive to keep it there. It was about CAN$30 a day and we happened to be driving in during an ""event"" time so it was more costly. It was convenient to use the app to add time onto the car's parking meter. 

During our first night the building's fire alarm was going off in our apartment around 11 at night. We were pretty startled by it but Carmine had picked up on one of the first rings and told us to just remain put and that they would make an announcement shortly which they did. This put us at ease a bit and we didn't have any other issues for any of the other nights we were there. 

There was a lot of furniture in the space such as 2 kitchen tables one of which being directly in front of the (Website hidden by Airbnb) definitely wouldn't recommend this townhouse for more than 6-7 people. Otherwise i could definitely see it being cramped. We had 5 people so it was very reasonable. 

It was within walking distance of the CN tower the blue jays stadium harborside area about 20-30 minutes from the ferrys to the Toronto islands and a quick Uber ride anywhere else. There's a grocery store located across the street at the corner which was extremely convenient for cooking breakfasts and dinners back at the house to save some money. The store had wine ciders and beers as well so no need to go to a different liquor store either for drinks for the weekend.

Overall a very positive experience and the extra money to be close to the heart of the city felt worth it for our first time in Toronto!"

Die Ausstattung im Haus ist eher spartanisch aber war für mich ausreichend. Die Lage der Unterkunft ist toll zur Tram und vielen Bars und Spätis sind es nur wenige Schritte. Besonders empfehlenswert ist der Spaziergang zum Riverdale Park East (15min) und ein Frühstück im ""Lady Marmalade"". Da muss man längere Wartezeiten einplanen aber die gibt es nicht grundlos ;-)."

954935,9786824,2014-01-10,10274144,Jack,"We had a mixed experience staying here. They were on the whole very good hosts. They were very welcoming and Doug in particular was very quick and polite in handling any issues we had.

On the negative side this accommodation does not have central heating as advertised. It gets heat from the main house and you do not have control. Although they did supply a small additional radiator in the depths of a very cold Toronto winter the heating was insufficient. In addition the noise travels very easily in this house. They did explain that this was dues to the house being old etc. but I feel it should have been mentioned in the advert as I have seen similar adverts with noise warnings.

Most of our experience was pleasant and they are good hosts. But the cold and noise was a bit of an issue.  "

Great apartment super clean and nice professional amenities in the building (pool and workout room full time front desk security).  

This was our second time staying here (both for a week long stays) and it’s the perfect longer stay place for us.  Gives the 3 of us enough space and quiet for longer stays to come home and relax. 

Chris is a super host  always there when we show up to greet us and walk us thru the condo for the tour. 

We can’t recommend he place enough!

We will be staying there again the next time we are back in a few months!"

Also if you don't feel like cooking your own breakfast there is a very good place to eat within a short walk called Cory's We ate there all there mornings we were there. Very good and the people are so friendly and helpful.
10633629,87581910,2016-07-20,54623201,Mark,From the moment of booking through to arrival and departure Maureen went to great lengths to make our stay enjoyable and stress free. The apartment itself was of a high standard cleancomfortable and well equipped. There was a lot of information to hand on the area and it led to us enjoying our time in Toronto hugely. We would definitely stay again!
9975236,364339330,2018-12-30,35087672,Lenny,"The location of this Airbnb is absolutely amazing. Everything is within pretty much walking distance. If you are foodies and would like to pig out at Chinatown this is the perfect place to be.

Also walking distance to places like CN tower and Eaton Center. 

The space is not huge but it’s perfect for two people. Sparkling clean.

Overall i’d recommend this Airbnb to all of my friends visiting Toronto in the future"

The home is located within minutes of the subway station and Yonge Street. The park and path are a bonus. Sandra was warm and welcoming. She went over and beyond our expectations is order to make our stay convenient and comfortable.  We look forward to staying in her home again.

7076178,172046829,2017-07-19,24953686,Lauren,"This space is 100 times better in person than the photos show! The area is walking distance to everything- we went to a show at the Budweiser stage- took us 15 minutes MAYBE you can see the needle just right out side. There was a parking spot just for us and it was very easy to get too! We have an extra large group & Jeanie was wonderful to accommodate us. Our other Airbnb canceled on us and with little time to plan a place for 8- we all agreed this was a blessing in disguise! For more than 2 girls- I recommend you bring a mirror. We had 5 girls fighting for one mirror 
Thanks again Jeanie! "
3229169,44523790,2015-08-27,7350671,Judie,The lisitng was acurate and the neighborhood was perfect.  Stephanie was an excellent host greeting me on the first day but not hovering after that.  She was available as needed.  
33494208,566813378,2019-11-20,308136797,Andrea,I would recommend this place they were very friendly people. They greeted me at arrival and msg me while I was staying there to see if I needed anything. The space was very clean and a nice location.. walking distance to a few stores like tim hortons. I really enjoyed the flat screen tv's.
12209213,96855622,2016-08-24,30476757,Anthony,"Grace was perfect to help me in a bind. On business trip and missing one night of hotel due to no vacancy convenient for my work and with reasonable cost. I booked only one day before and Grace was very accommodating to help me get this done with no hassle. She's a pro at handling this kind of booking and I was very happy with her place and was very comfortable. I only stayed for 9hrs though :) 

I would consider again for longer work trips in the future since it was so easy to get to my work by subway and I don't have to eat out if I don't want to and cook something simple.

Thanks very much Grace it was a pleasure dealing with you!"
17775203,430383870,2019-03-30,104345586,Mc,It's an awesome and very clean apartment - sleeping arrangements super comfortabl.  Shawn is quick to respond and getting in is super easy!
17225632,151401368,2017-05-12,10778121,Chris,"Very kind host and very accommodating. He is very easy to communicate with and flexible to make sure you have the best stay you can. I was actually running really late and called him at about 10:30PM to say I would probably get there at 1:30AM and he was willing to stay up and wait for me. He was able to remotely unlock the front door for me when I got there (I don't think he lives at the same place he is renting) and I didn't have to wait outside or have any trouble getting in touch with him. He handled this well and made it a smooth experience for me. 

I would recommend it to a friend and I would definitely stay again."
18052905,417566631,2019-02-27,25245466,Crystal,Location  Location. Location.  This place has everything you need to have a great stay in Toronto's downtown area. Close to everything.

17639373,144033252,2017-04-14,32101325,Alesio,Great place near all the places that matter. You could walk to CN Tower (30 minutes) or go to a restaurant in the same street or buy something at the supermarket in the corner. 
21884640,483353465,2019-07-07,13755465,Donna,The location was nice and convenient to downtown canoe park and the water.  The handbook was informative and after staying here we understood why they were strict regarding the noise and the no shoes in the house. There’s some dog droppings around the area and the walls must be thin since we were asked to turn down our tv when it was just at 15 volume. The apartment included a washer/dryer and dishwasher which is helpful for a long stay. Kcups and soda are available for $1 each. The small bedroom is separated by a curtain and has no windows but the bed was comfy. The larger bedroom has a great view but can be loud in the morning due to construction and the bed squeaks a lot. Overall we enjoyed our stay but felt with some small details the place could have been better.
4002741,264326680,2018-05-13,184377653,Emilie,"J'ai séjourné 9 nuits chez Elaine et Greg et j'ai passé un agréable séjour malgré qu'ils étaient absents (je ne les ai rencontré que le dernier jour). Beaucoup de marques d'attention un peu partout. J'ai été très vite à l'aise. Le personnel aidant est aussi adorable. J'ai rencontré des gens formidables.
Je recommande pour toute la chaleur que cette maison dégage. J'espère y revenir. Merci !"
14076501,304023814,2018-08-08,82161851,Shawna,We had a good stay at Bryan’s Condo. The location is amazing and good value for money. The check in went very smooth and Bryan was always available if needed. The only issue was the lack of curtains on the windows. We did have a great stay all in all. Thanks!

35771330,510875861,2019-08-16,220034652,Elvira,We had a very comfortable stay in the flat with a great view on the lake Ontario. The flat was very well furnished with all that you could possibly need and with enough space for four persons. Also very nice was the fast walk to union station (approximately 2 min). We enjoyed our stay.

It’s great for business travelers since the there is a self check in process and very centrally located to many restaurants. 

Do not hesitate to book!"
23309267,405629821,2019-01-27,102090659,Chris,Everything was fantastic and very clean. We slept well and had access to everything we needed. We were woken up a little early by some commotion above us so people who may need to sleep-in should consider that there is a child living upstairs. Was not a big deal for us though thanks again for having us Chris! We will be in touch next time we're in town :)
31801034,532332906,2019-09-19,102780503,Ashley,Joseph was very accommodating and quickly responded to my questions. Location is excellent and the place is very clean and tidy. I would definitely stay here again whenever I visit Toronto.

22344184,488174759,2019-07-14,225489417,Margaret,"I was in need of a place to stay just for a weekend visit to the city to move some things from storage and  I cannot say enough good things about Shreya and her mothers place. 

Shreya wasn’t there for my stay but her mother was and she was absolutely wonderful and catered to all my needs and was excellent on communication. I stayed with a friend of mine to aid in the moving process and although we only had a short time to get to know Shreya’s mother she was always so kind and friendly to us; we felt like we could truly count on her for anything and that she always had our best interests in mind. She was willing to make accommodations—especially for parking and offered space in her garage—and was extremely  thoughtful in both hospitality and giving us privacy. The latter was a slight concern for me in the beginning before booking as I had never stayed in an Airbnb where the host lived in the building with you but rest assured she was always very polite and courteous. We had breakfast at her cafe on Saturday and the food was just delicious (try the tuna sandwich seriously) and speaking with her was a delight. Her warmth and friendliness made our stay!

The space itself is as pictured. It can feel a little cramped if you have a lot of things (very large luggage) or more than 2 people but otherwise it’s exactly what you see and everything is well cleaned and refreshed. As others have mentioned the bed is very stiff/firm; this may be an issue for a small few with back troubles but I personally had no complaints or pains. The stairwell down to the basement is a squeeze if you’re over 5’8” but manageable nevertheless. Otherwise there is plenty of amenities available and everything feels new. The room is very welcoming and neatly kept. It was warm while we were there and so I was very thankful for the standing fan left for us. 

Also worth mentioning the location is awesome if you plan on walking around at all or taking the TTC. Ossington station is very close by and this was crucial to hitting up all
the city’s best attractions in the short amount of time we had there.

Overall we greatly enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend it to any one or two people in need of a lovely little home to stay in."
13769149,230633744,2018-01-28,7918039,Sara-Clare,Alison’s place was prefect. Clean check in was a breeze & response time was amazing! We will definitely stay here again.
2447231,53921196,2015-11-14,4872412,Peter And Richard,Andrew's place is exactly as described.  The location is near to the heart of the City but in an older part surrounded by heritage houses and tree lined streets.  The apartment is very clean well equipped tidy and comfortable just as illustrated and provided us with much needed quiet.   The bedroom is easily accessible on the top floor and looks out over the treescape of the City.  Towels and bedding were first grade.  The bedroom has plenty of closet space.    We didn't use the kitchen but it was there to be used complete with pots and pans and all things necessary.  Our stay was short so we had no cause to use the washer and dryer but they were there and available for our use.  The bathroom was nicely positioned private and spacious.  All appliances modern and clean.  We were comfortable that our early  waking and breakfast noises were not disturbing with the kitchen being away from the bedrooms.    Andrew was the perfect host and accommodated our strange arrival and departure times without hesitation.  Access was easy and keys were provided exactly as planned.  Andrew made sure that there was no doubt about the arrangements and quick to reply to emails. And let's not forget the cat - George Michael -  the happiest and friendliest of cats.  We strongly recommend Andrew's place for a quiet and relaxing and stress free home away from home.
17979234,558194906,2019-11-02,207682691,Sedrick,This place is really great and well-maintained. You'll really feel at home. It's also very near downtown so everything is so convenient.

Lots of nice touches and recommendations for local restaurants. Super clean. Great shower! I was genuinely delighted with that! 

The location is ideal. Downtown is easily accessible within 10-15mins bus/streetcar. Handy kitchen means you can breakfast at home before setting out for the day. It has all you need! 

Perfect place for exploring Toronto. It’s a great base. We could be gone for hours but never be more that 30-40 minutes from the place. Brockton village the area that it’s in is super cool. Loads of great restaurants cafes and little shops. If this place is free on your dates BOOK!!!!"

6278049,156175705,2017-05-29,1200551,Linna,This was our first trip to Toronto and my husband and I had a great time staying at Ramnathan's place. He and his wife greeted us when we checked in and out were friendly gave some tips (prior to our stay on how to travel to his home) and also made some suggestions on things to do (one of which we did that day - a visit to Ripley's aquarium). Their home was located in a nice luxury building and the listing was accurate as described. We could have cooked but did not want to on this trip but appreciated being able to. The place was clean and comfortable. The location was great - we walked everywhere and took the streetcar/subways a few times. If we come back to Toronto I would stay here again. Thanks!

10681478,60807904,2016-01-27,55927706,Josh,Listing description was very accurate. Place was clean and comfortable with a smooth and easy transaction.

24283683,264245193,2018-05-13,151572808,Andrew,Sonam has a nice place! We met him briefly during check in and he let us know he was available if we need anything. He was responsive and helped us out when we asked. Located right next to Queen street a bit of a walk to the city center (or a couple bucks on an uber). We ordered food from Amicos pizzeria nearby the tortellini and steak sandwich were great! Bed was also super comfortable. The room was as clean as you can get it. We recommend choosing Sonams place if you're looking for great value near the city. We know where we're staying next time we visit Toronto.
21748991,458072704,2019-05-25,75901750,Dan,Sarah’s place is prime location and quiet at night.  The space is great for 1-2 people and easily accessible. The bed was very comfortable as well.

16437963,173082874,2017-07-22,124865989,Jessica,Thomas's place was a great place to stay for the weekend. Unfortunately the top floor was very hot due to a broken air conditioner. Thomas had contacted me afterwards to apologize and to tell me he was not aware of the problem. He did say that the problem was fixed now so for future travelers this would be a great place to stay!
20055838,347671289,2018-11-11,42144766,Katharina,Everything was perfect. Allen & Tatanya are very friendly and helpful! The low ceiling can be a problem for tall people.

15112971,210681964,2017-11-10,111629082,Shahan,Had an amazing stay here. The place was very clean and tidy. Very quiet. And had no issues parking in the lot across the street.
5025880,77989347,2016-06-04,52125957,Chinmay,"your visit to toronto is incomplete if you dont stay at lina and paul's place. it was really an exceptional experience.
First we were very tired after a 20 hr flight and Paul came to pick us up from go station at 10.30 in night which we had never expected from a host. He drove us to his place explaining about the neighborhood. We wanted to have dinner and it was very late in the night but still Lina drove us to nearest restaurant and a grocery store. 
Both of them are very sweet always smiling and take that extra step to make your stay comfortable. The place is amazing in a quiet neighborhood. the swimming pool is clean and well maintained. the flat is well equipped with utensils oven toaster and coffee maker and all sorts of essentials. hosting is their full time job and they are dedicated to it. once we had some problem operating the TV and i messaged Lina on Airbnb and to our surprise paul came to help us within 10 seconds; even in five star hotels they will take more time to solve your query. All the time during our stay we used to come late and leave the place early in morning but there was absolutely no complaint from them paul even allowed us the pool access any time we wanted.
Overall a superb and safe place if you wish to explore toronto or even if you are on a business trip just 15 to 20 minutes from downtown in a serene and quaint neighborhood; anyone will fall in love with this piece of paradise. 
i would definitely suggest this place to anyone visiting toronto and if i go to toronto again this is the place i am going to stay. "
19295487,423272889,2019-03-13,237910999,Christina,Great place to stay. Minutes from subway. Fairly quiet. I was alone with my kids and it felt very safe. Jamie was very helpful.

21440143,368641703,2019-01-07,61579391,Hazel,Great location and very spacious! Only downside is there is no kitchen to make your own food but there is access to a lot of restaurants in the area/ubereats etc. Would 100% go back and stay there
21462204,245278347,2018-03-21,144142751,Eduardo,The best way to describe Kyle's place is to mention that i have wrote a review last month and it still stands because I'm still here in his place and it's simply amazing!
5286926,488061784,2019-07-14,187263021,Peter,Thanks for the nice stay. Everything was as expected. Very clean and cosy. Perfect start for our trip though east of Canada.

31862319,422691803,2019-03-11,243964677,Kameka,This place was exactly as described it fit 6 of us comfortably and the little touches left really made a difference. The building was great clean and spacious and a little booklet was left with a bunch of places around that were in walking distance! It was wonderful to have a secure parking spot as well and the instructions left were very easy to follow for both finding the parking spot and the check in. Would highly recommend this cute spot!

Location is great too."
27113522,355538469,2018-12-04,19000845,Roslyn,We had a great stay at this well positioned downtown condo! Check in/out was a breeze and communication was pretty much instant any time I had a question. The walk to the UP train stop at Union station was 4 minutes. It could not have been more convenient to get to and from Pearson airport! The condo is exactly as pictures portray. Very clean. My only issue is how hard the mattresses are. We used the bed and the pullout all 3 of us found the mattresses very uncomfortable. Other then that the space the host and the location are fantastic.
7226058,68749973,2016-04-06,65211191,Laura,"Monica is an amazing hostess! Such a warm hearted kind girl!
I was in town for a very important career meeting and when my nerves got the best of me she did everything she could to ease my mind and make me feel better!
I 100% must give her some of the the credit for my incredibly successful and life changing day!
Everything happens for a reason and I was meant to stay at Monica's perfect little abode!
I will be back! Thank you Monica for your amazing hospitality!

29929113,485312986,2019-07-10,36520725,Veronica,Don’t let the stairwell scare you.  The apartment is worth the climb.  Great location for getting around Toronto.  The bed is super comfy (if you like a  firm mattress).  Bedsheets were lovely and freshly laundered as were the towels.  Quirky crooks and crannies in the apartment...lots of personality.  Would stay again!

The flat downstairs has everything you need and Liz puts on a great breakfast.

It's a 25min walk door to door to Sunnybrook very easy & mostly flat.
To get downtown it's a couple of blocks to the main road with buses to take you to the subway (takes maybe 45min)."
14694692,271166155,2018-05-31,17125943,Fabiane,"O apartamento é muito moderno limpo e perfeito para 2 casais principalmente por ter 2 banheiros.
Check in e check out fáceis. Vista perfeita do 34 andar de frente para CN TOWER. Roupas de cama e banho novos e macios. Localização não tem igual perto da estação de metrô Union e das principais atrações da cidade. Tem um pizzaria muito gostosa na frente do apto: Boston Pizzaria e ha também um pequeno mercado para compras básicas na esquina. Elevador um pouco demorado mas nada que atrapalhasse nossa estadia. Garagem também muito boa e adequada para quem está com carro! Altamente recomendado!"

15634988,305053053,2018-08-10,155385762,Kayla,It was a beautiful view with a very clean and lovely place to stay. The sliding glass doors make it easy to close the space and when they are open it is a much bigger and open area which was awesome.

Grocery store across the street lcbo too! ;) was overall a great time I would recommend this place to someone staying a few days.

The view really is spectacular and you're steps away from Steamwhistle Brewery Rogers and Ripleys Aquarium. Also just a few minutes from the ferry.  Arthur was very responsive and checked in to make sure everything was good. Parking stall was really convenient. Only downfall was that we weren't able to stay long enough to enjoy the pool and sauna! Thanks Arthur and Kamil!
22595493,349502909,2018-11-17,9324098,Nathania,Benjamin's place was immaculate. I booked it as a place to get ready in for my wedding.

1278781,135130340,2017-03-03,33038380,Kate,Frank is a wonderful host. He went out of his way to make my stay comfortable pleasant and relaxing. I cannot thank him enough for his warm welcome and kindness. He was available for all my queries and easy to contact at any time. The condo location is ideal. It is centrally located but on a quiet side street which ensures that one does not experience the usual cacophony of many downtown condos. It is situated just a couple of steps from numerous shops restaurants as well as public transport. Additionally the condo is extremely well-maintained. It is cosy furnished and equipped with everything one could need for a relaxing pleasant stay.  I slept very well which is always a key sign of feeling comfortable and at ease. I was particularly charmed by the gramophone in the condo and Frank's selection of vinyls.

30954273,508356001,2019-08-12,122030066,Charlie,This was a great place in Little Italy. Coffee shops down the street and just an avenue away from College St which has a great downtown. Big space with lots of creeks and character. Best used as a place to come home to and relax between a long day of walking around and going out at night. I've never seen so many sinks in one place...

6357166,498311351,2019-07-29,63695946,Alexandra,Carla & Dan’s place was just what we needed as a couple visiting Toronto for a fairly long period of time. It was close enough to all the major attractions but far enough away that we could visit more quirky places. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. We had the pleasure of meeting Carla who was so incredibly helpful and lovely and made us feel instantly comfortable. There was also loads of recommendations and even a picnic basket with everything you’d need! We were there during the height of summer and as it is a basement apartment it was incredibly cool and we only turned the fan on once. We can’t say enough good things and would recommend it to any couple looking for a place to stay in Toronto.
27085056,324129986,2018-09-16,28587147,Jt,amazing location and Alejandro is very kind chill and welcoming.  I would stay there again.
7126527,78035854,2016-06-05,33274624,Valerie,I never actually got to meet Patrick but Janet who works with him met up with us and was very accommodating :) They gave us a parking permit for the duration of our stay which was convenient and the place was great. The suite was inviting and perfect for the two of us and looked newly renovated. The kitchen was stocked well with kitchenware that we used to make our own food. The rain shower was also super relaxing after spending time walking around downtown the night before. Overall another pleasant experience staying at an airbnb and I'm grateful to Patrick and Janet for lending us their space :) 
17141204,223602764,2018-01-01,125570778,Chris,Shaun’s place is in great condition and is a perfect size for four people! It is a little distance from the main downtown area but that is nothing an Uber can’t fix.

1638995,152769590,2017-05-18,28893016,Marian,A recent COMPLETE and well thought out remodel everything is beautiful and pretty much brand new. We especially appreciated the Bodum and cast iron skillet man-cave parking and the zen back patio on a fine May day. Clarence is one of those rare people fortunate enough to love what he does for a living and this is what separates his Little Italy property from both of our wonderful previous AirBNB experiences. IMHO SIX stars!!

3271129,27917468,2015-03-15,20885854,Joshua,"My stay with Miriam was fantastic - she was always quick to communicate via email in the run-up to my visit if I ever had any questions.

Both her and Luke were there to greet me upon arrival and they immediately made me feel completely at home - Miriam was even kind enough to give me a tour of the building which made me feel totally comfortable.

The space is really beautiful everything feels modern but also very warm and welcoming. The room itself was great - a super comfortable bed lots of cupboard space and a very handy desk!

Miriam's place is really close to a really bustling scene just outside of the central Downtown area and it takes no time at all to get into the heart of the city to hit all of the tourist attractions.

I would definitely recommend this spot for anybody visiting Toronto - I will definitely be seeking this place out whenever I return!"
15500719,429344003,2019-03-27,865880,Caitlin,Such a great place to stay in the city. Close to everything and has a very home-like feel to it. Great kitchen thoughtful touches and amazing patios. I’d stay again.

7983038,47024128,2015-09-14,2017792,Joana,"Adam ist ein großartiger Gastgeber. Er konnte uns sehr spontan noch sein Zimmer vermieten und hat uns damit sehr geholfen.  Die Lage der Wohnung ist toll. Man ist nicht mitten im Großstadtdschungel aber hat direkt vor der Tür eine Bushaltestelle und die Subwaystation ist auch nicht weit. Außerdem ist ein Supermarkt ein Grocery Store Fast Food Läden und auch sonst alles was man braucht direkt um die Ecke. 
Die Wohnung das Bad und natürlich auch das Zimmer waren super sauber und gepflegt. Das Bett ist zudem überaus bequem :-) 
Adam hat uns abends sogar zu dazu eingeladen mit ihm zu essen. Das ist nicht selbstverständlich!!!  Außerdem weiß er viel über Toronto Kanada und auch den Rest der Welt. Er hat uns unzählige brauchbare Tipps gegeben. So werden wir Orte sehen die wir als normale Touristen niemals gefunden hätten. 
Morgens konnten wir im sonnigen Garten frühstücken und den Eichhörnchen bei der Arbeit zuschauen :-)
Wir können einen Aufenthalt bei Adam nur weiterempfehlen und werden wenn möglich noch einmal zurückkommen!!!

Dear Adam 
Thank you so much for being so nice to us and helping us out!!! We really appreciate that and hope to meet more people who are as nice as you. Take care!!!!"

39051540,573224836,2019-12-05,18312642,Tanya,Perfectly located close to the best shops and restaurants in the city (W Queen West) and my favourite park. Cosy space for one or a couple (that aren’t too tall) that serves as an ideal home-base for exploring downtown Toronto by foot street car subway. Small but well stocked kitchen. Plenty of plush towels and comfy linens. Cable wi-fi lots of welcome touches. I’ll be back!

The flat is well located in a quiet neighbourhood 10mins walking distance from the subway. We booked for three people however the extra bed was a very basic thin mattress. We would recommend but it would be more comfy for two people.

Once I got to the apt I saw it was very neat smelled nice and it was the perfect size for 2 . The balcony’s view was very impressive. So glad I stayed here for a short Toronto trip with my mom. Would def stay here again! The location is absolutely perfect as well everything is walking distance despite the cold   everything was functional and seemed very new. The only thing I wasn’t a huge fan of was the bed which was very firm for my taste but after a long day of walking it was more than fine. Communication was also great ! I also did check out the sauna in the building to defrost from the cold and it was very nice. Really enjoyed my stay here ❤️ thank you Rehan & Martha!!

29300609,420055847,2019-03-05,25373779,Adrienne,My best friend and I planned a few nights to hang out while we were both in Toronto - we had a wonderful cozy stay right in the heart of our old neigbourhoods and a great time walking around trying new restaurants and revisiting old haunts.  After some busy days the apartment was the perfect place to order some dinner and settle in to chat and catch up.  Thanks so much Ben we loved it!

6947407,194791717,2017-09-17,49170697,Ariel,We loved Ben's place! Super easy check in and fast communication awesome location with plenty of great restaurants and bars close to public transportation and off-street parking. The only issue was that it was pretty warm with no AC (we knew this before we booked but didn't plan for the almost 80-degree weather in mid-September). Not the most high-end Airbnb I've stayed in but the location makes it a great value.
18229448,486373307,2019-07-12,236381722,Victoria,Total bang for your buck! Incredibly clean with many thoughtful touches. A bit smaller than what I was expecting but still a great size for 1-2 people. The view was great and the building was quiet and welcoming. Hosts were awesome with answering questions supplying information and responding in a timely fashion. Would definitely come back.

17088112,326550833,2018-09-22,80339945,Sky,The directions to the suit were a bit confusing off the start but once you figure it out it’s quite easy to access the suit. The homeowners let us come to the suit early to drop off our luggage and let us return after 3 to check in. When we arrived to the suit the door was wide open allowing anyone  in the hallway to see directly inside the suit. We returned to the suit at 330 to check in. At this time we found the suit to be in the same condition as it was when we first came to drop off our luggage. The cleaner still had not been to the suit there was wet bedding draped over the furniture in the home causing the fabric chairs to be soak and wet. The cleaner showed up approx. 10 minutes later and cleaned the bathroom took out the garbage cleaned the floors and put the sheets and towels into the dryer. ***cleaned for maybe 15 minutes** The bedding was still wet so we had to make up the beds ourselves once the sheets were dry. This is after we already paid the $60 cleaning fee when booking. Their were not many towels they were ragged looking and full of stains I would suggest bringing your own. The place is very small for 4 people perfect size for 2 people. When we booked we were under the impression that we had access to the amenities gym pool sauna as is described however the key fob does not allow access to the pool. In saying all this you can not beat the location of this condo. Were were a 5 minute walk from all attractions. Also if you need to store your luggage upon check out their is access to a very large storage locker for this purpose this was very convenient and very easy instructions for he storage locker access.
9778801,260068193,2018-05-03,82312233,Candy,The location of the place is ideal for walking to the main areas of the city. However the place was dirty. The couch was stained there was broken glass on the floor which I stepped on. One of the leather chairs was flaking off as well. Looked like everything was bought second hand. There was no parking and the paid parking is about $40 dollars a day. I wouldn’t stay here again.

7673374,337499883,2018-10-16,149135829,Wesley,This is a large cozy room in a beautiful clean house. We were made to feel very welcome and had everything we needed for a great stay. It's in a great area near the beach and with shops and restaurants close by. The nearby streetcar takes you downtown in 30mins. Would definitely recommend staying there to other guests!

The location wasn’t too far from the beach and it was close to grocery stores restaurants etc. Easy to walk around the area. Street cars are nearby as well. Apartment was clean and felt like a “home” which I liked. Cathy was easy to get in touch with. Everything I needed was easy to access and available. There were some nice touches that i appreciated like a hand written welcome note. I would stay at Cathy’s place again :)

18492397,542522803,2019-10-06,252047352,Renee,Loved the view of the CN tower and the water . The street car was in walking distance . It was a walk if we wanted food  or needed to find a pharmacy . Wouldn't deter me from going back  but Would be nice if there was an option to order groceries or have “basics like bottle water “ available in room or in building for a small fee.
11533218,422131304,2019-03-10,241027296,Michelle,I definitely recommend Alper’s place! It was very clean and the view was amazing. The location is convenient and in a safe area. Looking forward to staying here again!

The location was just across the street from the convention center.  There is a grocery store a block away that is open 24 hours.  Close to the entertainment district for dining and shows.

34785213,553184397,2019-10-23,145898109,Johni,This was literally one of the worst places I’ve ever rented on arbnb - first I wasn’t given the address until  30 min before check in at 4pm.  The directions were very unclear and confusing as to how to get to the right building and how to check in. Once we figured out how to enter the secure building the unit was locked.  Entering the unlocked unit was the only way we were to retrieve the key fab to enter the parking garage.  We had to make several calls to the third party management company before they even answered.  We finally entered the unit at 6:00 when our event started at 7.  The unit should not have been rented. The floor boards were raised in multiple areas and were a danger. The blinds were missing on a few windows which made it hard to sleep after sunrise. The worst was the next morning when a cleaning woman barged into the unit and told us to “get the &$7@ out”.  I have never seen such disrespect of personal privacy.  We are requesting that all charges be reversed immediately
17888437,527296930,2019-09-10,53563898,Nick,I've stayed in Alexia's place before and I will stay there again. The location is excellent check in is easy and it is a good value for the price.

119441,93364261,2016-08-12,70431376,Jeff,Denis was a great host. He kindly met us at the home and walked us through the apartment. He was gracious even when we arrived late. Our US cell phones did not have data/service so we could not make contact with him. This is a great place to stay and conveniently located near the downtown area. My teens also really enjoyed having wifi since we were unplugged in the city! Our family of 5 enjoyed vacationing in Toronto and our stay at this clean and tidy apartment.

22250232,279419787,2018-06-20,27391535,Erin,What a lovely relaxing comfortable visit to Toronto. It was our first trip to Canada and Bill’s condo made our trip so much easier and pleasant. I have three kids (842) and the five of us felt the condo was spacious enough for us. We were driving to Toronto and the traffic held us back a bit but bill was very accommodating. Loved having an option to park (additional fee) at the condo. You get 2 parking spaces all to yourself. The condo is very clean. Bed sheets and covers clean. Cleanliness is very important to us and Bill’s condo gets 5 stars. The kitchen was perfect for our family to make quick meals dining table and chairs were great for a family of 5. I wished there were more kitchen pots and pans (one pot one frying pan available) but I was able to make lunches and dinners with ease. The fridge is big and spacious. Walking distance to CN Tower aquarium the Rec and the ferry to the Toronto islands. Amazing view from the balcony of the city and the CN Tower. Everything about the condo was perfect and I am not an easy person to please. I would recommend this place to anyone especially for families.

There were only two of us but the space is large enough to accommodate four comfortably. Very clean close to public transportation and great to have a separate entrance so that we didn’t feel that we were interrupting when we entered or left. Maureen is an excellent communicator and our stay was seamless! Would definitely stay at Maureen’s place again!

1733291,27430541,2015-03-04,7660228,Robin,"Dan: 

Nice apartment but... 

Candour should probably have led you to describe a 2 bedroom apartment with a curtained alcove and a foldout sofa. 

Having used several apartments managed by guys I find a common weakness is changing light bulbs! Three gone. And a little carelessness where feminine hygiene is concerned: hairdryer in each bathroom please...cleanliness behind the corners and under the sofas requires a little more vigour with the cleaning staff. Women property managers seem to get this instinctively.

Recommendation: pay to have a wall and sliding door for the alcove."

Etwas laut über Nacht wegen der Autobahn nebenan also besser Ohrstöpsel mitbringen. Parkplatz in der Tiefgarage gegen geringen Aufpreis verfügbar.

We arrived late (midnight) our first of two nights and Jeffrey was very accommodating - with his instructions it was a breeze to access and we were oh so pleasantly surprised by the bagels coffee juice apples and eggs that were waiting for us!  Our second day was spent exploring the city and it was so nice to retreat here when the day was done.  Apartment is immaculate comfortable and well equipped - excellent value.  We will definitely be back!  Highly recommended.

The one thing the unit needed was a hair dryer.  

As for Check in the check in was not so smooth as the place was not ready at 7pm.  There was confusion when we first arrived had to temporarily stay in a different unit for a few hours then move to the actual unit by 10pm.

That being said Regis was always quick to respond when we needed to get a hold of and did his best to quickly answer any questions or solve the check in problem.

Appartment shouldn't be on airbnb reception said airbnb is not allowed in the building. We had to say we were visiting family."

17712437,280153522,2018-06-22,152438627,Stacy,Our first time with an Airbnb. Easy to find and check in. Conveniently located near the train station made getting in and out of the city a breeze. It was nice to come back from a long day and rest like we would at home.
6955368,291809205,2018-07-16,24919273,Ak,Everything was as described in the listing. The folks who manage this place are very responsive professional and friendly. It's a private room in a shared living space & house and as long as you read everything that is / is not included and have a clear understanding of that the place provides excellent value for money.
33359599,515900302,2019-08-23,53100895,Frank,"Love this cute apartment location in middle of downtown Toronto.
The place was so clean that it made me feel like staying in  brand new apartment.
Checking and communicating with the host was easy.
Termeh was a very professional and great host and responded all my questions patiently.
The location was so awesome in center of downtown.  It’s only Walking distance to downtown airport  lake supermarket restaurants coffee shops Ontario place air Canada centre  and more..
Would definitely recommend to anyone want to stay in downtown."

12454490,76634344,2016-05-28,24439573,Viviana,Our stay at Chris's place has been great! Good facilities (we loved the swimming pool and the Jacuzzi!) very central location and the apartment is all new and furnished with everything we needed! Amazing view on the skyline of Toronto! Definitely recommend!
21579122,547578591,2019-10-15,266210387,Kin Kei,The location & view are great. The place is as the photo shows but kind of worn-out. I was surprised by condo personnel coming into the place one morning for fire inspection and unfortunately I was not notified beforehand. During my 2 week stay 2 unknown males have knocked on my door and one even happend at 6am which scared my girlfriend. I answered the one that happened at noon and the guy claimed he is meeting someone and I checked he has the right address. All these made my girlfriend & I felt worried.
11840922,126991035,2017-01-15,53308414,Marie-Ève,Great view. Overall a good stay. 
23756166,352690154,2018-11-25,50549417,Jemma,It was a great location and the view was awesome. Perfect for a couple.
27783923,327222018,2018-09-23,32456475,Jessy,Que du positif ! Notre séjour étais plus que parfait à proximité du centre ville stationnement intérieur sécuritaire juste du wow et Asha est une hôte très réceptive et à l’écoute 5 étoile ⭐️
5261334,472455917,2019-06-19,45593435,Caroline,This is an outstanding place for a couple looking to be really close to everything without being in the middle of the chaos. The carriage house is set back from a quiet street and sits directly on the park but it’s just one block to Queen St W and Dundas and 2 blocks to Ossington so you can easily walk to everything including the streetcars into downtown. The carriage house isn’t huge but it’s beautiful clean and modern. The high ceilings make it feel more open and spacious. It’s perfect for a couple. There’s also a patio/courtyard area not to mention the entire Trinity Bellwoods park directly outside your door. The parking spot is an added bonus. Jeffrey was also great and very responsive. We will definitely book this place again.

1080121,81718005,2016-06-24,69277869,Marley,My bf and I had a great time in Toronto.  Katy's apartment building was in a perfect for location for everything we needed.  We walked to and from restaurants the Roger's Centre and Union Station.  The view is great.  The ferry terminal was a close distance.  It's nice to stay somewhere that has a kitchen and fridge that you can use to make your own meals.  I love eating out but sometimes it's nice to have breakfast in.  Overall we enjoyed our stay and found the apartment to be quiet and perfect for what we needed. 
16087849,318336316,2018-09-03,58322504,Nathalia,Zak’s place was great. Location was perfect! Right next to waterfrontCN tower Ripley’s Aquarium... - very convenient to walk around as it was close to restaurants and subway stations too. The only downsize on my opinion was the sofa bed that was very uncomfortable but not such a big deal in our case as we were outside of the apartment pretty much the whole day.
20788019,320309126,2018-09-08,100386949,Guillermo Enrique,bonita casa. cuarto muy grande con tu propio baño y closet. los trasporte pasan cerca de la residencial sin ningun problema. facil de moverse. sin duda recomendable

5085314,253454465,2018-04-14,22923396,Kristina,"This was a fantastic place for my colleague and I who were working long days. It's incredibly close to the subway station coffee shops restaurants etc. The only thing I would make people aware of is if you have a car and need to park it you must get a temporary parking permit online from the city. It's very easy to do but you should be aware that you have to do it. Also street parking is at a premium.
We had a great stay!"
23878064,340955156,2018-10-25,25739704,Houston,"What I liked:
- This was a great location for subway and travel to downtown Toronto
- The bedroom is a comfortable private space with AC control 
- Good WiFi
- The place is within walking distance to loads of restaurants/places to eat

Issues I had:
- Up to 8 people can be sharing one bathroom and it does get very congested found myself having to wait for the toilet/shower often
- The kitchen and common areas in the house had a bad smell -- may have been due to people's cooking but it didn't go away for the duration of my 4 night stay.
- Lots of hair all over the bathroom and the bath could have done with a clean
- Found hairs in the bed linen on arrival (Nancy did come and drop off fresh ones when requested)"
5261334,556820339,2019-10-30,56979967,Carina,Bibi and Jeffreys little guesthouse is the perfect getaway in one of Toronto’s most vibrant neighborhoods. Both hosts are lovely people and were always available for questions or a nice chat. The place is very clean cozy modern and feels like a home away from home. The location right in Trinity Bellwood’s park is fabulous. This is without doubt one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed at. I highly recommend!
13928912,250036303,2018-04-03,23082219,Phill,Great place so close to everything all sights / restaurants and cool neighbourhoods on your doorstep. Flat is modern clean and stylish. Would recommend

13849465,241264018,2018-03-08,8757058,Juan,Dev was an excellent host and the apartment was amazing very nicely decorated and good location.
33494191,540445357,2019-10-03,180269067,Clemence,I had the best time at Claire and Matt's. The house is gorgeous and they were both so friendly and wonderful hosts. They were super helpful with local tips of what to do in Toronto and were kind and flexible with my check in and check out times. They live in a really cool neighbourhood which I would say is well worth visiting but also not far from downtown. There's just something extra special about the house that made me feel at home which was lovely in the middle of a long trip. The pets are simply too wonderful for words. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!
38124170,547592040,2019-10-15,22739221,E,This home was amazing. The view was phenomenal and the house was very clean. Jell (the host) and her co-host were extremely accommodating as they helped organize special decor for our trip to celebrate our bride-to-be’s celebration of nuptials. They went out of their way to help accommodate all of my wants offer suggestions and help us with all of our inquiries! The decor was beautiful. The  location was perfect and in close proximity of all the major attractions of Downtown Toronto. Check-in and check-our were easy and the place had everything we needed. Nothing against the host or the apartment just note that the elevator runs a little slow. So factor that into your going and coming and all is well. We would definitely recommend this spot to anybody and hope to return in the future!
3172930,484864342,2019-07-09,123510726,Claudio,Buena ubicación el lugar el limpio la gente es hospitalia y siempre te ayudan.  Mi único punto en contra es que el piso suena mucho al caminar.  Lo demás esta bien.
3905999,21754844,2014-10-23,21533009,Julien,We stayed at Deb and Collie's apartment for 5 days in October. It is an amazing apartment and the photos and description just dont do it justice! Deb and Collie were so welcoming it was a pleasure to meet them communication from the start of booking through to the end of our stay was excellent. I cant say enough good things about our (Website hidden by Airbnb) the apartment they have thought of eveything and made travelling very easy and stress free. Their recommdations for palces to visit eat etc were perfect and made our trip to Toronto even better.......if we return we will defnitely be booking again with Deb and Collie.
28590935,354347483,2018-12-01,68819196,Michael,From initially looking around for a place in Toronto I really thought I found an amazing place. Not until I get there did I realize IT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE EVER EXPECTED! Place is clean stylish has a beautiful view is right next to the Up station (if you're coming from YYZ) and everything is walkable. I can't recommend it enough and will try to book here again when I come to Toronto (unless you book it first).
17559002,547169600,2019-10-14,152364831,Rubens,The basement has all the necessary amenities and is well maintained. The location is excellent. The noise of the host family can be a bit disturbing at times.

19610914,516616564,2019-08-24,224945448,Cindy,Super clean place and hosts promote respect for recycling keeping place tidy and keeping noise down after a certain hour which I am happy to see that respected by all guests during my 1 week stay for a course. Everyone was friendly and polite - super happy about that since my course was intense and needed the tranquility. Their place is also near a public library which I took advantage of as well.
26871586,332573911,2018-10-05,75638319,Jose,Many thanks to Freeda. A really nice place close to the airport.

14371898,302994523,2018-08-06,34686601,Michele,Lovely small efficient but modern appointed space with amazing views of the city. It's in a hip and busy community with high-end shopping and restaurants nearby. Having a car is  a hassle as there is no parking available in the building.  Paid street parking and paid parking garages on the surrounding blocks are available if you're patient and use the parking app. You have access to the building workout facility which was great. Good communication with the host couple. We enjoyed our time in Toronto!
7126527,182433499,2017-08-14,714404,Adam,Patrick's place is beautiful clean and very well situated in the city. The apartment actually exceeded my expectations and Patrick is a phenomenal host. Great food options within a 5 minute walk. Couldn't have asked for a better spot while visiting Toronto.

13174614,105652932,2016-10-02,51462906,Kristina,Weiru was truly an excellent and accommodating host.  She allowed me to check in two hours early and recommended a place to store our luggage after checkout since we had a later return flight.  The location was close to nightlife food and transportation.  The apartment itself was really cute with updated amenities and I felt safe staying there.

Norman responded very quickly to any questions. He was very nice about accommodating our luggage on the last day so that we could pick it up in the evening including a late change we had to make to the pickup time. We definitely hope to stay again!"

11934927,85085793,2016-07-10,35521803,Star,"Calin and Vanessa were warmwelcoming and extremely helpful. The property was exactly as described: clean modern all the amenities nicely furnished nice view into the courtyard quiet nice neighbors great air conditioning (ahhh!) and very walkable to shoppingthe sights food markets restaurants etc.   And a very detailed (and funny!) manual for the unit. Yes it's a bit ""gritty"" (as Calin describes it) when you walk out onto the street but we always felt safe and grew to love the fascinating mix of people languages sights smellsetc. Never having been to Toronto we weren't sure what to expect but had a fabulous and rich experience because of Calin and Vanessa's love for and knowledge of their city.
We highly recommend this property and hope to return. Calin and Vanessa are the perfect hosts-interesting to talk to available when you need them and very respectful of your privacy."
22345053,415371967,2019-02-22,32098037,Rohan,Ezra’s place was very modern and clean. The apartment has all the appliances to make your stay comfortable and the condo building has shared spaces including a nice gym and lounge area.

Very nice guy to shot the breeze with. The property itself is great it had everything you could need. There were 4 of us (guys) and it was plenty spacious and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend it and would stay again for sure.

495303,104175551,2016-09-25,87610266,Michael,"We had an excellent stay at Danny's place. The amenities were very clean and well-stocked with supplies (toiletries bottled water coffee tea...). The place was very nicely decorated and furnished. Danny was available and very willing to help us with any questions or concerns. Something that really stood out to us was that he had prepared a guide of nearby places to eat using public transportation and things to do in Toronto. We would definitely stay here again if we returned to Toronto. 

Five stars across the board."
23840839,246902825,2018-03-26,55804568,Meghan,Johnny's place was awesome! I would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to Toronto. First of all the space was really clean. Johnny thought of everything you could need for your visit. It's in a great location and close to public transit plus the bed was comfortable as well. Johnny was a great host he was quick to answer any of my questions and very friendly.  I will be back for sure! Thanks Johnny for a great stay!

It was very clean and was in a great quiet neighborhood. The hot tub and gym were a huge asset as well as 2 full bathrooms. I really loved this apartment and hated leaving! Jerome also communicated promptly with us and was very helpful. I would recommend the place to anyone.

The unit is spotlessly clean and Abul makes sure to have everything you may need. There was plenty of space for myself my husband and my two sons. We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to the next time.

4020596,448664454,2019-05-05,9711733,Graham,"Steve has a home of aclectic travellers and visitors each with a unique backstory. The house is driven on ecological and spiritual practices and the calm safe vibe comes pleasantly across. The garden shed is nicely separated from the house allowing you as much interaction as you please.

I felt warm and welcome in Steve's home. His was a good place to be.

 Note the bathroom is in the house so you need to walk outside to get there!"
1094362,44453960,2015-08-26,40154109,Emily,Great place! Didn't get a chance to meet Lalo and Beto though they did offer to swing by late but they were kind and accommodating from afar. Just needed a place to stay for the night after a long trip and it was the perfect cozy place to wind down. 
27718731,420394916,2019-03-06,23518413,Fernando Erik,It is a really great place really comfortable; and really warm in winter

27550586,406428370,2019-01-29,99434687,Johnny,Pretty accurate from what was shown. Huan was a great host. You might be somewhat taken aback by the appearance of the neighbourhood and the overall vibe of the building’s basement  BUT NOT TO WORRY it’s safe and a great location if you want to explore Toronto!
15362533,123720100,2016-12-30,104854603,Alexa,"I fell in love with this place just from the pictures. Kevin right from the start was very accomodating and quick to reply. He checked in with us the day before we were to arrive and made sure we were organised and prepared to let ourselves in. He was also very clear that if we needed any help that he was ready to provide it.
Having it be our own private space with a kitchen and living room made it feel very homey. I didn't want to leave the comfort behind when our stay was up. 
It was very clean and they have thought of many details to make a person's stay stress free. Extra toiletries blankets a binder full of emergency contacts WiFi/Netflix passwords and fun things to check out in Toronto. I would definitely stay at Kevin's AirBnB again in a heartbeat! "
33422524,511584226,2019-08-17,109076354,Stephanie,The location of this Airbnb is very convenient and close to many restaurants and stores in the Finch area. The room itself is in the basement of the house and is a super great price for the quality of the stay!  The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The host was very responsive to any messages and even reminded me that I forgot my phone charger after I checked out. Highly recommend!
16251382,448748947,2019-05-05,154179676,Adrian,We stayed with Judith recently and it was been an absolute pleasure. Everything has been nice clean and easy. If I'm ever back in Toronto I'd love to come back!

18475177,523476062,2019-09-03,135575048,Taylor,Peri is a great host very fast to communicate with and was able to accommodate some changes we had to make. She also had some great restaurant recommendations for us! This is a nice place for a few nights stay. It is very close to Kensington market  the eaton centre and the subway. Know what to expect for the price range bed was very stiff amazing it a little hard to sleep and the bathroom had some weird smells. Overall good experience not as noisy as expected and easy check in and out.
21205308,338093569,2018-10-18,62836388,Helene & Antonio,good place.  small and clean. but perfect for Toronto.  super cozy feel and fast communication.  unfortunately the wifi wasn't working which was a big deal because we had an exam the next morning but it's not the hosts fault they obviously can't control the wifi tech issues but it did add a lot of stress to our stay.  They offered us to go use the lobby wifi but this was in a big open space on a different floor.
7750255,319516207,2018-09-06,151735840,Guillermo,"Location location location.
It’s a great apartment next to CN Tower Rogers Centre and a few blocks away where all the Toronto action is: Restaurants Places to visit.
My host wait for me until my arrive (we travel by car from Montreal) and he is very kind."
12609494,351139012,2018-11-21,130753814,Eduardo,Great location close to public transportation. Danilo is a great host and his place is super cozy. I would totally recommend this airbnb.
16193856,558184786,2019-11-02,153449463,Abra,Georgie and her husband were so kind and accommodating. From the moment we inquired about staying in their home they were willing to work with us on any issues we had. When we arrived Georgie even parallel parked my car for me because I couldn't do it! This was my first time staying in a private room (as opposed to having the whole apartment to myself) so I didn't know what to expect but the best way I can describe it is that it's like having relatives in the city who you can stay with (except they let you keep to yourself as much as you want). I'm sure not every private room feels like that but Georgie and her husband make you feel right at home! There were snacks in the room and they offered us to help ourselves to anything in the kitchen. The place was very clean and comfortable and it was well-located too. The street it's on is charming and lined with historic houses. I can't recommend this home or its hosts enough!
28530625,341720417,2018-10-27,217601423,Katarina,smaller than expected but very nice and in a great location!

264319,16482475,2014-07-28,17131484,Brian,This is a really nice large room with a double and 2 single beds and adjoining private bathroom. Shared kitchen is also very nice. Our one-night stay was very quiet and the room has the essentials including flat-screen TV and Wi-Fi. The back patio is small but very nice and private. Would have loved to stay a few more days and explore the neighborhood. This would be a great place to stay if you are visiting nearby Ryerson University a 2 block walk away.
26662976,435465844,2019-04-10,213963751,Michael,Enjoyed the stay and appreciated the parking spot.  Very comfortable bed and loved the fresh croissants.

1202734,58827247,2016-01-05,25234239,Lyndon,I stayed here for new years weekend and had a great experience. The space was small but very comfortable. Very central location near Spadina and College so it's a walking distance from most places. There's a 24h Rexall basically across the street. Brahm was very nice and responded to messages with little delay. Would recommend.
20522806,365770648,2019-01-01,230801152,Chris,This place is everything you need and more!
6702138,498441021,2019-07-29,46770176,André,Maxine and Gary are wonderful. I stayed there for a month with my girlfriend and I felt like I was in my own home with my own family. If you are thinking about being hosted at Maxine's you have to be prepared to receive pancakes in the morning by surprise and fruit pie as dessert all out of sudden or to be invited to a party at her house with her friends. Really believe me when I say that they are wonderful! They are so kind and so great that I felt like they were my parents. They always had some tips or ideas of what to do in the city too. About the house everything is as perfect as the owners everything clean and with a lot of useful appliances. The bed is great the kitchen is pretty much complete and the bathroom is ok also. Gary and Maxine thank you for everything. My stay in Toronto would not be so special if I haven't met you and your house! We will miss you for a long time!
26440800,472860169,2019-06-20,70419399,Eric,We had a great stay.  Anastasia was very responsive the apartment was very well appointed and in a great location for the conference we attended.  I highly recommend.

My parents and I loved it. Murray and Harry were wonderful hosts they communicated clearly and promptly and didn't mind when I made a change to my itinerary. I would highly recommend this spot!
20806050,368228192,2019-01-06,146326112,Celia,For short stays it's a perfect place for you. For extended stays choose one less noisy and expensive.

Check in was very easy and the place was nice and clean. Located in a great area as well! First time in Toronto and I loved the fact that I could walk to majority of my locations. Next time I am in Canada I will certainly look to book again!
1289006,74191974,2016-05-13,16549485,Irene,"Alan was very prompt with his responses and answered all of my questions. Self check-in /check-out was a breeze and his place was exactly as advertised. Clean & tidy. Absolutely no complaints.

13064101,85748634,2016-07-13,12247698,Lisa,The location was amazing! The neighborhood was really great and it was also really easy to get around. So many great restaurants and cute little shops right outside. The unit was very clean and felt very much like home the little patio connected to the bedroom was so great for coffee and breakfast in the morning. We received a nice little packet about getting in parking etc that made everything go very smoothly. Ben was great and ridiculously quick getting back to me! Would LOVE to stay here again!
2843818,19074052,2014-09-06,17682909,Mahfuz,This is hands down the best airbnb I have ever stayed perfect location to see Toronto. This is a beautifully decorated basement suiteand the hosts did a great job of providing helpful information about the area and the city. The neighborhood is very safe and its minutes from the Broadview station so we could get back from downtown within 15 to 20 minutes. The best part was the fact that we could use their bikes no better way to see Toronto than on bikes. We explored all the neighborhoods the beaches and the Toronto islands in just three days. Highly recommend this place :)

3939840,117333031,2016-12-06,15989885,Angie,"Fantastic place to stay in Toronto. 
This accommodation was cozy and toasty warm even for a subtropical Aussie like me who was terrified of a Canadian winter. 
Hosts Derek and Darren stayed up to welcome us despite our late flight and gave us a tour of the lodgings complete with beer and snacks on arrival! 
The location was a great base to explore Toronto from. The streetcar on Queen st. a very short walk South takes you straight into town and a short walk north gets you to Gerrard st with plenty of places to eat. 
This air BnB had everything we could want for our stay and more - we would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Toronto "
21664291,325400445,2018-09-19,202505178,Nina,Sehr gute Lage! Perfekt um (fast) alles in Toronto zu Fuß zu erreichen.
3994370,52831443,2015-11-02,32311551,Maxine,"Oh wow I can't say enough! Elaine and Greg are both phenomenal hosts and each takes a special interest in catering to (and socializing with!) their guests. There's tea and cookies when you arrive communal breakfast in the morning at the main dining table and lots of little touches like personalized welcome signs above your bed. They are a lovely family and just great people to be around.

The lodging itself is pretty bare-bones but in a pleasant way and likely comparable to what you'd find in most good hostels. I slept well on my bed and very much appreciated the ample shelving space available. The basement room sleeps three guests at a time so if you're traveling alone get ready to make some new friends. You know how it goes.

Best perk: The downstairs bathroom. OMG. I wanted to move in there and live in their tub.

Traveling tip: Buy streetcar tokens from Elaine. It's worth it. The house is a tiny bit beyond comfortable walking distance from the downtown center so you'll want to take the Queen or King St. streetcars as much as possible if you're heading to any of the major points of interest. Whatever tokens you don't use she'll buy back in C$ three bucks a pop."

34818077,495120077,2019-07-25,231663931,Kevin,Laura has many well deserved five star reviews. She communicates very quickly and messaged me right after I booked my reservation. Check-in was clear and hassle free. The room (the whole house actually) was sparkling clean with a comfortable bed a desk and towels. Though the house had many rooms available and several other guests there were five bathrooms and three showers enough to accommodate everybody. Free coffee and working wi-fi were a plus. Furthermore the house was in a beautiful neighborhood near several parks and only a seven minute walk from the nearest subway station. I can't recommend Laura's listings enough.
16251382,150237716,2017-05-07,103970740,Quynn,"We had a nice time in Toronto. Even though the weather was so horrible (rained most of the time) but Judith's place is so cozy and comfortable that helped us to enjoy our stay.
The location is very convenient for us to go to any places you want to visit: downtown Toronto Chinatown grocery shopping restaurants.
The house is perfect fit for our family of 5 ( 4 adults and a 4 yrs old baby.) There are a lot of closets in the house and each bedrooms for your stuffs. And beds are very comfy.
I love the kitchen it's very simple but you can get anything you need to cook a family dinner. 
Overall we liked and enjoyed the place. 
Last but not least the host Ms. Judith is very friendly and nice. She 
makes you feel very welcome and willing to help if you have any questions.
Highly recommended!!!"

Falling asleep with CN tower right in front of you and the pano view of the entire downtown. Waking up in the morning I feel like I was in a movie. 
Although it’s central to everything it was hard to pull ourselves out of the unit.  If in toronto this place is a must! Already recommend this place for a friend who’s visiting soon!"

36971649,517562116,2019-08-25,281940138,Alexis,We stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed every second we spent in the apartment. The hosts were very responsive and gave clear and easy to follow instructions regarding check-in parking and accessing the unit. Everything in the apartment was as pictured and the place was conveniently located within walking distance of all of the city's main attractions. The best part of our stay was the unobstructed and up-close view of the CN Tower from the floor to ceiling windows. It was amazing to see the entire city from this perspective and we will definitely try to stay here again when we return to Toronto.

4423410,37649776,2015-07-09,2612079,Christian,I really enjoyed staying in Kevin's loft/condo while in Toronto.  The loft is spacious modern nicely furnished clean and very quiet.

The area around this property is fully stacked with restaurants grocery coffee shops shopping etc. and just an easy 10 minute walk to the water front.

32835782,523883378,2019-09-04,187321413,Miguel,Suzanna is a great host and her property is perfect for visiting Toronto. Suzanna answers very fast any question you might have. The apartment was very clean and stylish as in the pictures. It is located in a very nice neighborhood but in a quiet street thus you can visit different bars and restaurants (walking distance) but also come back a have a good night's sleep. I would definitely recommend this place.

14724836,197125732,2017-09-24,5310073,Johanne,We needed a large home with at least 5 bedrooms. We got that and a ton more amenities... each room comes with its own complete bath ensuite the kitchen is fully equipped. Our family members came from various parts of North America for our son's wedding. It became the Groom HQ where everyone prepared on Saturday morning (23/9). The house was so spacious that everyone could get ready without stepping on each other's toes. I can't complete this review without mentioning the master bedroom which I was fortunate to occupy. I could live in the bedroom without never having to leave! :)
30716789,510069903,2019-08-15,130804644,Guillaume,Anna and Linda are great and professional hosts answering very quickly to any message and accommodating. Location is convenient with easy streetcar access to the city. Streetcars and traffic are very noisy at night and heard from both rooms we didn't sleep well because of that. Living room couch is not suitable for an adult.

29351881,449483849,2019-05-06,104290939,Mayank,Max is a great host and has a good place to offer. He is meticulous in instructions and is running the place well. The place remains clean and quiet. Because the place is not in downtown you will need to figure out ways of transport if you don't have a car. Bus is a good option but make sure to bring exact change else you'll waste money!
4922370,125564413,2017-01-06,60313786,Lane,Great host. Very accommodating.

15397730,123957238,2016-12-31,67664430,Lia,It is exactly as advertised. Excellent location to downtown and waterfront. Uber to Queen and Yonge is about $10. Grocery store is two short blocks away. My kids loved the pool. It's a large lap pool but is clear and warm. If nobody else is using it there's lots of room for kids to play. Building is quiet. 
24542901,315759191,2018-08-29,162678105,Raphael,Thank you Manuel for being a great host. The place was really amazing and I would definitely book the this home again. Thank you!!

31290653,562249384,2019-11-10,307960146,Chenyah,Don't try to get a room here! it isn't worth it and i'm still working on getting a refund! you can smell the mould the bathroom doesn't even have a door! and its shared the bedroom has a big gap under the door so you can hear everything and the neighbours aren't quiet
33547426,470713363,2019-06-16,266572727,Abdul,Great location to spend good time with friends.

The apartment is clean and cozy with a very comfortable bed and is in an ideal location. I would be happy to stay here again.
5668954,458138942,2019-05-25,130038717,Jadyn,Beautiful view from the condo and in a great location for Toronto nightlife. Very easy to communicate with host. Very thin divider in between bedrooms though - this is not shown in pictures.
34333469,484362469,2019-07-08,11584994,Cindy,"Pros: 
GREAT location! There's UP Express train from/to YYZ airport about 25 mins each way. It's literally by the Raptors home court close to Ferry terminal and is about 7 mins from the bus station (bus to Niagara Falls). You can uber/Lyft to anywhere in downtown and there's grocery right around the corner. 
Amenities are good too - nice fitness center with swimming pool. 

Cons:
The curtain was partially broken so you won't be able to take a nap in the afternoon. The bathtub was clogged during our stay.

Overall five-star stay!"
17606372,222787034,2017-12-30,112746243,John,A very well equipped and modern apartment that is ideal for a single traveller or a couple. Convenient location close to the main train station and the metro and also a large supermarket. A great place to stay in downtown Toronto.

39637195,560722964,2019-11-07,217251967,Taylor,Good place the room has two beds in it. There's only wifi but it did smell clean and check in was easy. If just sleeping this is a great place to stay.
16632051,315734057,2018-08-29,2211566,Hillary,We enjoyed our stay at this apartment. Checkin guidelines were clear. Host was super friendly. Just one thing that I didnt like was that the place was old. I couldnt tell that from the pictures. Overall it was clean and had a great location.

There was absolutely no privacy issues with the hosts. The  house (including the kichenette and the bathroom) was very well stocked and the seating area in the backyard was quite comfortable. There was everything we needed for a comfortable stay including extra inflatable beds. Ryan and Julia were quite prompt in answering our queries.  They even allowed us to check out late without any extra cost. Overall a comfortable and wonderful experience.
2807413,15606368,2014-07-12,17689770,Melanie,We had a wonderful stay at Degan's home. It was comfortable and it was located on a very quiet street conveniently next to Yonge street. The neighbors were very kind and greeted me whenever I ran into them. The only problem was the top bunk bed - the light was in the way and made it difficult for me to climb on but the issue was easily fixed with the pull out bed on the couch. If going in the summer I would also suggest bringing bug spray if you plan to go outside; I got several bug bites just walking around the yard and down the street! Would definitely stay there next time in Toronto!

13898341,419683924,2019-03-04,36248733,Esther,Asal was an incredible hostess. In truth I wish she could be my roommate! She is lovely amiable and kind. Her home is beautiful quiet and stylish. I loved the spa gym and bed! The tea chocolate and other small touches were truly heartwarming. I could not have asked for a better place to stay. Asal's place is right next to Chipotle Starbucks the library the mall and so many other places within walking distance. I felt safe and secure as well as comfortable while staying at her place. I definitely will stay there again if I have the chance in the future!
21130811,211628516,2017-11-13,42331448,Kyle,Our group fell in love with this space before we even arrived. Pauline was incredibly helpful and responsive in her communication. When we finally arrived on location we were able to soak in the beauty of neighborhood and the rental space. It was immediately obvious that Pauline spared no expense in decorating cleaning and maintaining the space. Throughout our stay we took full advantage of the proximity to local restaurants and public transportation. We also took comfort in knowing Pauline's assistance was always available. Overall this was the best experience I have ever had with Airbnb and would highly recommend staying here!

21505790,307088015,2018-08-13,76037193,Travis,Very hospitable! The only drawback was that it was semi-private with a mere glass door separating the basement to the upstairs. Aside this minor issue it was a perfect place for us to stay. Thanks Karen! 
18425624,444202627,2019-04-27,237191314,Chuck,"Clean. Close to everything. 
I left my phone charger there and am awaiting a response from the host to let me know if they will be able to return it to me. 
The building is pretty loud alot of banging and street noise but thats Toronto I guess. We were not use to it. 
Overall great place the only part we didnt like was the ""couch"". Its really a fold out bed and it was SUPER uncomfortable to sit or lay on. Otherwise it was a good stay. 
I would say people should defs stay here if youre looking for a place in toronto for a couple of nights!"

24099118,543840172,2019-10-08,60471042,Orla,Calvin’s place in Yorkville was perfect for my stay a very safe building with a concierge. The location is great two subway lines within a 5 minute walk very close to the ROM and many beautiful shops. There is a Whole Foods in the building across the street which was great for grabbing snacks. The apartment is very clean and comfortable not a big space but perfect for my solo stay. Would be tight with more than two people but great for one or a couple I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a spot in the Yorkville area.
2964842,87258445,2016-07-19,22002459,Giulia,Deanna and Hari are very kind and welcoming hosts with a lovely family. They gave us suggestions and help for a very nice staying in Toronto.

She was very attentive and had good suggestions.  I loved the neighborhood. 
6452493,234684168,2018-02-13,67911929,Danielle,Margarida's place was one of the cleanest I've ever stayed at! She greeted us at check in and was extremely hospitable.

The basement studio apartment and separate entrance provided privacy and my own space with all basic necessities. Usman contacted me a few times to check in and see if i needed anything but was not overbearing and I was able to enjoy the space and felt like I had my own place without worrying about interrupting the rest of the house nor was the rest of the house disturbing to me due to the set up. A parking space was provided for me and Usman was flexible with check out. I will definitely return if/when I am in the area again as it fit my needs was no frills and user friendly and advertised as described.

One of the owners was very rude and not friendly.
We had to buy a portable A/C bring our own plumber to fix our bathroom and bring a company to clean the whole house. 
Wifi was awful have never stayed in a house where you had to sign in every time you left the gadget (phoneslaptops) and go back on.
The only thing that was good was the location. 
I would not recommend this house at all. "

It is a relatively large apartment  with everything one needs including lots of little thoughtful extras. A major plus is the washer & dryer.
Why would anyone choose any other place!"

L'appartamento è curato pulito e piacevole (esattamente come lo vedete in foto) e si trova in una zona tranquilla e silenziosa seppur vicinissima a King Street West punto di riferimento della vita notturna.
Consigliato!"
5695073,281746547,2018-06-25,87818036,Allison,Tanya's home is extraordinary a luxurious and totally unique urban retreat. It's like an art museum you get to sleep in. The gorgeous bathroom and the Boudoir bed make you feel like royalty.  Loved the bright and peaceful back terrace after a busy day. The neighbourhood is pretty quiet but close to lots of cafes and restaurants very easy to access everything we needed. Tanya gave us a warm welcome and tour and was quick to respond/help with any questions we had (like where to find good pasta). I will definitely be back! 
28228730,464803774,2019-06-06,260619673,Brendan,This is a nice cozy apartment which lives up to its advert. It is small but I was on my own so it was perfect. The facilities were very clean and amenities like wifi well-equipped kitchen giant TV stereo were nice addons. It is about 10 minutes walk from St Claire's subway station which is fine. The area is quiet residential and there was parking in front of the apartment. Communication with Harry was quick and easy (although we didn't actually meet). All in all I would stay again and would recommend to solo travellers or couples.

I highly recommend! "
3364091,173053369,2017-07-22,124991077,Marc,This home was fantastic!  A quaint neighborhood private parking spot access to the TTC (and therefore all of Toronto) within a few minutes walk.  Corner cafes two parks (with playgrounds and splash pads for the kids) within walking distance as well as a variety of restaurants.  If you can handle the quirks and character of an old home you will be rewarded with this gem!  Our host had the home prepared with all the essentials (plus shelves lined with great books in every room and scooters available for the kids to use for a trip to the park) was quick with replies to any questions we had and provided an extensive list of recommendations for us when we asked...each of which turned out to be excellent choices!  This home was the perfect oasis for us to have slow mornings and evenings after a busy day exploring the city.  It was comfortable close to everything we could want and need and we couldn't have picked a better home if we had tried.
24128201,515241316,2019-08-22,26925085,Haewon,The host is highly responsive

27495034,305583004,2018-08-11,47440499,Harold,Place was not perfectly clean. Lack some basic elements such as bed table. Maybe you can find better value for money.
13738928,185483096,2017-08-21,48757650,Eric,Easy comfortable and clean. Keep in mind all the sleeong arrangements are more or less in one big room.
21378007,475614805,2019-06-24,194728344,Roberta,Slow responses. Lockbox with key is broken. Had to deal with many centipedes & spiders during our stay. Advertised A/C but there's no A/C. Needed a parking permit but was not given info until we were already at the AirBnB. However neighborhood is great & walkable.

9756835,410804843,2019-02-10,238160,Gary,This place was the perfect AirBnb accommodation: clean place quiet location and great value. While I did not need to reach Kyle for anything during my stay his response time was fairly fast and I would certainly stay here again.

17193109,450883569,2019-05-10,28031794,Akshay,The room was in a very nice location close to quite a few restaurants coffee shops and bars.

I'd certainly return again!
6373829,42459037,2015-08-13,9907628,Ramin,Jane was an absolutely wonderful host. She was kind attentive and very welcoming. Her apartment is very charming and has everything you could possibly need for a  comfortable stay. 10 out of 10. Staying anywhere else would be a mistake.

872128,24845912,2015-01-03,12798133,Alexander,"Rahul's loft was exactly as described. I spent the New Year with my girlfriend here and we couldn't have asked for a better location. Situated in gorgeous Liberty Village was perfect for our exploration needs. Further his check-in instructions were precise and easy to follow. The loft was beautifully decorated the beds and couches were extremely comfortable and all of the appliances are brand new. Underground parking and access to the building were great.

Overall it was a perfect airBnB experience and I would definitely stay here again! If you're lucky enough to book with Rahul don't hesitate!"
14685177,343444779,2018-10-31,100865641,Jessie,Brad is a great host and the  apartment is a wonderful place to stay. Definitely recommended!

18993947,217982916,2017-12-10,48560223,Jujhar,Everything was great. Location was amazing. Only issue were with check-in the instructions were a bit vague but a Helen was a quick phone call away to assist us. Only other issue is the unit was on the 51 floor and only one elevator was working to get to the upper floors so we had to wait 15 minutes for elevator  each time we wanted to go up or down.
11531274,400997369,2019-01-13,233349584,Shane,An exemplary experience in all respects.  Lovely comfortable tidy rooms; great neighbourhood; and impeccable hospitality.  Very highly recommended.
13169917,267392402,2018-05-21,20183790,Santiago,The condo could not have a better locatio: it's close to EVERYTHING. Hasan is an awesome host. He responds within minutes to any question always with a practical solution or suggestion. He is incredibly proactive and would contact us on a daily basis to see how everything was going. We will certainly stay at Hasan's place next time we visit Toronto!
20014996,197155910,2017-09-24,72743929,Matthew,Beautiful condo at the end of Yonge Street.  Great condo. Great location. And Goran was great to deal with.
14549970,469369557,2019-06-14,231311062,Vamsi,Myself and spouse stayed in Julie's place for 2 weeks and we absolutely loved it. The place is at the centre of everything in Downtown and most places are easily accessible by walk. The place has all amenities and it's very private. Julie has been super quick in responding to slightest of queries and has helped us settle in. Recommend this place for Julie's hospitality location place and amenities.

6214925,171758190,2017-07-18,102544180,Frances,Thanks so much for a terrific home away from home experience. The kitchen was well stocked the bed was comfortable and the view was wonderful. It was so helpful to be able to run a quick load of laundry when we got there after having toured three other cities. We really appreciated the snack basket too! Matt you are an exceptional host and your home was the perfect retreat after long days touring the city and Niagara Falls. Much appreciated Frances & Doug

9637409,82871781,2016-06-30,36345085,Qi,It was a pleasant stay at Michele's place. All members are friendly and nice. The location is an easy access for TTC and near the beach.  Pizza Thai food are just 5-10 mins walk .  Room is comfortable and neat. Well worth the price for a such good accommodation.
33136454,446041020,2019-04-30,254402425,Park,"집을보는순간 난 소리를 질럿다 
너무좋고서비스시설모든게 완벽했다
그녀는 친절했고 일주일동안 머물면서 나의 대답에 응대도 잘해주었다

22418453,319164625,2018-09-05,37034018,Stuart,Overall good value for money for Toronto and hosts were very welcoming and communication response was very good. Location was abit further out from downtown but easily reachable by bus streetcar or uber. Bed was firm and air conditioning good just like a hotel. However there were some noise issues with guests from next door bedrooms and those in the shared areas. Overall a positive experience for me on my first trip to Toronto.
21814800,282518938,2018-06-27,133569390,Jason,Joe seems like a great guy!
20620905,485325727,2019-07-10,29177297,Carsta,We had a very good time in Brent and Loris House. Everything was clean and Well equiped. The Kommunikation was easy and fast. We are a Family with 3 Boys it was a good Place to explorer Toronto and Niagara falls. Thank you

25737684,479920224,2019-07-01,36139637,Rebeca,"Thank you very much for hosting us.  It was the best decision to stay in Margarette's apartment.  The apartment was SUPER CLEAN whatever product they used was amazing.  
Personally what I loved was the bedrooms in the night when you  turn off the lights the rooms are completely dark I slept so well. 
 The neighborhood was calm and QUIET.  
I loved this place and if I ever return to Toronto DEFINITELY I would like to stay in this beautiful apartment AGAIN.  Thank you Margarette for making our stay so perfect."
19747284,446945455,2019-05-02,8693015,Robert,Good location nice place very convenient check in and communication with the host.  Would use again!
19825694,545544736,2019-10-12,241737977,Bupe Natasha,Lily’s place was great. It was worth what we paid for. The rooms and bathrooms were clean. We had access to the kitchen and were able to prepare our foods and have our meals there as well. We mostly felt we were inconveniencing them at times because they would always give us space whenever we went to use the kitchen. Otherwise you will not regret staying at Lily’s. If I go back to Toronto I will definitely check to see if I can book her before I go anywhere else. :)
1900100,38928920,2015-07-19,31856345,April,The condo was just as described and in a fantastic location.  We were able to park our car and walk everywhere or take a quick cab ride to our further destinations.  Tricia was respectful and quick to answer any questions we had.
4925824,52293801,2015-10-27,47189113,Loc,Johnathan's place was just as described and depicted in the photo which was a nothing less than a cozy  comfortable and quiet little room that was very clean and perfect for my short stay in taking the Canadian medical board exams. I found the location to be superb with Kensington Market nearby a short walk to Spadina (Chinatown) and close enough to University of Toronto St. George campus for my exam.  The place far exceeded my expectations and Johnathan was always quick on returning replies to questions and gave great advice of what was nearby. I would love to stay here from now on every time I frequent Toronto and highly recommend this cozy place for any traveler in need of a centrally located place for a great price.
16734184,438772853,2019-04-17,225787887,Anel,"Dev’s apartment is in a really nice area in downtown the entrance is very convenient and Dev was very nice. 
There are some details they have to be worked on and there is a construction in front so there is some dust but I think it is a good choice for the money you pay."
24225998,502250578,2019-08-04,134740847,Samantha,"The stay was overall great. Really enjoyed the location and the balcony. The building itself is stunning. There is a pretty awesome rooftop pool however our last day it was closed down due to someone throwing glass into it so it’s not the fault of the host by any means... just disappointing. The hot tub was also empty... and then our bathtub wouldn’t plug so we were unable to even do that. The host was very nice even set us up with VIP to a local club. 
If you are someone who tends to get loud past 11 this isn’t the place for you. The people who live here full time are pretty sensitive to noise. 
Overall I’d stay here again!"
33757579,457215872,2019-05-23,258462504,Paul,Dang is a super Host. He is very friendly and a great cook too. If you are lucky he will do a great meal for you. Accomodation is as shown in the pictures. I can only recommend it to you.
25508000,556086006,2019-10-28,239022388,Chelsea,This was a great stay. Yani was very communicative and available if we needed anything. The location was perfect everything we wanted to do in the city was walking distance. We brought a car but we ended up just parking it in the building garage and didn’t use it again until check out. The airbnb is small but I live in DC and I know how city apartments are. They’re all smaller than they look in the pictures but it was still super nice and functional! The only complaint we had was about the window in the second bedroom; either we couldn’t figure out how to close it or it was stuck open. Also this is a building problem but the elevators are pretty finicky. They worked fine for most of our stay but one day only one of them was working so we had to wait a while whenever we were coming or going. Other than that it was wonderful!
23933487,263272046,2018-05-11,94617659,Taoufik,"A+ 
Great location :) Very close to downtown and public transit with a lot of free parking around the place.
Aj is always available to answer all the questions (Via emails/texts/calls and  in person). I really enjoyed my stay. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Toronto."
15479868,508910071,2019-08-13,154399816,Jesse,Talha is a nice and welcoming host who does his best to accommodate guests. He's effective and helpful when we communicated during my stay. The place is great in location and provides everything a traveller would need. Highly recommend.
28467651,458824478,2019-05-26,259023078,Leon,The area that the AirBnB is located in is a quiet neighbourhood. Parking is often more than enough considering the size of the driveway and the interior itself is spacious enough to accommodate at least 4 guests per room. There are also more than enough washrooms meaning you won't have to fight with your roommates in emergencies.
14662932,264699864,2018-05-14,118861318,Rachel,"Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour chez Mike et Vanda l'appartement est très propre et vraiment joli bien décoré avec beaucoup de goût. C'est très bien équipé et une place de parking est disponible juste devant la maison. Les transports en commun sont aussi juste à côté. C'est un quartier résidentiel calme et agréable. 
La communication avec Mike et Vanda est bonne ils sont réactifs et répondent de suite si nous avons des questions.
A recommander super expérience !"

2969462,106687408,2016-10-07,56091725,Yalini,Annie and her husband met me in in the lobby and made me feel very welcome and well informed. Communication was fantastic although not much was needed as everything was already provided for and nothing went wrong during my stay. The apartment is modern very well maintained clean and has all the amenities you would need. It's perfect for one person or a couple. The location is excellent its near Union Station and within walking distance of many sights restaurants bars etc. There is a free shuttle from Billy Bishop Airport to Union station which is a short walk to the apartment. Overall a great experience.
23878064,495110967,2019-07-25,52341583,Gaelle,Séjour agréable malgré la propreté des lieux
10811863,294811870,2018-07-22,58454539,Simone,Charles' apartment is situated really well. It's a very nice safe building. The apartment itself is on the 29th floor with spectacular views. Nice interior and amenities. Use of pool and whirlpool. Perfect for two but also easily slept the four of us looking for a safe over-night with parking. Would recommend and come again any time! Thank you Charles!
14806985,162180436,2017-06-19,96108931,Anthony,This is a chic pad. A great base for a city adventure. Perfectly situated. The bathroom alone is enough to my me want to rebook! Highly recommend
1100282,49471937,2015-10-04,201460,Amy,From the moment I booked Sun's place she was very responsive and communicative. Check-in was smooth and the place is seriously perfect a real hidden gem with a full kitchen a lovely backyard and plenty of space. It is also very peaceful while being located just blocks from Bloor West and Dupont two subway stations and Christie Pits park. And although we didn't meet Sun we felt very welcomed by all the little notes and goodies around the house for guests. We had no doubt that if we'd have needed her at any time she would have been there. It was a shame that we couldn't stay longer but we will definitely be looking to book here again the next time we are in Toronto. 
30745612,563985497,2019-11-14,228585928,Tyler,Great place with a great view
27289776,314391043,2018-08-26,172830011,Jacqueline,Fereshte's place was beautiful and clean. Having a place to park was awesome and there were thoughtful things throughout the apartment. Lots of great places to eat in the immediate area and very close to downtown. I would definitely stay again.

I would always choose her place over every hotel in Toront!"
18792060,356272748,2018-12-07,2247592,Sam And Dushi,Leon's apartment is a great base for a stay in Toronto - it's close to multiple streetcar lines and walking distance to the subway and many of the city's attractions including the distillery district and the scotiabank arena. Check in was easy the apartment was really clean and felt spacious for three of us.  We would definitely stay here again!

Thank you. Excellent location and fantastic views."
14106058,284986025,2018-07-02,7654532,Carole,Loved staying at Maria's space.  She made it easy communicating with us about check-in asking if we had questions even when she was traveling overseas.  There was fresh milk in the fridge and lots of maps to consult for activities nearby.  We especially loved the location:  this flat is at the intersection of two different and interesting neighborhoods and we managed to explore both in the time we had.  We will be back!
10354275,331771292,2018-10-03,144886800,Pablo,Great space and location. I strongly recommend.

18962291,551620385,2019-10-20,128458221,Yonghui,别墅的位置在渥太华东部离Niagara Falls要开大约两个小时左右｡由于这个区域道路原因别墅不是特别好找｡整个别墅内部新收拾干净｡楼下一个卧室楼上四个卧室最多可住十几个人｡一共有三个卫生间一楼一个二楼两个｡房屋使用说明很详细有中英版｡房东人很好出问题立刻来电话解决还随时提供路况信息｡有免费饮用水一箱放在厅里｡总之是一个不错的地方哈｡

Not on the beaten path by any stretch which just means you have a little further to walk to public transportation or nice-ish groceries but there are some very good restaurants not too far from the house which was great.

16795828,240863039,2018-03-06,55154785,Oliver,The studio is beautiful and as it is described in the pictures. The unfortunate and not entirely in the host’s control was that cockroaches appeared around the kitchen and bathroom area at around 11pm. This affected my sleep dramatically and I ended up with a couple hours of sleep before a big presentation the next day. Since the studio is in an old warehouse/industrial building it certainly has character but for me the pests were a showstopper. I told the hosts the next morning and they immediately refunded my stay and I checked out a day earlier than expected. What I saved there cost me in change fees to my flight because I just wanted to go home and sleep.
26565222,419268572,2019-03-03,64377502,Kevin,"Maria is very efficient and is ""less is more"" personified lol . She accommodated my stay even when my flight arrival time was delayed. It took no more than 1 attempt or reaching out for her to answer texts/phone calls promptly. 

Her place is as pictured. She gave me my privacy and access to the main bathroom of the house w/o any type of interruption. Also there wasn't any noise level to worry about as I could get a good night's rest and work on work stuff throughout the night.

I recommend her place if you're staying for 2-3 nights for sure. Such a great lobby for Uber and/or Lyft pickups Incredible and personable guest services especially when I had issues (U.S. cell phone roaming conversion) connecting to Airbnb app to contact Maria to let her know I arrived -- the gentlemen up front were completely understanding. Lastly a 10-12 min ride to the airport and about 15+ mins to downtown Toronto crazy convenient."

20946133,326530613,2018-09-22,214419355,Sidi,"Jenna's place was really nice. Easy check in. Very nice host. The place was very clean and comfortable. Right next to buses and street cars.
Keep in mind it is a basement apartment so sounds from upstairs tend to be magnified and as she stated ceilings in certain areas are low.
Overall great place would stay again."

Localización genial en un barrio céntrico lleno de restaurantes y tiendas de todo tipo. Además hay una boca de metro a dos minutos.

El apartamento esta muy limpio es espacioso para dos personas y la cama es cómoda.

Los anfitriones contestan muy rápido a cualquier duda y se adaptaron a nosotros para organizar la llegada.  Además si necesitas cualquier recomendación sobre la ciudad te la darán encantados.

Muy recomendable repetiría sin dudarlo!

Great location clean and comfortable apartment and amazing hosts. 

Highly recommended thanks to Chris Tom and Miki!"

1100282,20100665,2014-09-23,20377176,Ginelle,Great neighborhood great place! Really nice additions such as soaps/water/snacks that made it special.

4719564,504930559,2019-08-08,624932,Tom,Andrew's place was great! Great value perfect location for our visit to House on Parliament a favorite restaurant of ours. Comfy bed- would stay here again. We never met Andrew but his partner was very nice.
1820689,17091184,2014-08-07,1273865,Nancy,A few girlfriends and I came down to Toronto for a week to visit and chose Daniels place... We fell in love with it! It's very spacious and perfect for 4 people. Although we never met him in person he would always follow up on us every other day to see if we needed anything. He actually cared to make our stay as comfortable as possible. I felt like a rock star living here. It is very central and a safe area not too far from all the cool places downtown. I highly recommend staying here and his place made our trip that much more fun and exciting. I would stay at this place again if i ever decide to visit Toronto again. Thank you so much Daniel! The hardest part was returning the keys :)
28588349,493590202,2019-07-22,261457208,Gurpreet,Very neat and clean. A great experience for living.
9759098,299771689,2018-07-31,178762628,Shaikhah,Great location fantastic view spectacular condo and a great responsive host. Will definitely consider it again.
39488567,563754909,2019-11-13,230276441,Shegufa,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4202456,26698435,2015-02-17,16092532,Eric,Very nice place.  Easy to get to from the major hwys. Easy to get public transit.  Parking although not provided was easy to find.
8536724,353336687,2018-11-27,22705285,Mohamed,The stay at Leon & Patrick's was very nice and smooth. Good location and very nice and Xmasy home. I had the chance to chat with Leon a lot and he was always nice and talkative and accommodating to my caffeine addiction and they have the cutest dog I've ever seen.
27405406,337527205,2018-10-16,21884410,Lynda,We had a great stay in Rodney’s place. The house was perfect for us and lovely and clean. If we visit again we’ll definitely stay here.
15132324,220704675,2017-12-23,1439421,Sorin,They are very welcoming hosts. The house is very clean and the bed is comfortable. It’s like a home away from home. I recommend staying here I will come back again.
7583417,468026429,2019-06-11,14618599,Andrea,Judy and Don’s flat is really comfortable and clean. I totally recommend it!
6834011,47076281,2015-09-15,34301999,Takumi,"Hanan & Johnathan were wonderful hosts. Especially giving us their advice for things to do in Toronto. 
Our room was super comfortable and we totally felt welcomed and relaxed during our stay. Location is great and very close to great food and all major attractions in downtown. "
31645057,562346898,2019-11-10,3485355,Bonnie,close to lots of amenities. Great victorian home loved those pocket doors going into the super huge master bedroom!
28784497,455444383,2019-05-19,41807051,Jessica And Adam,Great place that worked beautifully for our extended family to come and visit the grandparents in the area without needing them to worry about hosting. As pictured and great back yard that our kids put to good use.
30952918,526184923,2019-09-08,164236193,Melvin,Really great place and nice location dt with your privacy
38626579,545508356,2019-10-12,13469497,Kay,Great location walking distance to everything. Very neat apartment with all the amenities including onsite washer and dryer. The condo entrance fob sometimes didn’t work but hopefully that’s temporary. Thanks Ak!
27052799,498982079,2019-07-30,4815894,Alex,We liked the location a lot as my parents had to fly out of the nearby airport which mainly serves Portage airline. It was pleasant to watch the planes arrive and take off and the boats in the harbor from the balcony. Only a couple of people can fit out there comfortably though. In general we found the place sufficient for 3 people.
10771597,174343251,2017-07-25,101188781,Adam,The  best thing about the apartment is that my kids and I after a trans-Atlantic flight could easily walk there from Union station. On other days we walked to and from the CN Tower and down to the lake via St Lawrence market.
19863568,564684427,2019-11-16,44424751,Valete,I had a wonderful time staying at Jeff’s apartment! Super clean and comfortable! Amazing location as well right in the heart of downtown Toronto. I also enjoyed the convenient in-building wellness center. Check in and check out were smooth. I would definitely stay again if back in town.
21188111,247178100,2018-03-27,29063800,James,"Great condo very modern awesome location.
Host was a pleasure to deal with. Fast responses and accommodating to requests. Went above and beyond. 
Highly recommended!"
3626587,32694431,2015-05-20,18223962,Corey,"Jason was an incredible host. He was very responsive with emails both before and during my stay - including suggesting restaurants and things to do. He was very friendly and helpful. 
He emailed me a number of times to make sure I was doing well.
Apartment was exactly as described."
26966826,367755322,2019-01-05,10902088,Kimberly,Beautiful stay at the Annex! It was close to everything we needed had a wonderful stay.

1564999,100956914,2016-09-11,31673940,Marc,Samantha was very responsive and helpful the accommodations are great!  Beautiful house very clean and everything we needed.  It was nice to spend some the in a neighbourhood (Leslieville) which we never had before.  Great shops and restaurants and the perfect distance from the noise and action of downtown.
21697604,467663900,2019-06-10,179879348,Rachel,Loved this place! Once you find it ( (Hidden by Airbnb) maps struggles in the area) it’s a great location because it’s close to anything downtown and the subway is super close. The place was very clean and tidy and we had zero issues.
34466169,466622452,2019-06-09,17562198,Jared,Place is a bit cozy but sleeps four comfortably. Walking distance from nightlife on King Street and only a few blocks from Queen Street and Chinatown. Close to downtown. Easy check-in and check-out.
15769848,449793987,2019-05-07,8238590,Danielle,The location is perfect for attending a meeting at the convention center. It really could not be better. The host was very responsive to when I reached out about some issues with bathroom lighting and towels when I arrived. Note that keys are picked up and dropped off two blocks away and the doorperson is quite reluctant to let you leave your luggage at the front desk. They allowed me to leave it but refused to be responsible. I couldn't stand to walk 4 extra blocks with my heavy luggage again so I took my chances. There are A LOT of airbnb guests staying in this building and there is often a bottleneck at the elevators. The apartment overall is mostly clean but it's spartan and bachelor pad-esque with IKEA furniture and no character.
2666562,50079557,2015-10-09,31844325,Rong,Very very nice place to stay. My family had good time in the house. Impressed by the fully equipped kitchen. My daughter also loves the piano in the living room very much. 
17637352,198206902,2017-09-28,53902475,Gemini,Ava’s townhouse is just amazing in the middle of everything but very quiet very fashion and modern decorated. From the details of everything we could see the fabulous taste of the owner. We would definitely recommend any family live here .
32083529,442034859,2019-04-22,18673693,Ernesto,"Excellent option.

27892482,324199790,2018-09-16,190323346,Daniel,Great loft with a lot of personality! Great location to explore the city. Very much enjoyed my stay. Aftab is great for providing information and is quick to respond to messages. Well worth the price.

29703329,446085347,2019-04-30,22610765,Smriti,My stay was great! Renata's place is very clean and is exactly as mentioned in the description. The kitchen is well-stocked and they give you a lot of freedom around the house. The place is at a 10 min walk from the subway station and there is a bus stop right outside the lane. Good collection of grocery stores/eateries close to the house. They also have 2 dogs who are very friendly!
29060586,562136545,2019-11-10,108360138,Nick,A terrific place! Bede is an exceptionally kind and caring host who was more than willing to go above and beyond for us. The space is great value for anyone coming to the GTA. Will definitely stay here again!
29945949,438358892,2019-04-16,249292333,Linoi,Very clean with a amazing view. Quick response with my questions with no problems.
14470756,98821944,2016-09-02,448788,Casey,"My wife 6mth yr old and I stayed here whilst visiting family in the area.  Kristine and Peter were so helpful in making our stay better. They were super responsive gave some great local tips and we borrowed a port a crib feeding chair and even some toys which made our stay so much easier.  

The space itself was great the bed super comfy the bathroom great and the kitchen well appointed. good Wi-Fi too.  It was the ideal place for our week long stay."
11683303,547230841,2019-10-14,34424179,Laura,We had a Nice Stay at Nike's place. There is another renter on the other side of the appartment. Everything is very clean and organized. The private bed+bathroom are big and Nice for a couple like us. There is airconditioning and heating which was Nice. The window of the bedroom is on the streetside. Sometimes you hear the traffic on the streets but its not bothering. The location is close to a few supermarkets and near Kensington market. Thank You again Nike!
30044684,446472360,2019-05-01,243872307,Egnis,"Apart from the location clean apartment equipped with everything necessary and the convenience of moving around the city very easy from Ro's place the component which made my stay enjoyable was precisely Ro. :)

She's an exceptional person which cares about her guests and was supportive and helpful since before my arrival and for all the rest of my stay. She would always answer my calls or messages and help me everytime I needed. She makes sure that everyone feels home there and she does it perfectly.  It was strange leaving this place after all this wonderful experience I will miss that time. In the end I made a great friend of her.

Thank you Ro :)"
10121791,165692629,2017-07-01,122459700,Alain,With two bedrooms it was perfect for my wife my two teenagers and me. Great location: close access to subway and streetcar. At 5 minutes walk from a Loblaws and a LCBO (both located in the Maple Leaf Gardens). Rooftop terrace in very nice and calm. James our host was very helpful and welcoming. It is a confortable downtown condo and coffee is good. Highly recommended.
16930242,219892572,2017-12-19,75497294,Luc,Sandra and her family are very welcoming and respectful of their guests. It was my first Airbnb experience and I was pleasantly surprised. It felt like a small quaint hotel (auberge). Plus the neighborhood is super well located close to everything but just off the beaten path enough to be tranquil.
28081569,565470704,2019-11-17,119594000,Megan,"Awesome space great location. 
Grabbing a temp parking pass from the city let us park right out front. 

Definitely recommend staying here."

14874815,177678037,2017-08-03,64988099,Natalia,Apartment is good really nice area. Good contact with host. Wifi was slow and bad connection. In conclusion is really good place for travel.
37663988,547110559,2019-10-14,198185440,Yumi,전망이 너무 좋았고 시내 중심가에 있어서 이동도 매우 편리했습니다.
13523146,241550505,2018-03-09,164866448,Ray,Daniela's place looks nice in photos but is even better in person.  It's evident that she cares a lot about hosting as she's placed a lot of attention to such minor details as amenities and design all of which contribute to providing a comfortable stay.  One would be hard pressed to find a better experience even at a nice hotel.  Daniela is also extremely responsive.  Thanks for being a great host!
15616432,486425039,2019-07-12,146395732,Eva,Adam's place is a 10 minute walk from the Eaton Centre and 16 minute walk to St. Lawrence Market and 30 minutes to Chinatown.  It's a central location but there's a bit of sketchy people hanging around the area.  I believe my Uber drivers told me the reason is due to the homeless shelter health/mental/drug center nearby.  Honestly they do not bother me as I was with my family but if I was a solo traveler then I will be a bit wary walking back at night time.  Anyway Adam is a great host.  Great communication. If I'm in Toronto again I will book again.
30187614,535119763,2019-09-23,166886224,Steven,Good place for just sleeping and showering (at least for me). It was very comfortable.

27460918,350589020,2018-11-19,29225777,Jm,This is a spacious clean modern apartment in a great location. Quiet neighbors. Very decently equipped kitchen- I made nearly all my meals there during my stay. A very comfortable easy stay.
21828838,346415344,2018-11-08,211565963,Kay,The flat is actually just as great as depicted in the pictures if not better! The kitchen is FULLY equipped. Location is truly convenient - 10 / 15 minutes walk to the train station (bus stops much closer). Restaurants and shops all in very close proximity. Communication with the host was great. I would definitely stay here again
9544647,66546680,2016-03-23,61469686,Edreen,Alina was a great host! Communication before and during the stay was great. She made all the arrangements for the check in and check out to go smoothly and also checked up on me once I was settled in. The place was exactly as described and looked exactly how it was in the pictures. Overall it was great experience thanks to the excellent communication with Alina she was just a text away if there was anything I needed!
12751535,157375517,2017-06-03,21462309,Jordan,"Great place if you are looking for a place to sleep for the night.  There is no kitchen to use though there are quite a few places to eat in the area.  The walls are thin and you can hear the other guest from the rooms beside.  The setup is more like a dorm style.  It is a bit loud with a barking dog and running water from upstairs.

Overall a clean comfortable place and bed to stay the night."
21155758,237343941,2018-02-22,89771512,Kaydene,"Please be aware that there is a very noisy family upstairs and the floors are wooden so the noise constantly comes through at all hours of the day. She had two kids one of which frequently yells expletives @ her. Also there is constant marijuana smoking up there so expect some secondhand inhalation. We complained to our host who offered us a space heater so that we could close the air vents connecting us but even then the smoke still seeped through.

I must say that Andrey was a very nice guy. He was always quick to respond and very helpful. For example he always shoveled the snow take out the garbage and put salt on the pathway in a timely manner. It's very unfortunate that his upstairs tennant is ruining the stay for his guests.

Also the neighborhood is nice quiet and very convenient to downtown."
14948553,146790997,2017-04-23,4453856,Nick,Good location simple room very nice hosts!

5813814,448681569,2019-05-05,242745229,Jeff,Ruth was absolutely amazing! She was intrigued by what myself and my other guests do for fun and as jobs. And was extreamly sincere and accommodating. I would highly recommend staying with her!! Also a big starwars fan :p
18024250,144824580,2017-04-16,55201501,Elyse,Frank's place was great. Central to friends in Toronto I was able to get around easily. Also adding a second traveller was simple. We both enjoyed the accommodation.

12042727,206937127,2017-10-27,35597592,Manu,WARNING: This place is BETTER than it seems in this posting. Add to this that Neil and Kim were very responsive to messages the check in process was a breeze and the small niceties (thank you Kim) and you’re looking at what is likely one of the best Airbnbs in Toronto if not Canada. It’s difficult to describe how awesomely central this location is you’ve just gotta experience it. Starbucks is literally around the corner along with ultra cool places to eat and hang out nearby. Will stay here again no question.
33293296,484777374,2019-07-09,156117539,Daisy,This place was advertised as it is! It’s conveniently located at the center of downtown Toronto! Almost everything is walking distance food  groceries places of interest shopping! The place was clean and nice. We had a little problem with the wifi but was resolved. And it ran out of hot water the first day. Other than that I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore downtown Toronto!
34614637,504432996,2019-08-07,280070556,Bob,Nice modern clean and perfectly located to take in all what Toronto has to offer. Will be back.
7834160,446889915,2019-05-02,53934480,Kim,Great spot in Little Italy. Walking distance to many great restaurants and sites! It was our second time there and it worked out perfectly for us.
15806052,125970963,2017-01-08,100588800,Monica,Tanya & Vitaly are hospitable & respond quickly. The apartment was set up with a handwritten welcome note & bottle of wine which was so sweet :) It's a great place w/a gorgeous view of the city. The parking was a breeze & check in/out was no problem. We definitely will stay again!

32156037,498909247,2019-07-30,324823,Simon,Very much enjoyed staying at Jeff's Airbnb. Clean quiet and well located with quick transport by streetcar to downtown and Torontos best Museums and galleries.
38521593,536399442,2019-09-26,297735980,Carl,You get a room to stay in and pretty much you can enjoy the amenities or go tour around downtown with the amazing view.
21835119,507463630,2019-08-11,159998448,Erik,We had a great stay at James’ place. The space is very open the decor is really nice check-in/out is super easy and James was very responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend staying here.
27192205,478145192,2019-06-29,158231296,Sandra,"Eli’s basement apartment was adequate for a stay of 2or 3 days. It is spacious and the two “army style” cots are comfortable enough for sleeping for a couple of nights. The AC was very welcome as it was quite hot in Toronto during our stay but cool in the apartment. 
All in all it is pretty good value for the money however there are some negative detractors which should be mentioned.
While listed as an Air Bed and Breakfast it is very difficult to make breakfast at this place. While there are a couple of small pans there are no cooking utensils making it all but impossible to cook breakfast. While there was instant coffee provided along with powdered creamer there was no coffee maker. The lack of a toaster or bread knife made it even more difficult for making breakfast. 
If one wishes to book Eli’s place one should consider bringing basic cooking utensils and a toaster."
27481400,516670689,2019-08-24,36483564,Savannah,we had a great stay! we drove our own vehicle to utilize the included parking and you definitely need a second person to be your navigator and wait in the car to run up and get the fob. the building felt safe and secure and had a security desk which was reassuring. the neighbourhood was friendly and bright with a grocery store and tim hortons across the street. there were 5 of us so one slept on the pull out couch no problem. we will definitely be booking again if we go to another concert!
1886850,75770587,2016-05-23,63516714,Sloane,Great little spot tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. Donna provided everything we needed for our stay and gave great recommendations for nearby amenities.
908807,5183029,2013-06-17,1388352,Ethan,I came to Toronto for a conference. Jodi was extremely helpful even before I arrived connecting me with running events in the area and generally helping plan some activities. She had plenty of recommendations and is really passionate about her city. Her apartment is in The Danforth neighborhood a place with great restaurants and a lot of activities. It also has plentiful public transportation (subway streetcar) minutes away. The view is incredible from the apartment. I would highly recommend Jodi and her apartment for a great stay in Toronto.
15239234,198513057,2017-09-29,146597189,Hlynn,"This exceptionally clean and comfortable unit was perfect for my spouse and I during a conference in downtown Toronto.  Thick fluffy towels crisp clean sheets and a kitchen to cook in made me one happy guest!  

Laura was quick to respond to questions and was good enough not to laugh when my clothes got ""locked"" in the dryer (helpfully suggesting that I open it from the left instead of the right).  Next time I'm in town I'm heading straight for Laura's place!

For anyone heading into the downtown this unit is close to tons of bars restaurants unique shops the Convention Center subway lines and even a Loblaws and a couple of Shoppers and Dollaramas.  There's even a park close by for picnicking."
33873130,452601836,2019-05-13,244574192,Sabrina,This place is exactly as it looks on the picture. The appartement is very well located clean and quiet. Kelly and Andrew are quick to respond to messages. Will definitely stay here again!

13788215,199662111,2017-10-02,136126604,Die,It is a nice condo right outside of downtown Toronto. There is a bus take you straight to downtown and comes very often. The condo is spacious and clean. The neighbourhood has lots of restaurants and a big supermarket. The check in and check out process was easy and well explained. Tenya is very responsive and nice. Overall I would definitely come back the next time I go to Toronto.

Highly recommended as the unit was super clean when we arrived and it was very quiet at night to rest. Free parking was a huge plus!

This was my first time ever using AirBNB and im excited to keep travelling with it because of the outstanding service and hospitality Sean provided simply because it comes naturally. I felt very welcome in his home and I cant wait until I can revisit.
18346645,450539017,2019-05-09,112023989,Ian,Location Location Location! Stephanie’s place has the whole city of Toronto at your fingertips! The apartment is a great place to lay you head after a long day of exploring the city or relax and have a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. We recommend her flat highly and will definitely be back soon!

17802438,351686045,2018-11-23,27871032,Leslie,Ela’s condo was ideally located and extremely well appointed and very clean. The internet was awful and problematic as I was hoping to do some work while I was there.  if this is not important for you this spot would likely work well.  Better wifi would make a huge difference. The only other issue was the lack of ability to control the heat.  Ela did send someone but We could still not get it cool enough for our liking. Apparently the heat and A/C run on the same ducts so in the winter only heat.  Really lovely condo otherwise and superb location.
29383718,512799988,2019-08-18,67753283,Maddy,Great location.  Close to all attractions for sporting events and concerts. Very clean. Fast response when we had questions.

2296506,355356564,2018-12-03,211789946,Leila,In this apartment  you will feel at home away from home especially with regards to the facilities and the location.
13224752,529309328,2019-09-14,126810896,Hilal,I just stayed one night but everything was okay. Clean bed clean towel room looks just like in the pictures. It‘s a bit far from the city center. I can just recommend it. A little hint for European vistors like me: Take an adapter with you otherwise you can’t charge your electronics no adapter availabe in the room :) Thank you Summer!
20066462,236095928,2018-02-18,103273243,Jenny,David was such a great host along with his wife! My sister and I stayed at this place for the first time and it was outstanding! The place was super clean and just as accurate as in the pictures! Very quiet and yet so comfy! I would definitely come back and stay again!
25031038,536413236,2019-09-26,3836760,Andy,You get what you pay for. I booked the place for two different guests visiting Toronto. One thought it was OK and one hated it and refused to stay. It is pretty  small and there are a few other guests you share bathroom and kitchen with. Its a good price for the area as long as you know what you are getting. Possibly 'cosy' is not a synonym for 'tiny'. But when I contacted the host and said my guest refused to stay there the host immediately offer to issue a refund.  Obviously a host who cares about customer service. Very responsible and much appreciated. AirBnB Support who helped me find another location  still nitpicking and trying to find excuses about covering additional costs incurred by my guest while switching to new place
23222479,238345597,2018-02-25,172941180,Bert,Great place to stay! As advertised sleeps 4 people with no issues. Wifi works great and has a private entrance with pass code. Thank you for hosting us Jamie!
6064716,144819625,2017-04-16,6673171,Pablo,I had a great stay. The bedroom was very comfortable with a lot of space and it was clean bright and quiet! Sandra is very nice person. The communication with her was great! So everything worked perfectly! I would definitively stay there again! Thanks Sandra!
17366827,259726237,2018-05-02,58349156,Rinku,What makes a house a home are the people that reside in it! Being new to Canada not all of us get the privilege to be with our families but we make great friends along the way. Adel is one such friend I have now! He was very accommodative has a great sense of humour and an amazing taste in music. His house is minimalistic and clutter free but you'll get all the basic requirements. As per the location it's literally one minute away from the bus stop that takes you to the nearest subway in about 15mins. All in all it was a very pleasant experience and I would recommend anyone visiting Toronto to stay at Adel's adobe!
28345128,404894418,2019-01-25,17292937,Marwan,A great place very clean and very nice people will definitly be back
473827,215070443,2017-11-27,37759710,Anya,There is everything you might need in the apartment. The ambient is very pleasant and beautifully designed with a sense for details. Sitting by fireplace makes you forget that you are in a basement apartment.
14136531,228952853,2018-01-21,132714152,Ashley,Had a great stay at Kelly’s place in Toronto! Location was perfect for going out only a ten minute walk from King St. where you can find plenty of hip restaurants and bars. Everything was exactly as advertised and Kelly was a really accommodating host! The apartment was clean and spacious enough for me and my friends.
35467374,555321146,2019-10-27,178718629,Cynthia,"I really enjoyed staying here.  It was convenient to anything in Toronto and was in a stylish location. I felt like a local!

I loved having tea thanks to the electric kettle in the morning while looking at that city view!

I was travelling alone and always felt safe in the unit.

I would definitely stay here again it is a smaller unit so not suitable for a big family but solo travelers and couples this is a great stay in the heart of bustling Toronto!"

10266141,139469117,2017-03-25,96089459,Antonnette,Great accommodation true to the photos. Check-in was easy and Lauren was accessible and gave clear instructions. Very clean and pleasantly-decorated. I really recommend for people that enjoy art and are spiritual/earthy the overall environment is very soothing. Close to food and nightlife and the subway is only a few minutes walk away. Only drawback is hearing/feeling the vibrations from the subway underneath otherwise it's a great short-term stay!
18599447,359929232,2018-12-18,127832611,Sam,Brilliant value will not hesitate to use again!

16709255,487936955,2019-07-14,11666937,Brittany,Easy check-in clean and it was a great spot for a weekend stay for 6 people. The apartment is on one of the top floors so the view is nice but we had to wait in line for the elevator during high traffic times. Very walkable location. Cherry was responsive to questions and provided very detailed information for check-in instructions and parking locations.
29804344,543444654,2019-10-07,24860193,Lauren,You cannot beat this location. Tanya's apartment was nice cozy and perfect for two people. She was quick to respond and made sure we got in ok. The free parking was a much needed bonus even though we walked most places. Tanya also gave us some great recommendations.

Kate went above and beyond to help  me get to her place from the airport. It was my first time to Canada and she gave me info on what public transportation to take. I needed to check in early and Kate was very accommodating to let me check-in a few hours early. She even gave me info about places in the area where I could store my luggage in between checking out of her place and still being in the Downtown area. Kate was very responsive to every message I sent her. You will enjoy you stay at Kate’s Downtown condo.

Nice to have the 4 bedrooms but minimal common space (no area to sit and eat as dining table is tucked in the small nook by the kitchen) living room is nice. Building is definitely rough and could use some love but beds are comfy and it is reasonably priced.

516823,28898483,2015-03-31,21353638,Harold,"My girlfriend and I had an excellent experience at Paul's place.

Warm and cosy clean and comfortable upon arrival Paul was ready and even had some snacks and drinks in the fridge.

The place is pretty close to the center. You can either get the bus or walk to the subway - it sounds complicated to get to his place but it really isn't.

Grade A air bnb'ing. Highly recommend.

Thanks Paul for a great time at your place."

Natasha sempre respondeu todas as vezes que enviamos mensagem. Facilitou nosso check in de um quarto para o outro (estávamos hospedados em um quarto e ficamos uma outra noite neste quarto).
De modo geral o quarto atendeu nossas necessidades. Fica no subsolo mas é bom e confortável."

6843406,199354132,2017-10-01,151322730,Kyla,First time user of Airbnb and my experience was great.  The location of this home was perfect.  Within walking distance to so many great things.... groceries lcbo good beer and food.  The space was beautiful and clean.  The beds were comfortable!  The home had everything we needed for our stay. David was a gracious host.  Check in and out was a breeze.  Absolutely recommend this place!
19862260,355813226,2018-12-05,92038517,Bikramjeet,Host doesnot respond to guests on agreed upon deals even though they promise something such as cleaning and laundry they didnt provide those services - no cleaning services were provided. laundry was agreed as part of deal when i extended my trip but then they wouldnt respond for laundry when i would message them and make excuses that maintenance guy is out and cant open laundry door cleaning services were agreed upon during negotiation but later no cleaning was provided no kitchen trash bags were provided no kitchen soap and bathroom soap were provided on time! The host and the so-called maintenance guy try to  be nice during extensions and would tell you that all services provided to short term hosts will be provided to long term hosts as well but that is not the case. I found it very unpleasant that every time the host would move me to a different floor the host would flip the crockery plates (better quality) ones to the other floor - sort of weird and preferential behavior to other guests. This place is in parkdale and not liberty village its not value for your money in my opinion. Lost cost cheap no frills place!! Just decorated with some crystal balls and showcased as an exotic place to stay!

Sarah made a wonderful beet boursche and some delightful vegan brownies and was ever-excited to hear about my explorations in the city while I was there. I felt very at home in their home and I would highly recommend staying there if you get the chance. Hanging out with Chloe the pup isn't a bad deal either

You could tell that they deeply care about hospitality and making you feel welcome. Some hosts do this solely as a business but you can tell that hosting also brings them great joy. Fantastic hosts and a beautiful space very clean  well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. My only concern is that they charge too LITTLE for an experience this good!!! I really enjoyed my stay.
11759175,161783752,2017-06-18,76405551,Emily,The apartment was just as described.  Cozy and perfectly sufficient for my solo long weekend.  Would be snug but doable with 2 people.  Streetcar lines were just a couple blocks in either direction though I mostly opted for 30-45 minute walks to my destinations like Rogers Centre and CN Tower.  Quiet neighborhood but plenty nearby.  Good wifi no TV.
24995558,418182657,2019-03-01,77974212,Alison,The Airbnb was good very comfortable and had everything I needed. The bed was great everything was very clean and the kitchenette had what I needed to do a little bit of cooking. It was also very quiet considering it's such a huge building with so many units.
2863021,149332072,2017-05-03,30774844,Lee,"Bojan was an excellent host who accommodated my last minute request to stay in his space as well my continued flight delays and coordinating entrance to the apartment.

The apartment is perfect for a solo traveler couple or 2-3 friends. Very clean and everything you need. The location is perfect also for access to the rest of the city."
11787722,303496536,2018-08-07,23926638,Ana,Silvia is a very kind person and her place is very comfortable and looks similar to the photos with the exception that there were some objects and clothing occuping some space in our part of the house and we would have liked it better to have some more drawers to use. Besides that we had some problems with the doors she gave us the keys but it was quite difficult to get them to lock and unlock we found that the back door was easier but even though we had to spend a few minutes on it. Even so we recommend staying at her place its very nice and the location is great!

6766284,51397130,2015-10-19,29282624,Susanna,Jea was a lifesaver as she approved our booking on short notice (when our original Airbnb host cancelled our booking 3 days before flying into Toronto). She was incredibly kind and flexible with our arrival/departure. We were warmly greeted by Jea upon arrival at the condo. Her condo was beautiful! Amazing view of the CN Tower natural light throughout the ENTIRE condo very comfy bed full kitchen with contemporary styling. Plus it was within walking distance to a ton of restaurants cute coffee shops and cafes. Street car was at the corner so very easy to get around to explore other areas of Toronto. Jea stayed in contact with us throughout our stay for any questions and our check out was seamless. She was a huge factor as to why our trip turned out so great.  We would definitely stay at her place again. 
17777800,144123988,2017-04-14,28350235,Joseph,Condo was nice and clean. Great location. Shawn was very helpful.

15674452,242646793,2018-03-12,29514538,Elisa,If Airbnb had 6 stars to give to a host I would have to do so with Amanda's space. Amanda is very responsive and her place is amazing. The house is very organized and clean. The neighborhood is wonderful and we were able to park our car and easily walk and using public transportation with a double stroller. Amanda even left food in the fridge for breakfast. My family (2 toddlers and husband) and I enjoyed our stay in Toronto so much we hope to be beck very soon and stay at Amanda's again!

29483375,553643542,2019-10-24,15786539,Andrew,The location and price on this property were quite good but overall I can't recommend this property due to the number of issues with the property and the lack of detail to the basics needed for a good comfortable stay.
22402876,402774232,2019-01-19,3485693,Guille,Second stay everything according to my expectations.

23341705,498365147,2019-07-29,272294663,Kenneth,Although unit faces the highway noise is not an issue.  Would not stay more than 2 days since there are no dressers available for storing clothes.

They went above and beyond when we asked for suggestions regarding places to visit and things to do. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in Toronto!
19437788,241614652,2018-03-09,3162989,Marcelo,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6214925,164509046,2017-06-27,38914618,Mandy,The apartment was well equipped and comfortable. The vIew from the balcony at night is special. A nice place to stay!
34470215,554524449,2019-10-26,75794253,Tina,Location was really good. Space is clean .  Amenities are adequate but a few extra touches would have made it better.

8583887,420759277,2019-03-07,11279899,Grant,This is well located close to Union Station and convenient to the airport. The apartment is sparsely but nicely furnished giving a great sense of space. The bed was very comfortable and the room can be shut off further to ensure a quiet night sleep. The desk nook was very handy too for laptop use. My only suggestion would be to supply some basic amenities that the short term traveller is unlikely to bring with them (such as clothes washing detergent and other bathroom suppiles).
29012696,451294542,2019-05-11,256398817,Bren,"I stayed 8 nites in Gregory‘s place. 
My room with the city view is cozy and has a great comfy bed which let me catch some really good rest.
The place is clean with a modern & neat feel just as seen in the photos. 
The view from the flat as well as the condo location are simply unbeatable! There is a supermaket just across the road which is so convenient.
Gregory is very helpful positive and kind and responds to my queries always timely without fail.
A truly recommended place for a downtown stay."
21205308,231111016,2018-01-30,61313659,María José,The apartment is exactly as showed in the pictures. It was very clean and has everything you could need in an Airbnb. Very well placed in Toronto downtown. A lot of traffic on those streets but the apartment is extremely quite. Near the bus station metro and all the other transports.

23237628,273886297,2018-06-07,128289919,Likil,It's a good place to stay on vacations if you are the kind of people that cooks consider there is no kitchen however Michele tries to make your stay as comfortable as possible.
26669424,493539362,2019-07-22,198262090,Courtney,I wasn’t sure what to expect when I booked Jame’s place but it was very easy to feel at home during my stay. This space had everything me and my friends could have needed including a great location. I couldn’t have felt more comfortable and James was very nice in his messages and clearly wanted us to have a great stay :)

Everything was clean and comfortable and accommodates 4 people easily.
We drove up from Detroit and there is a municipal parking spot about a 4 minute walk from the Airbnb. You can recharge your parking with an app that Erin told me about. 
Would stay here again."
25264127,517465060,2019-08-25,279309049,Sameer,"I cannot say enough good things about George and his beautiful condo. He is very professional and his communication before and during our stay was top notch. I knew exactly what I needed to do and what to expect during our stay. The location is very nice as its close to many downtown attractions (CN Tower the Toronto aquarium the waterfront etc). The condo itself is very clean and had 2 bedrooms/2 bathrooms which was important as we were 5 people traveling. The apartment is well stocked with a lot of provisions although we didn't use them much since we had our own. The kitchen is well stocked. You also have access to underground parking. There is a Tim Hortons next to the building which was great.

We had a wonderful experience staying at this location and I would highly recommend George's condo to everyone."

His condo was equipped with all the necessities and then some. The space was exceptionally clean bright and immaculate. Dimitri was very responsive via text and checked in to make sure everything was going well. 

I felt more than comfortable and at home staying here. I was thoroughly impressed by the hospitality detail and effort put forth to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. I'd highly recommend Dimitri's place to anyone looking for a place like home away from home.  "
32787428,441028423,2019-04-21,4055506,Patricia,"Sean’s place was so lovely especially being newly furnished. It really felt like a home during our stay! However we did have to buy some things to use in the kitchen since it wasn’t fully stocked just yet.

Sean himself was easy to reach during our stay and help was always given in a very timely manner. Maintenance and cleaning was also very good.

It is located in convenient area since it is fairly close to other places. I would definitely recommend Sean’s place for future visitors.

Thanks again Sean!"
11625050,104620717,2016-09-27,95464001,Michael,This was our first time using airbnb and everything went perfectly especially as we had to book at short notice as our previous booking was cancelled a week before arrival (not through airbnb I might add). Tamara was a perfect host with great communication and advice. We didn't get to meet unfortunately as she was away however entry instructions were fine and her place was great equipped with everything we needed and with super comfy beds. The views were even better than on the website especially of the cn tower. Location was also perfect as it was just a short stroll down to the harbour front. All in all I couldn't fault anything and I will definitely be using airbnb again in the future.

The only complain would be is that the apartment was really warm. The fan would take a very long time to cool down the place. It didn't matter to me much as I enjoyed my stay with the windows open. But would definitely recommend!
21411007,262341721,2018-05-08,61464512,Mike,Nice spot we had a great stay convenient to the convention center.  Very responsive to questions very accommodating
21345752,312085033,2018-08-22,210195443,Fan,clean and comfortable 
20153310,179828827,2017-08-08,108615069,Rachel,Like a little apartment! Back porch area nice as well
32526278,494112088,2019-07-23,177170724,Terrence,This is an amazing space within walking distance of a ton of some of the more popular attractions in Toronto. The neighborhood is beautiful with tons of options for food  (either shopping or dining out). It's location made it super easy to call a Lyft (some places can't say the same) and the amenities are absolute class (the gym is better than some I have paid to use). You will be hard pressed to find a nicer place to stay in the city.
14340935,405138205,2019-01-26,219000202,Erik,Staying with Steve and his wife was wonderful! The view from their room was incredible especially at night. I am also a bit biased in saying their apartment was stylish because I love plants. We were only in town for 1 night but the location was wonderful and we will be returning!
27503620,501425279,2019-08-03,34982925,Francesco,Sekar è stato perfetto in tutto nelle spiegazioni nel check in nel preparare l'alloggio con precisione pulizia e gentilezza.
16108090,340353306,2018-10-23,158827949,David,Close to public transportation
20957479,227679313,2018-01-15,103694468,Cleo,5 stars in all aspects! To top off the amenities and service in their modern home Kenny is very open in sharing great recommendations for tourists and he provided daily water bottles and snacks by the door (I thought that was very thoughtful). Anyone would have a great stay in their home!
21527870,239882514,2018-03-03,163695418,Olivia,Great cozy place to stay when in Toronto

20316532,273555751,2018-06-06,189486291,Patrick,Very beautiful simple place (and very quiet). It's close to public transportation groceries store lcbo etc anything you would need to stay for a few days are just a few walks away. The host is always a text away. I would recommend this place for sure A++++
21065469,496553376,2019-07-27,77010839,Queenyc,It’s a nice house and has a lot of kitchen utensils but could be cleaned properly.
22361310,503841283,2019-08-06,261565722,Alan,Everything was great the neighborhood was extremely quiet and secure Charlotte was awesome because she responded fast and she let us leave our luggage at the AIRBNB before the check in that was a great help. Everything clean and cool the only thing that was not so cool was the bed that made a lot of noise hahh but apart of that everything was wonderful. I highly recommend it.
5082105,136130844,2017-03-08,61112005,Prab,The location was convenient to the entertainment district (CN Tower) and apartment was very cleanb with comfy beds. The house rules and nearby amenities are very well described.
24355508,282561283,2018-06-27,106867099,Marion,"Well what can I say I just came back. Super kind host. Rooms are clean and very cosy as the rest of the house. It just feels for me being at home. Breakfast is delicious especially the homemade bread. Great location. Public transportation is close. Quite neighbourhood but still close to the centre. 
I definitely will come back again:)
Take care Suzanne."
32406437,507548918,2019-08-11,225769395,Daniel,Great location affordable and lots of stores nearby. However it could have been much cleaner and the a/c and internet was pretty weak. Overall a good place to stay in the city for the solo traveler or a couple.
17559847,495205386,2019-07-25,114172682,Kathleen G,The photos doesn't give the place justice as it's much nicer and bigger in person. We felt like we're home with the amenities provided. Carlisle & Leroy were quick to respond with our concerns and were very accommodating with our requests.
16721025,262626796,2018-05-09,82520842,Annika,"Det var en jättetrevlig lägenhet och allting fungerade bra med boendet och Janet visade stor gästfrihet. Läget
är jättebra. Lugnt och tryggt
men nära till stadens utbud. Det är nära
till tunnelbanan och enkelt att resa."
4983319,50371006,2015-10-11,20389972,Nina,Nous avons passé un super week end chez Jim ! L'appartement était parfait : conforme à la description et propre ! L'appartement est très bien situé : proche de Queen street avec des boutiques et des restaurants très sympas ! Encore merci Jim !!
31212198,468886391,2019-06-13,128018204,Kyle,Centrally located to downtown for the price.
7216757,68682343,2016-04-06,7862613,Aban,we did not have the opportunity to meet Andrea but we met Judit she was really helpful and friendly. The apartment location is fantastic and the view is fascinating. The apartment was equipped well with everything that we needed.
16690972,167731309,2017-07-07,8201053,Amaury,"I had a great stay in this place. Sangeeta is a friendly person who helped me a lot with tips about the city. That's really a great place to stay in Toronto: clean quiet airy kitchen available to use. It is located in a great neighborhood near (about 1 block) from a Shopping Mall some pubs and restaurants and near Englinton subway station. So my friends this place for me is highly recommended.
"
13121978,431764514,2019-04-01,249090926,Fedja,Great hosts -- very responsive nice and helpful. Great location. Place was perfectly clean. Well equipped kitchen nice bathroom and comfortable bed. We very much enjoyed our stay!

12761297,311098682,2018-08-20,34658761,Marie-Claude,Logement agréable et propre  situé près d'une station de métro. Un seul reproche de ma part les doubles rideaux des chambres à coucher n'occultent pas la lumière et vous êtes réveillés très tôt si vous n'êtes pas habitués à dormir dans ces conditions.
21650230,260634134,2018-05-04,186471253,Brian,Jenny was an amazing host. The home was immaculate the beds were very comfortable and the condo is in a perfect location with everything you could need in walking distance. Can’t wait to come back!
29826702,455467764,2019-05-19,183203150,Tiffany,Great stay thanks
21612862,335945597,2018-10-13,203325306,Colin,Kelvin's place offered a centrally located penthouse apartment at a reasonable price. The space is shared but they gave me plenty of privacy and were welcoming hosts. It was great to have access to a kitchen and laundry. I'd stay there again.
18006359,217988338,2017-12-10,143858737,Justin-Charles,
35043996,521258854,2019-08-31,71284894,Kevin,Enjoyed my stay at Van’s place. Very clean and the pictures show an accurate representation. Had everything I needed!
7324823,151052318,2017-05-10,13359840,Tyler,Shannon and Axel were great to work with.
7132329,191460961,2017-09-07,63821015,Ashley,Clean & lovely apartment! Good communication with the host throughout the process- once booked around check-in and throughout my stay. I had a wonderful stay and would love to be back again in the future!
22958941,304955257,2018-08-10,99230070,Roland,Me and my brother really enjoyed our stay. The communication was on point the room and house were very clean and everything was on a walking distance. All in all I would definitely recommend staying here. 
534962,65149114,2016-03-11,42387353,Mariana,"Gostei muito da localizacao praticamente todos os dias andei apé quarto confortavel TV e Frigobar no quarto muito bons. 
Pontos negativos.
Apesar da residência ser próximo dos principais pontos turísticos ha muitos mendigos na rua a noite fazem muito barulho. Os hóspedes da casa também fazem muito barulho a noite.
Fiquei no quarto 1  por isso não pude abrir a janela nenhum dia a vista é para varanda aonde todos tem acesso e fumam o dia inteiro.
Banheiro é fora do quarto mas não considero isso tao ruim um ponto importante é que precisei comprar papel higiênico eles não fornecem.
A casa não é tao limpa tem uma pessoa que ajuda na limpeza mas a quantidade de hospedes nao permite que ela fique limpa."
12454490,97378612,2016-08-27,45404088,Fei,It's so nice! 
25486124,292299792,2018-07-17,51477578,Qing,房子不大但够用也比较干净位置非常优越就在博物馆边上｡逛街吃饭地铁都十分方便｡而且sasha很nice我需要两个床垫及两套床单和被子她都准备好了｡洗衣机也非常好用方便了我们长途旅行的人｡厨具一应俱全虽然我们并没有用到很多｡我们在这里住了四天一切都很好｡
573892,51665330,2015-10-22,11362932,John And Marilyn,Frank was very accommodating at the arrival process. The location of his airbnb is centrally located and very convenient to lots of amenities. I would gladly recommend Frank's accommodation to others.
31384624,481871824,2019-07-05,125460960,Earlnie,Great location just like the pictures great hospitality from the host. There was an issue on the first day but Lyla went above and beyond to address the issue.
15190948,225821917,2018-01-07,45607256,Viviane,Bel appartement bien situé un parking à disposition ce qui est inestimable à Toronto. Le système de clé électronique n’est pas très pratique car il faut d’abord aller récupérer un passe pour activer l’ascenseur et accéder au 11eme étage. Attention si comme nous vous arrivez de bonne heure à Toronto pas de possibilité de déposer vos bagages quelque part avant 15h. Il manquait un peu de vaisselle pour cuisiner mais en dehors de cela l’appartement était très propre et très joliment décoré.
17407876,329323963,2018-09-28,6661662,Deborah,Lovely place to stay!
20902086,218914561,2017-12-15,53762280,Jessica,This unit was great exactly like the pictures. Very cute well furnished and clean. Host was great with communication and answered all inquiries right away. Great location right downtown Toronto. Would recommend!
23150861,237854901,2018-02-24,58216217,Ally,Great place! Easy to contact and communicate with. Place had everything we needed and was clean. Looks nicer in person than in photos.
6198704,276371452,2018-06-13,15303816,Alan,"Location was great. A coffee shop right at the corner for breakfast. The place is quiet as I expected and the view is amazing.

Thank you Adam."
3269244,345120201,2018-11-04,14710854,Olivia,Lisa is a great host she was very responsive and accommodating. The place itself was great and very comfortable.
24921286,522146613,2019-09-01,283542038,상혁,"It was very comfortable staying at this place the room was very clean. Host was very kind which made the stay much more comfortable. 
Good location only few minutes to the subway station good area with great people."
1762021,417833546,2019-02-28,22417,Michael,Great location responsive host very cozy and comfortable!  There happened to be a snow storm while we were in town and I can hardly think of a cozier place to be stuck for a few days!
24911265,293082762,2018-07-19,10899867,Markus,This place is a 5 star most definitely ! Love the ciew & everything about it. Great hosts !
28888613,562270293,2019-11-10,4469778,Erika,The apartment was very clean and easy to access. The beds were comfortable. We had a short delay with check-in due to the previous guest but the host was very in touch and made it easy. Overall would highly recommend!
19711890,456404551,2019-05-21,182839237,Michael,Awesome place. Great kitchen
33494191,489319755,2019-07-16,265542046,Pavla,Nice house with lot of great pets. Claire is very kind and helpful.
28624772,434857314,2019-04-08,172530744,Pascal,I may have been unlucky because a bathroom was not clean but the rest of the apartment was. Is there a room forgotten by cleaning? Who knows? Remember that this is an apartment in the basement of a house so you can hear walking and talking. Otherwise it is a good apartment at a good price for this region.
21849711,263670883,2018-05-12,153312105,Jingmei,Lindsay is really friendly!!! This apartment has a pretty good view of the city.
7114009,346993478,2018-11-10,216045067,Nina,My stay at Kathleen's was nothing short of perfect! Kathleen is a wonderful giving and positive person and this shows in all the details of the accommodation. The place is sweet and peaceful. It is also close to the beach and the charming shops and cafes on Queen-street. Highly recommended to anyone! P.S. The cutest dog in the world Millie will also steal your heart <3
34087578,457228040,2019-05-23,124158288,Wayne,Very calming and beautiful spot. I felt relaxed and sleepy really well for a change. The shower is well worth the stay!
6542106,106490077,2016-10-06,44742527,Sunny,Din is a wonderful and excellent host and the flat is a nice basement with beautiful sight to the green grassy backyard.  I would certainly recommend it to everybody!
9576150,327183711,2018-09-23,191562913,Kim,Beverly's place is in Greek town close (less than 10 minute walk) to 2 subway stations. It takes about 20-25 minutes to get to the Distillery District by subway. Beverly is from Toronto and is involved with the community so she has great tips about the city if you ever need some.
27363175,564687823,2019-11-16,157375992,Nontawat,Spacious clean and very convenient to find food. The place is exactly as the photos suggested. I would love to stay to this place again when I have the next chance to visit Toronto. The host is very friendly. Thanks for everything!
16548240,449376152,2019-05-06,252837422,Thomas,A wonderful place to stay in the heart of the city!
10287803,239650709,2018-03-02,43588100,Christian,I had a great visit!  Wayne is quite a host.  Very organised with any questions you may have already answered before you ask them.
13432995,82172119,2016-06-26,74176996,Doug,Fantastic experience. Clean safe welcoming and a great location near everything you need in downtown Toronto. Wonderful amenities in the building.
29687084,527784408,2019-09-11,225746451,Megan,Great location!
15239234,142850686,2017-04-09,97372378,Bijun,It was such a fantastic stay. Everything of this studio is great. Walking distance to everywhere. Owner is nice friendly and helpful. Every time we have questions she answered pretty much right away. Awesome experience. I will definitely stay here again when I come to Toronto next time.
19153053,165333582,2017-06-30,9440163,Jessica,The position was good you can walk to bus station and it gets you to downtown Toronto in 10mins if you don't want to waste your time on waiting bus it take you about 15 mins to it. The room was perfectly clean the bathroom is just a step out also you find it as clean as hotel. The check-in and out process was flexible  the host is considerate she is always ready for our questions! Taco the cat is extremely adorable we had much fun with this taco baby!
15903030,212015776,2017-11-15,85864308,Mike,"The only two things that this has going for this unit is location and cleanliness.   It needs a lot of work to make it more homey and comfortable it is noisy the ceiling is an office ceiling. Also the one bedroom has poor privacy as my guest had people looking down into the bedroom from the roof through the skylight.   Yes the price is good for the location but this was not a comfortable stay.   
Check in was very easy and went as planned."
3663617,323407019,2018-09-15,206639891,Mélissa,Super !!
12924888,231484052,2018-02-01,80575326,Augusto,The space was really great and despite being far from downtown it's really easy to get around. The house is clean big equiped with a very nice complete kitchen and it's cleaned very often by a professional company. The bedroom and furniture were very nice as well with an accessible price and very easy going stay. Communication with the hosts went very easy and quick-to-answer as well.
17917883,303500801,2018-08-07,102004827,Charlotte,What a stunning condo.  The location was a block away from the CN tower with a beautiful view from the balcony.  Every window of this place had a stunning view!  The place is impeccably decorated and gave you the swanky downtown feel.  This place is well worth the price.  The convenience of being in the heart of the city the 32nd floor location and modern/comfortable feel - we can't wait to come back rent this space again! 
20941977,267756620,2018-05-22,83607499,Anie,Lydia is a great host very polite accommodating and prompt with her communications. The place was very clean and well furnished. The location was great as well - in the heart of Toronto downtown close to all major attractions and steps away from College station. Will definitely recommend to travellers visiting Toronto!
20868592,327165408,2018-09-23,19573361,Michelle,Good area close to many amenities / Yorkdale mall. Easy check in. Great host.
32698291,513546979,2019-08-19,83606641,Wanda,Great condo and location
31615125,565624240,2019-11-17,84356410,Mandy,Sam was a great host. And the room had amazing views of the CN tower and city the location was perfect across the road from the rink and union station and the building had grocery store bars and restaurants in the lower lever. Will be back
1016125,483593779,2019-07-07,32450062,Andrew,I highly recommend Jaclyn’s place! She keeps her apartment extremely clean and had lots of thoughtful touches. We appreciated the coffee and extra toiletries! We arrived a little after midnight but received a very warm welcome. Also the location was great.
29954312,551842235,2019-10-20,197321559,Travis,Alex was a great host. He provided crystal clear check in instructions on the morning of arrival. Can’t beat the location and the space is perfect for large groups. Thanks again Alex for your hospitality!
1080121,198478315,2017-09-29,9413816,Irene,This was a fabulous apartment on harbour front and within a walk of all you would want to see. The bed was super comfortable and we were sad to leave. Katy was a great host with very prompt response to any queries she even organised the return of our IPad that we had left behind. Thank you Katy and James
19891685,245741802,2018-03-23,3762094,Simone,Great apartment great location great hosts.
14996191,205489586,2017-10-22,18907091,Queen,The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
31087956,503145749,2019-08-05,241324622,Ali,Kenny is an amazing host!! He replied to my messages very quickly and also helped me out whenever I needed it. Super clean place and check in was extremely easy. Definitely recommend him!!
8272028,57841998,2015-12-29,47980904,Christopher,Ulana was a fantastic host. Everything was as described and she made us feel comfortable and gave us privacy as well as good company when we wanted. Also the cats were fun to play with as well! Highly recommend.
19942412,438786425,2019-04-17,249986921,Robyn,David is a great host! He made our stay in Toronto wonderful.  We had a long drive in but were fortunate enough for the check in process to be easy and a bonus was the convenient parking! He provides a map as to where the permit parking is allowed.  He was very accommodating and provided a pack n play for our little one (which definitely saved us space in our car).  The location is close to everything. We walked to local shops and restaurants. The place is very clean and comfortable. There’s also a washer and dryer which was very convenient as well. I highly recommend this location. Thank you David!!
22056356,228028489,2018-01-17,166442629,Hannah,My friend and I were headed to Danforth Music Hall to see two shows in a row and needed a place to stay in between. This was the perfect place for us because it was walking distance and offered just what we needed. The bed was comfortable and the place was clean. There is a kitchen space too but we ended up not needing it. Great spot for the price!
4816575,178464859,2017-08-05,134515399,Quentin,"Highly recommended!

Sam is a great host who gives you a lot of privacy while at the same time being available for discussions on a wide array of subjects. His two cats too are the friendliest cats I've ever met.

The house is located in a quite area just minutes away from Queen Street West which leads you directly to downtown Toronto. Ideal to enjoy everything the city has to offer.

All in all a great experience."
19317617,299332268,2018-07-30,154261412,Ash,Yaning was an excellent host and was very responsive and helpful. If you are looking for a breathtaking view this is definitely the place for you !! Thanks for a great first visit to Toronto!
3873403,521137285,2019-08-31,195621890,Rachel,We absolutely loved this place. It was super cozy and we immediately felt at home. Everything was just as described. The bed felt and looked super clean. Many amenities are included tending to everyone’s needs. Such as a fan a space heater extra blankets and pillows etc. These hosts really pay attention to detail and are very accommodating. They definitely surpassed our expectations especially after accepting our request to book within 20 mins when we were to be arriving 4 hours later. Would definitely stay here many more times if ever we were to visit Toronto again.
14201737,140953201,2017-04-01,97763141,Bruno,Amelia's place is awesome! Just like in the pictures it is located in a walk distance to most of the main streets of downtown  can't go wrong with it. Her place is clean and comfortable and Amelia is very welcoming friendly and available for helping case we need. Thanks again Amelia for the great times we had in your place and in your company! :)  
28976423,346989234,2018-11-10,221955253,Kasandra,everything was very clean! We arrived very late because we were leaving from afar and there was no problem with the hosts! have really enjoyed it and we are going back to this airbnb if have returned to Toronto!

21264975,214089375,2017-11-24,156539656,Andrew,A lovely home in a quiet neighborhood very close to the Christie subway station.  Burkhard was very chill and extremely welcoming.  This was our very first Air BnB experience and he made it amazing!  I would have a very hard time staying anywhere else the next time we go to Toronto.  We had a very private room and a separate bathroom.  The shared spaces upstairs were very comfortable as well although we were out in the city most of the time.  Highly recommended!

29734415,435466378,2019-04-10,5092830,Lobat,The house is well located and very easy to get around from there with low-cost Uber rides or the train . It is in an area with shops and restaurants a local park and an easy walk to the local train/subway in TO.  We were able to get right in the heart of downtown for a conference as well as take the train to Niagara Falls. The area is residential but not suburban in feel. You won't regret staying here as you will have the feeling of having your own home while in TO but with all the convenience of being near all the events and cool stuff happening in TO.
21900543,357990914,2018-12-12,21766415,Kim,The location was perfect and the condo was very nice. I am a frequent user of Airbnb and I would stay here again. Thanks Sammy!

The pictures are pretty accurate and the house is very kid-friendly.  The outdoor patio was an added bonus as was the backyard and driveway parking. Washer/Dryer in the garage made it very convenient for us traveling with kids!    
4128146,174337993,2017-07-25,4040929,Kristin,"Janet was by far the nicest and most helpful person we have met through Airbnb during our two months in Canada. She always answered every question within a second gave us a lot of tips and even brought us in contact with our neighbours to help us with professional issues. Just a wonderful person who cares A LOT about the people who stay in her house.
The house is nice. For us it was perfect to not be directly in Downtown as we have two little kids. So we could enjoy the beach close by. (10 minutes Jogging Distance). Enjoy your stay!"

13256555,131108889,2017-02-10,20017212,Danbee Angela,We had a wonderful stay at Yas' place. Her place was neat and cozy with a lovely company of a cat named Shadow. The bathroom was in between our room and Yas's yet we had no issue sharing. The bathroom was always super clean and simple. Our room was very warm and the queen sized bed was just perfect. Yas made sure our stay was comfortable. She was always ready to give us suggestions on where the good restaurants were. Overall we enjoyed chatting with her. Yas is super cool and we appreciated everything while we stayed at her place especially her traditional cookie! She made sure our check-in and check-out were easy and convenient. Without a doubt she is a super host! We would definitely stay at her place again when we need a place in downtown. (Thanks!)

29700943,528218951,2019-09-12,197186257,Bryan,Brahm’s place is perfect for a short stay in downtown. There were no issues parking the car in the alleyway  lot by the gas station (although it was a bit difficult to locate at first). As far as checking in it was was explained very well in Brahm’s directions. The space itself was good for my short stay but the price definitely reflects what is provided. Don’t expect anything more than the minimum which is a roof over your head and a few amenities. If this does not bother you I highly recommend Brahm’s place as the price is right and the location is perfect for downtown exploring.
14407173,321119385,2018-09-09,200934000,Gillian,Kevin's place was great! Very clean with a good location close to the subway. Kevin was very easy to communicate with and responded very quickly to all messages. The building also has a pool which is a nice addition. Overall a great time in Toronto!

834150,19301701,2014-09-09,1105800,Shelley,Lauren was a wonderful host. Communicative and warm and welcoming. Her home had this great funky vibe was easily accessible to public transportation in a totally safe neighbourhood - but the best part of my stay was meeting Lauren and having coffee and excellent conversation in her kitchen:-). Will absolutely be staying here again. Thanks for making my stay so awesome!
23310396,331039769,2018-10-01,79184907,Eddie,Fantastic apartment in a perfect location within Toronto. Views of the water and CN tower from the balcony a real treat! Carl is a great host and easy to communicate with I would definitely stay here again.

It was true value for money pre-arrival instructions were superb the apartment was very clean and matched the online description as described.  The neighbourhood is quiet and within walking distance to all listed amenities.

4117546,332554163,2018-10-05,5788103,Noelle,Khalid’s place was the perfect location for us to enjoy great restaurants in Toronto and close to the theatre district. The condo is spacious and the beds were comfortable. There is plenty of space to make meals in the well laid out kitchen with some amenities provided. The condo could use a bit of TLC but was just right for our Toronto get away.
11450803,99931180,2016-09-06,37707966,Ricky,Ara's condo was good. It had all the essentials and was close by the 401. The area is relatively quiet & great for walks.

He also offered wondeful tips of the where to eat shop and be entertained in the neighborhood!  The apartment is beautiful  clean and stylish. It had everything I needed for cooking laundry plus access to Netflix and fast internet! The AC worked very well and the private terrace is a heavenly space covered in grape vines - with gorgeous views of the sunset. It’s a charming neighbourhood with a variety of wonderful restaurants and great vintage shops.

10485802,81664950,2016-06-24,22955948,Ryan,Fantastic place. Almost don't want to write a public review on it because it is such a well done space - especially for the price point - and I want to keep it like a secret. Will definitely stay here again on my next trip to TO.

382423,161851823,2017-06-18,134723326,Jonathon,This is a spotlessly clean and tidy unit on the edge of Kensington I look forward to staying there again. However be aware  it is a very simple basement unit this may or may not be what you are after.

13476773,141271958,2017-04-02,15145869,Natalie,We loved our stay in Toronto! We came from Chicago for a three day weekend. The location of the studio was perfect. We were about a 10 minute drive from the downtown area as well as Harbourside. The studio was very clean and perfect for two tourists! It is stocked with amenities which was very convenient. Street Parking was a little bit of an issue but we managed to find some. The street the studio is located on as a plethora of coffee shops places to eat and a  convenient store. I definitely recommend Krumes place & can't wait to go back and visit. Thank you!
30773748,559132878,2019-11-03,233707473,Erin,We came to Toronto with our extended family and the house suited our needs perfectly. It was clean comfortably furnished and in a great location. We would definitely return again.
21485418,321543599,2018-09-10,87521999,Quiniva,the place was great even though it is actually a little outside of toronto
23905850,483556541,2019-07-07,255614399,Yash,We spent 4 days at this house. Great place to live. Well maintained very clean. You will find everything you need in the house. Great host.
3860782,79516462,2016-06-13,71646029,Keith,Cindy was welcoming and also was easy to get in touch with if we had questions.  I love the Annex and it was so convenient to the subway or to catch a cab on Bathurst or Dupont.  The kitchen was pretty functional and the beds were comfortable.  It is a funky space. However comfortable and close to the action in Toronto is what makes this house great.
36236739,510079548,2019-08-15,43626816,Beatriz,Great and modern space near main bus line and many restaurants. Super comfortable bed. Longyu responded promptly all our queries.
2151532,99998740,2016-09-06,86519489,Jakub,Místo má skvělou polohu a pokud člověk jen trochu chhceprakticky celé Toronto je v docházkové vzdálenosti. Apartmán byl dobře vybaven včetně nádobí v kuchynijen chybělo trochu denního světlaale nic co by se pár dní nedalo vydržet.
15132324,191755966,2017-09-08,21692381,Ana Júlia,They were incredible. They picked me up in the airport at 2 am gave me all instructions that I needed fallow me until the bus stop... they are always available to help. The best airbnb host. I recommend them for everyone.
4721087,51665155,2015-10-22,32029699,Bill,Nice guy easy check-in/check-out. Place was nice new and in a convenient location. Good value for the money too. Would recommend the property and host. 
38489592,560353722,2019-11-06,70303524,Maria Gabriela,The apartment has a great location close to the subway and in walking distance from downtown. However when we got to the apartment it had clearly not been cleaned. The floor and bathroom sink were dirty the dishes had not been done and the trash can had not been emptied. We also found a little mouse running around which we had to take out by ourselves. We contacted the host who was very reactive and surprised to hear about this. She told us another cleaner would come the next day to deal with all of this. However no one came and the host refunded the cleaning fee. From the other commentaries and the host’s responses I don’t believe this is something that happens often but we found it important to mention anyway.
33809277,464838290,2019-06-06,49948711,George,Great stay central clean comfortable
5666775,225185810,2018-01-05,107836823,Withya,Tammy was great! Instructions were clear and easy to understand. No confusion whatsoever. Such a nice clean location! Thanks Tammy!

21081966,302323540,2018-08-05,194393286,Hayley,I absolutely loved staying here. It is in a great location close to shops restaurants and bars. Jerome is a wonderful host who keeps in regular contact to ensure the stay is going well. Check in is extremely easy and the bed is one of the comfiest I’ve ever slept in! The kitchen is equipped with everything you would need as well.

24450728,315339878,2018-08-28,17566654,Malcolm,This is an elegant property in a shaded avenue set in a stylish neighbourhood. It offers three decent sized double bedroom spaces. In a letting market that offers basements this delivers high ceilings and space. Our host was available for trouble shooting and advice which is best practice to my way of thinking . It was worth the outlay for us and I hope they succeed.
26166745,329324504,2018-09-28,192993925,Aysha,JB was a fantastic host. I felt welcome the second I arrived at his place. He's a lot of fun! And his dogs are awesome! perfect location as well. 30 minutes walk to Dundas square. I felt right at home at JBs place and I'd recommend it to anyone. :)

23933487,264715880,2018-05-14,34450909,Juan Pablo,Aj was really kind and welcoming. He gave us recommendations regarding things to do restaurants and shops. The house was clean and in a really  good location. It is quite close to the downtown. You can walk there. Public transport (tram) which leads you to the old center is also close by. I definitely recommend Aj as a host.

19555561,347672622,2018-11-11,35519592,David,I had a very comfortable stay at Tony’s. Tony was very quick at replying and was accommodating with the check-in and check-out times. The unit was sparkling clean and had more than enough amenities that I needed during my trip. I would highly recommend this place!

38356743,545113620,2019-10-11,4307016,Tal,"Owner constantly give me a bunch of excuses to get into apartment to check if everything is OK. 
I had to contact Airbnb several times to stop him from entering without permission. Not happy at all."
22308870,262395673,2018-05-08,70308940,Romain,Appartement bien situé disposant d'une place de parking bien pratique. Le check-in/check-out se fait de manière extrêmement aisée. Le seul petit bémol viendrait peut-être du chauffage un peu bruyant mais rien de bien méchant !
27466879,363308726,2018-12-28,43264656,Matthew,The place was clean and in a great location. Checking in was easy.

19389400,168025452,2017-07-08,136294486,Jay,"Was in town to attend a couple of Blue Jays games. Location was perfect for this as the stadium is a 3 minute walk away. The view from the 53rd floor is gorgeous. 

My only suggestion would be to install some curtains or blinds. The place fills with light as soon as the sun rises and there's no way to escape it. Also there's no remote for the tv or any kind of tv service. "
16203672,305596532,2018-08-11,997754,Thuy,Nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Shimon et Schule. Ils sont très accueillants.
8838621,479865151,2019-07-01,128338152,Vasso,The condo was very clean and fully equipped! Easy check in and check out. The wifi was perfect and the welcoming / guiding by the host was really helpful.

20620905,569091971,2019-11-25,147809916,Birgit,Our family of 6 came from California to visit family and see Toronto. The home fit out needs. Brent is a gracious host and was there to greet us and answer any questions. We all enjoyed our stay. We would definitely recommend Brent and Lori’s place! 
16613912,223672170,2018-01-01,20176391,Morgan,Probably one of the best appointed AirBNBs I've stayed at globally. Cute neighborhood with plenty grocery/restaurant options within walking distance or on UberEats; cozy home with all the amenities to enjoy a meal at home Netflix binge in front of the fire or get a restful night's sleep in a king size bed. Great hostess who was quick to respond and offer any local recommendations or additional amenities as needed. HIGHLY recommend for a laid back stay in Toronto where you want to live like a local but be close enough to the action - if you decide that you really want to step outside this adorable home that is!
682099,44270650,2015-08-24,41230885,Zeljko,"Basically friendly host and fast reply to my request. 
-> However when being asked to confirm ASAP I first didn't feel suspicious but then later found in the confirmation Email that the room rate of 65€ skyrocketed to 112€ (additional cleaning fees etc.. The host explained that airbnb was offering the option to increase the price and then did so. I found that to be a very bad deal for a tiny room and no WIFI reception except for the other rooms. So that was a bit disappointing. I recommend to check the price in the confirmation email before final confirmation to not end up paying almost double price ;("
25269135,458100604,2019-05-25,71030625,Tom,"Very convenient location for me. Nice place and very quick responses. I'd stay here again. Just a few items to note:

- At 6ft tall the ceilings are low so watch your head. 
- Going downstairs is a bit narrow. Having heavy bags while trying to manuever wasn't the most pleasant. 
- Please note where the parking places are as the no parking signs aren't very well posted. 

Still a lovely place and wouldn't mind staying again."

It's located in a nice quiet area within minutes from Queen's West where you can find alot of restaurants bars and coffee shops.

I'd definitely recommend!"
6283763,362510792,2018-12-26,34059439,Marco,"Mejor departamento de los que habíamos arrendado. Muy buen estilo y había todo que uno podría necesitar. Amplio Mike y Jen muy amables y preocupados calentito y excelente ubicación. Si bien una de las calles vecinas no parecía tan segura el resto del barrio es precioso con casas victorianas hermosas parques tiendas y a unos minutos de todo. La ubicación es la clave 5 minutos caminando al mall principal 15 a Lawrence market 20 a destilary district etc. Los parques que encontramos son muy lindos. Y en la casa me sentí muy cómoda y es que es muy lindo el departamento!!! 
Lo recomiendo 100%!!!yo volvería."

17319601,321046400,2018-09-09,48633404,Dianne,Brenda's place is a cosy apartment in a great location for public transport restaurants and grocery shopping. It also has its own parking to the side of the building. The stairs to the apartment are quite steep and extreme care is needed when getting suitcases up and down. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom was larger than I expected for a small apartment. There is a bit of street noise and street lighting keeps the apartment light in the evenings. The bed and pillows are very soft. Overall a great apartment for a stay in Toronto. Easy to get about with the tram stop at the front of the building.

The house in general was very clean and comfortable to make it such a nice stay in Toronto. I definetly recommend it to everyone!
13731811,144752004,2017-04-16,39009494,Alison,Benedict's place is in one of the nicest neighborhoods in Toronto. He was incredibly flexible about check-in and check-out times. The place itself was great for one person such as myself. Lake Ontario just down the street and the lock on the door made life very easy. Overall a very easy relaxing stay.
38458992,530190592,2019-09-15,140508177,Pat,Great host. Completely private in full 1 bedroom apt. Has 2 queen sized beds 1 in the room and 1 in the living room and plenty of chairs. Tons of space to bring an extra air mattress and it also has a large balcony. 10/10

4687194,104442691,2016-09-26,1259578,Lily,Don is an excellent host.  His duplex 3 bedroom apt was very clean and spacious and had everything we (6 adults) needed and more. Apt looks exactly like pictures posted online.  Don had 6 sets of bath hand & face towels folded nicely on each bed.  There were more than enough cups plates & utensils for us to use.  Washer and dryer with detergent if needed in apt iron hair dryer shampoo and body wash in both bathrooms.  Don was very accommodating and responsive.  We arrived early & Don allowed us to check in earlier than set time.  Location was very safe easy to get to and had everything you need from supermarkets to restaurants to coffee shops and drug stores.  Parking spot provided in driveway and plenty of parking spots on street without permit required if need additional parking. I would definitely recommend Don's place to anyone staying in Toronto.  
18889880,444958690,2019-04-28,199298240,Kathryn,The condo is great! Has everything you need and is in an amazing location. We enjoyed checking out the nearby restaurants and bars walked to a Blue Jays game and had easy access to the subway for exploring other areas of Toronto. The affordable onsite parking was a huge bonus. Hope to return again soon.

14612719,315332610,2018-08-28,140260100,Andy,As described convenient location and easy to get to Davisville station. Thanks for a great experience for a first timer in Canada! 
20033735,303071903,2018-08-06,74388853,M.L.,"Sheena was a great host and very polite. She responded to my questions very quick through texting and gave me good information about the area and recommended a couple of restaurants. Her place is very close to downtown and it’s only a 15-20 minute walk. Sheena’s apartment was very small and the pictures in the listing seem as if it was a decent size place. The place was really hot so we had to buy fans because it didn’t have AC inside. 
In my opinion it’s a nice place in a nice area but I think the place is only good for one person."
18521777,354099711,2018-11-30,357364,Sara,Easy check in well situated simple and clean place.

21755182,346401771,2018-11-08,110333705,Patricia,"Suzanna and Matt;  My friend and I totally enjoyed our stay at your condo in Toronto.  The location was perfect for our convention.  It was about a 2 minute walk from your condo.  I want to applaud you for the comfort and style of the condo.  It truly is located in a perfect spot for so many things.  I highly recommend the play ""Come from Away"" at the Mervish Royal Alexander Theatre. It's only a 2.5 block walk from your place.  Truly thanks again for your attention to detail.  It was great and I highly recommend staying at your condo."

18917273,314403660,2018-08-26,50397410,Dan,This is the second time I've stayed at James' listing.  What he offers is what you get; there are no surprises.  What I like most is that James is quick to respond to communication from me and also that his listing is as affordable as it is yet also as close to downtown Toronto as I felt comfortable being.  I'll definitely stay at James' listing again!

8546395,141259073,2017-04-02,75936767,Laure-Elise,Charmante chambre bien équipée (à la limite du trop!) dans une propriété de la banlieue torontoise. Compter au moins 45 minutes pour vous rendre au centre-ville mais l'arrêt de bus est au coin de la rue et passe aux 10 minutes. Il y a des supermarchés et autres commerces proches mais surtout de nombreux parcs qui surplombent le lac Ontario. Les propriétaires sont très sympathiques de même que leur chat.
834150,13169062,2014-05-20,1920236,Julien,Lauren was unfortunately not there during our stay but the apartment was ready for us. Everything was done to make us feel good. The apartment is very well placed for visiting Toronto. I highly recommend Lauren and her flat!

12761297,206270837,2017-10-24,1343772,Claire,This is a bright and charming little apartment with lots of really nice touches and very clean. It's close to the subway in the west of the city and handy for the UP Express Bloor Station stop from the airport. Creaking from the apartment overhead did wake me up a couple of times as a light sleeper but otherwise it was really very quiet and I would be happy to stay here again. Decent kitchen for self-catering too and good shower.
10350830,500755168,2019-08-02,237615008,Albert,La ubicació és perfecte. En un barri amb molta oferta gastronòmica. Allotjament amb total intimitat. Repetiria sense cap mena de dubte.

Excellent apartment with a very nice kitchen set up beautiful granite countertops and kitchen backdrop. Smart TV was very useful on days that I wasnt at school and didnt want to step out. Amenties were nicer than the listing showed and I was pleasantly surprised when i arrived. The Host (Rebeca) was lovely and made sure I felt comfortable and supported throughout my stay any requests or additional things I needed she was happy to bring to me she even suggested some great cafes nearby to try during my stay. I got excellent hospitality location and overall experience I would suggest you strongly consider this location for your next Toronto vacation.  Thanks again Rebecca for making sure I had a great stay.

Very clean and very comfortable bed

 if it is small as mentioned in the publication
If you are a tall person I would recommend you look for another option
Perfect to stay several days
But that if something removed from downtown Toronto
But public transport can take you without problems"

11667594,164784278,2017-06-29,57452008,Barbara,Very modern apartment with a spectacular view of downtown Toronto. You could not ask for a better location.  Secured parking is available at an extra fee—be sure to specify if you need it.  (It is a huge bonus).  Vahan was very helpful and concerned that everything worked out well for us; I would definitely stay here again.
20401239,303572172,2018-08-07,14827061,Lara,Eric was a wonderful host! His responses were quick and he was able to accommodate us at the last minute.

8756013,196254910,2017-09-22,104274931,Chun,Yada's place was lovely. Very spacious and clean. Perfect for couples or groups of up to 6. The kitchen was beautiful and the AC was a plus for the summer nights. Would stay again when in the area.

10350830,328592177,2018-09-26,30137960,Andree,Die Unterkunft bei Chris war im großen und ganzen ganz OK. Kein Luxusaber das haben wir auch nicht erwartet. Besonders gut war die Lage. 3 Minuten bis zur Haltestelle für die Straßenbahn. In maximal 15 min ist man im Zentrum. Es gab eigentlich nichts zu bemängeln. Geparkt werden muss auf der Rückseite des Hauseswo es alles etwas eng istaber auch das geht. Man kann die Unterkunft auf jeden Fall empfehlen. Leider kein TV aber stand auch nicht in der Beschreibung. WLAN hat gut funktioniert.
10791293,154673795,2017-05-25,60108990,Rodrigo,I have said it before and I say it again: Angela's place is fantastic and she is a great human being. I cannot imagine going to Toronto and staying anywhere else.
15362533,143801175,2017-04-13,5787536,Cathy,"I've stayed in a couple other places in Toronto but from now on I would stay here when I visit. What I liked:
-excellent midtown location. Close to the street car line and walkable to the subway. 5 minute walk from restaurants and cafes. Quiet pretty residential street.
-clean and comfortable. Kevin provides all the basics necessary for a good home base: coffee tea a comfy bed and wifi!
-really efficient check-in/check-out. I had only one question about the whole process and Kevin responded within minutes.
-parking. This is always part of the trouble for me. I drive to Toronto and parking prices and options are always difficult. The apartment included a parking spot that happily held my car while I made my way around Toronto by foot and transit. 

If you stay here go eat a scone at Baker & Scone on St. Clair :)"
17187955,542570762,2019-10-06,3614678,Valerie,Very comfy place for 1 person or a couple. Owners were very quick to assist when I had issues connecting to the internet. Area doesn't match women traveling alone.
14694692,172035548,2017-07-19,99372609,Elena,A great find. We traveled as a family with 2 kids and no car. Location for that type of vacation is amazing - short walkable distance to major attractions waterfront restaurants and public transport. The condo itself is lovely and has everything you need. The view from balcony is great and we enjoyed sitting there looking over CN tower the lake and downtown. Kids enjoyed swimming pool (outdoor). There are enough sitting by the pool for adults. There are few cabanas. If you are organized enough you could have BBQ by the pool! Erin is great host and check in and out was super easy. Will stay there again for sure. Thank you Erin.
30763132,510843160,2019-08-16,28992735,Anita,"Great location. Very well equiped. Design and clean. This apartment is perfect for visiting Toronto. 
The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is amazing. Thank you Alyssa"
36038778,502269922,2019-08-04,207328844,Mary,"Catalina was a very attentive host who responded quickly and gave very clear check in instructions.
Her apartment accommodates 4 people and I stayed there with my two teenage daughters and their friend. 
It suited our needs very well. Catalina provided us with lovely linen and the most luxurious towels.
There is one bedroom with a large and comfortable bed and a sofa bed in the living area. However if you are four older adults you may not find the sofa bed quite as comfortable. 

The only small difficulty we found was the parking. This issue is out of Catalina’s control really but worth mentioning so subsequent guests are clued up. You may park without a permit down a side street between 7am until midnight. Then you need to move your car to a paid space. There were plenty of spaces down the side streets and we  used the Green P parking lot a short way down the road just beyond Drug Supermart this also always had spaces. We choose maximum stay which took us through to 7am whereby we moved the car back to the side street.
There is an option to pay for a parking permit by visiting the city council website however you need to print the permit and we had no printing facility so this wasn’t really a viable option for us.

It was actually quite interesting seeing our location at different times of the day and I never felt unsafe. 

Feel very grateful to have been able to stay at Catalina’s apartment and experience something of Toronto."
26809807,504401432,2019-08-07,253750107,Jason,Van was such a helpful and flexible host! He was very thoughtful and generous and it was a lovely experience. All aspects of getting to the location and then getting into the BnB itself were set up so logically and the layout and decor were set up so beautifully that it made it both an easy and fun stay for us! The furnishings was clean modern and aesthetically a joy to look at. Comfortable beds with AC!  It had everything we needed for our visit and was not located too far from downtown. We would love to stay again!

We had a slight change in plans just prior to arrival - Eva and Shoop were most accommodating and provided an ""above and beyond"" level of care for which we are most appreciative.  

The apartment itself was superb - clean tastefully decorated with all the comforts of home - including a barbecue and a patio. (Sweet!)

In a great location with grocery and quality restaurants nearby this apartment is top of our list for a place to stay during a repeat visit to Toronto.

21500140,419205057,2019-03-03,241457435,Sarah,This was my first AirBnB experience so I went in not quite knowing what to expect. But the whole process was excellent. Booking and check-in were so smooth thanks to the speedy replies. The place was super well located and little touches like folded towels on each of the beds really made it feel like a home away from home. Would stay here again for sure!

32185102,544257471,2019-10-09,22542736,Maartje,"We had a lovely time and enjoyed a lot. The bathroom is amazing bed is very comfortable and there is plenty of space. The only thing we could think of to do better is the wifi. In the room it was impossible for us to get working internet. In the bathroom and upstairs it worked. 
Go here it is great"

Suggested sites and eats in the area. Condo had nice views and was clean and inviting. Would definitely stay again.
23168522,468972211,2019-06-13,66059476,Damien,"Appartement propre idéalement situé (à 2 min du métro et proche du centre) avec une PLACE DE PARKING à disposition. J’insiste sur ce dernier point car de très nombreuses rues sont payantes en ville.
Pour le reste hôte très réactif et agréable. 
Seul bémol le voisinage qui peut se faire entendre.
Pour le reste ce fut un très agréable séjour"
22644648,289535324,2018-07-12,201395701,Mason,Only stayed for one night but it was very pleasant. There is lots of space and a very comfortable couch with a tv for lounging around. The location was very quiet and parking on the street was easy to find (be mindful of the time limit 1 hour max until 7pm-7am). Check in was easy and the room was very clean.

5006252,34168779,2015-06-05,31306821,Christina,Staying at Neemas place in Liberty Village was great. The place was very nice and close to a grocery store and many restaurants. Our favorite thing about her place was the patio where we ate breakfast in the morning. The welcome book that Neema has is very informative about her place the neighborhood and helpful tips. We consulted in on many occasions. Neema was quick to answer any questions we had about the place. Although it is about 25 minutes to get to downtown from the condo the area was beautiful and we would definitely stay again. 
5958371,124776490,2017-01-02,59234906,Jordan,Great location! The place was very nice and she had everything provided which was great. She also answered every message I sent very quickly!

5671121,363348815,2018-12-28,157529342,Xin Mei,"The best thing about Sandy’s place is Sandy herself. She will make you feel at home and make sure that you have everything you need.

The place is sparkling clean and very well organized. Location is great and accessible. This place has everything you can wish for."

16387194,442015707,2019-04-22,85912805,Baradhwaj,Ros is one of the kindest and nicest people in the world. He took the time to show me around the area and took me out to eat on quite a few occasions- as someone who would choose to starve over eating out alone I am very thankful to Ros. The house itself is very welcoming. The room is spacious and clean. There is a  bus stop within a block or so of the house and there are a lot of eateries in the surrounding area.
25085926,436688040,2019-04-13,11975449,Kim,"Erika was a friendly and lovely host. From the  moment I walked in she was so warm and welcoming which started my first visit in Canada on such a positive note. She went above and beyond with helping me find and get on the public transportation.
    The house is beautiful and my  room was big and comfy. I spent just one night here but i enjoyed my stay.  It is affordable and conveniently close to the airport.
    I would recommend anybody visiting Toronto to stay here."
3873403,37671886,2015-07-09,15656226,Danette,"Our hosts Chris and Hoss are very friendly and easy to get in contact with. Hosts provide few pages of details on how to get around inside the apartment on the coffee table. Water and snacks were super thoughtful.
The listing description is very accurate. The place is so tidy and comfortable. Smart TV was great because we could watch Netflix.
It's in a very quiet and nice neighborhood. I just loved this nice little cute basement apartment so energy saving (windows around the apartment lets natural light in) and comfortable.
Seriously this is the best Airbnb place I've been so far!!! If I get a chance to go back again I'll definitely look for this place first!!!"
37720198,552484355,2019-10-21,215005543,Anju,It's was an absolute pleasure staying at Sweety's place. Her hospitality and friendliness has been a great support for us newcomers. The place itself is at a great location. It's close to many stores banks and bus-stops. The room is very spacious and clean with a decent closet and drawer to keep our stuff and guides to help is with our travel. It's near Earl Bales park which is an amazing spot to laze in and there are also small trails and a lake nearby that you should visit. In all a great experience.

28749392,428998448,2019-03-26,163845159,Marc,Benoit and Angel have created an amazing space - comfortable beautiful trendy and with a Zen minimalism but with great thoughtful touches.  The bathroom alone is an experience with their fancy toilet/ bidet that does some amazing things by remote! The proximity to the airport was helpful for us - about 7 min. I have stayed at numerous Airbnbs in Canada and the US and nothing has compared to what we experienced here.  There is a certain sophistication and recognition of what makes a great space that Benoit and Angel bring here that raises the bar very high.
26572152,432349546,2019-04-03,252568628,Farrel,A great little place in the heart of downtown Toronto. Clean quiet and comfortable. I won't hesitate to stay here again.
25266426,331015880,2018-10-01,79170946,Karina,This apartment was definitely well worth the money. I went on a girls trip to Canada for my birthday weekend. It was 3 of us but it definitely fits up to 4ppl. The beds were comfortable and the pillows were great. The view was by far my favorite part absolutely stunning. The location was great walking distance to King St which is where all the nightlife is. Was about 10min walking distance to CN tower and Ripley’s Aquarium.  Sal responded very quick to the questions. Great host and great apartment. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Canada.

He accommodated to all of our needs and was really quick with responses or any questions/concerns we may have had. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone of my friends!
20277536,557234239,2019-10-31,10101486,Amanda,This is not a luxury stay but it is perfect if you just need a place to use as home base while spending most of your time out. I was a little worried that with many rooms it might be loud or busy but everyone was quiet and very friendly when we did run into each other in the kitchen!  Everything was easy and Michal was very responsive when I had questions. Considering I stayed four nights for less than the cost of one night at any hotel in the area I’d say that’s a win!
23323891,294786568,2018-07-22,52624920,Nikoleta,Lam’s place was really cozy and nice. Communication with Lam was really good. Location to his place was easy by bus. Thanks a lot again!

21185839,346161600,2018-11-07,222112136,Bennett,The room was perfect size for 1-2 people and you can’t beat the location.
12979229,160564420,2017-06-14,6593490,Honza,Amanda was a great host the location is a bit further away from the city center however the public transport is very close (25 mins ride to the city center) or you can walk (1h 20 mins). You can find all the necessary shops pubs or services nearby and the area is generally nice and quiet. 
29035393,453675285,2019-05-16,124994066,Cristina,"Amazing place to stay!  Close to everything. 
Host was very way to communicate with. SO CLEAN!!! super cozy for
One or two people :) highly recommended!"

21107155,285730170,2018-07-04,76725004,Rose,Good location quick response but make sure check everything of the house being in tact before start settling in. 
23379027,346685421,2018-11-09,49354754,Jane,"Maxim communication was  instant and timely. The suite is exactly as described. Check in was very fast I arrived very early to Toronto and Maxim accommodated my request for early check in.
The suite has its own entrance and even though it is in the basement of the house it is airy and filled with light during the day . The only down side is from time to time you hear people moving above you but this cannot be avoided.
The  rooms were sparkling clean when we arrived and had  all the basic amenities that one would require . A coffee machine would be a much welcomed addition .
Location was perfect for me as I wanted to avoid the hustle and bustle of downtown. The airport is 10 minutes away and yet you don’t get the noise of the planes. You have easy access to all part of town . There is a bus stop close to the house but I rented a car and I would highly recommend this.
The neighbourhood is beautiful and I enjoyed my early morning runs .
All in all I would highly recommend Maxim’s place and if I am even in Toronto again I would definitely be staying here."
9495542,315401620,2018-08-28,42235587,Lorenzo,"The best experience I ever had on airbnb! Great amenities and host the room and location were exactly as described very clean  good WiFi   food  and drinks on a fully equipped kitchen and close to public transportation in a very quiet and safe neighborhood!
Feelah and his roommates were very welcoming  he even took me to see the city!!! recommend this place 100% and when I go back to Toronto I hope it's available!"
15970302,338451326,2018-10-19,136146816,Patrick,Chris’s place is absolutely lovely. Perfect location close to the CN Tower and walking distance to plenty of bars and restaurants. We couldn’t recommend this location more! Chris made the place feel like a home away from home and we felt safe in the area. Hope to come back soon.
18254263,517602986,2019-08-25,97905766,Chiara,Our stay at Johnny's was great. The place is clean and nice there's everything you need. The view is amazing! The place is a bit small for 4 but perfect for 2 I'd say :)
22361310,506381555,2019-08-10,247243339,Serena,Stay at Charlotte's was not too far from downtown but close enough to restaurants and city life. It was an easy commute in a safe neighbourhood!
34652108,519493387,2019-08-28,77656893,Felix,"This Airbnb is absolut fantastic!! We had such a great time!! To relax in the whirlpool at the evening and to watch the Ontario lake were absolutely great!! Everything was very clean we had everything we need. This Airbnb is perfect to stay for a few days to discover Toronto but you can also stay here for a few more days or a weeks because you can relax here as much as you want!! The neighborhood is absolute quite and the people are very kind. 
Tara and Tim are fantastic hosts they were very kind and friendly!! We needed some more towels and Tara bring them to us in just a second. Also it was very nice that we could stayed a few hours more on our departure day so we don’t had to wait at the airport. We were so sad as we had to leave I can still only think about the whirlpool and this beautiful backyard! We hope to come back some days!! 
All the best to you both!!!"

32381906,437960233,2019-04-15,239901912,Alisa,Good place to stay if you are looking for a good price and short walk from downtown attractions. A little older of a building and you may find dust often but overall okay.
8578715,319524420,2018-09-06,190067198,Raghavan,Fantastic location very silent beautiful and picturesque location having all the necessary amenities for families to stay long. Amazing guests that are more than welcome to host you and provide you with all the information that you require. Especially the well stocked kitchen with all that a family requires is the highlight of this house.
10355497,134361976,2017-02-26,33696992,Timothy,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

We loved talking with them and playing with their dog Roger. Rush also gave us great tips about the city and provided us cappuccinos in the morning. We will miss them for sure!
19388399,168482382,2017-07-09,63515419,Chandy,We would recommend this place to all of our friends and family. The host goes above and beyond to make sure our stay is not only comfortable but also enjoyable with all the extra amenities. We will bookmark this home to visit again.
2956154,16774159,2014-08-02,13495836,Tomohiro,Lindsay was a great host. The house is clean and I had absolutely no problems during the 1 month I stayed here. The neighborhood is quiet peaceful and convenient for getting around. I'm glad I stayed at her house.

32700902,517491487,2019-08-25,257084056,Janelle,"Location location location everything is in walking distance. A stylish condo with nice view over the city. Host contact was quick in responding from booking to Check in. We had a few cleaning issues which we have advised the host about. No pool towels included in the Condo so bring your own! 

Overall we enjoyed our time in Toronto and would stay in this area again."
16109795,315745060,2018-08-29,40654721,Jenn,We enjoyed our stay at Carole’s place. It was clean and had everything we needed. The location was the best part about our stay. Her place is within walking steps to many great restaurants shopping and tourist sites. The CN tower is literally across the street. We would recommend it to our friends. Cheers.
15271147,299262945,2018-07-30,203935691,Raphael,This is probably one of the best locations to stay in the city. Subway is close on the edge of the most posh place to live in Toronto (Yorkville). The place is probably like an Airbnb place from some years ago: Used by the host full of his / her stuff. Nicely decorated tough. Just bathroom capacities are limited due to this fact.
32503543,464855791,2019-06-06,46805544,Janet,We stayed at Ilias’s condo in early June and it is a fantastic location near Union Station. The apartment is just as pictured and the beds are very comfortable. The gym is a nice bonus too. We were just steps away from “Jurassic Park” during the NBA Finals so while it was a bit noisy it was great to be in the heart of the action. As the condo was floor to ceiling windows I would recommend a sleep mask. I highly recommend this condo and would not hesitate to stay here again.
21885109,446060224,2019-04-30,85268587,Gemma,We had a great stay at Sals. The apartment is well located clean and well equipped. Sal was available for any questions and queries and made us feel at home but we also had privacy. We would definitely stay there again if we’re back in Toronto.
1009656,182888965,2017-08-15,116737208,Michael,Well-presented basement flat in a quiet neighbourhood.  If travelling by public transport it is worth taking the bus down Dovercourt Road to Ossington subway station.  Holly and Chad were responsive and helpful hosts!
11648181,69510698,2016-04-11,61092847,Sarah,Olya's Airbnb in downtown Toronto was absolutely perfect. Great size for two people beautiful decor and easy process to check in and out. She even accommodated our flight schedules. Th space was wonderful and so was the experience!

1459100,233228965,2018-02-08,1334623,Charlie,"A really cool spot - not the usual Ikea default furniture that proliferates most Toronto Airbnb’s. Like a slightly more personal version of a boutique hotel. 

Super comfy bed Sonos and TV with Netflix good iron that worked well - everything I could have needed. Totally recommended. Possibly the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in in Toronto: and I’ve stayed in a lot!"
19133446,307070795,2018-08-13,15030104,Christo,Nice apartment very quiet and well located close to subway. Ideal to discover Toronto. Christian was here to welcome us on arrival and was present for our departure. 
26718700,325033421,2018-09-18,27189786,Unnuri,"Even though we arrived earlier than expected Pamela was very kind to us.
First I could sleep comfortably for 2 days because the accommodation was very clean.
The kitchen is well equipped with cooking utensils so I think you can cook simple foods.
The washing machine and the dryer were great.
There's a dehumidifier or air cleaner running in the living room and there's some noise.
But I didn't have any problems. I ventilated the small windows and left the machine turned off.

Cleanliness is the most important thing to me but I was very satisfied.
If I have another chance to go to Toronto I would like to choose this place again."
12836500,219456644,2017-12-17,42868091,Ala,Quick response and accommodating check in. A clean small/cozy bachelorette apartment suitable for 1 or 2 people. Note that parking is an extra $5.

The top floor bedroom and rooftop terraces were absolutely lovely and a perfect place to hang out during one of the hottest weekends yet in Toronto. Blake was a great host very friendly and helpful. Check in/out was easy and hassle-free. We would definitely recommend Blake's beautiful house to anyone visiting Toronto. Thanks Blake!
14926770,260687211,2018-05-04,184812291,Nancy,Clean nice apartment in a fantastic Yorkville location. It was perfect for us during our recent time at Hot Docs--very close to the industry headquarters and super-convenient to the subway Whole Foods (one block away!) and other amenities. Jay is super-responsive and was very kind in helping us out with various things. Highly recommended!

3197598,72906567,2016-05-05,1464711,Eric,Sanam's place was wonderful. It was central to everything - many restaurants nearby close to grocery (Loblaws) and gym (Goodlife) - yet still felt like it was on a quiet street. Would highly recommend staying here and would also consider staying here again if I could!

24262479,565529998,2019-11-17,135853319,Asia,Michael was so kind thoughtful organized and responsive. I was a little nervous as a young woman coming to stay in an unfamiliar part of town for my event and go figure I arrived in the dark of the night in the freezing cold. My fears disappeared instantly though--the key transfer worked perfectly and the suite was toasty and welcoming with a binder full of local tips and household info. Everyone in the immediate and surrounding neighbourhood left me to my own devices (which I prefer) and it was great to know the host was nearby/quick to respond to messages if we needed anything. The suite itself was super cozy and stylish and it was great having a kitchenette for making fresh light meals on our budget. We were able to walk back and forth easily to our work trip venue because of this location and that took a big load of stress off our shoulders. Having things nearby like Food Basics coffee shops local restaurants Shoppers Drug Mart a dollar store convenience stores and public transit was fantastic too. Overall this was a lovely experience.

20269906,187218827,2017-08-26,40460445,Alex,"Fotini's basement apartment is a very nice place to stay. It's conveniently located in a beautiful and safe neighbourhood full of stores and restaurants. The listing description is accurate. You can get around the city quickly and easily using the public transportation: streetcars run all the day (it's just a ~3 min walk) or you can walk to the closest subway station (~15 min walk).

You will find that Fotini is a very nice and communicative host. She is very attentive and quick to respond to your questions and requests. She was also very flexible with the check-in time. The place is brand new and has all you need for a pleasant stay in Toronto including a very nice view of the city right down the street. I definitely recommend it!"

The accommodations were upscale very comfortable and the amenities were fantastic; just as promised.   The view: stunning.  It was also great to have a parking spot not something you think about when you don't live in a big city center. I highly recommend this property and working with the owner who was great and wanted your stay to be as pleasant as possible.   I'd see if his place was available anytime I returned to Toronto.
19548931,284391777,2018-07-01,173971232,Debbie,Was an excellent location. We could walk most everywhere. Just wish the place had tv’s in each bedroom since the living room area only seats 3 comfortably. But overall value of being in such a great location is excellent. The view is great as well and we enjoyed our stay. The beds were also comfy!

Nous vous conseillons vivement de vous y arrêter lors d'un séjour à Toronto."

29944433,442845517,2019-04-24,153981071,Ervin,Sara was a great host and very easy  communicate with. Her home was beautiful and came with more than just the bare essentials. I would stay again and recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of Yorkville.
22173426,476644432,2019-06-26,102918589,Kristin,Great place. Justin was above and beyond hospitable. For a basement unit in Toronto this is actually the best it can be. Clean quiet well maintained excellent touches like a very thorough check in process and even automatic lights in the hallway which helps when navigating a new place in the dark. Would absolutely seek out to stay here again.
24095173,567858998,2019-11-23,153644610,Kate,Bedroom in a well-located home easy access to TTC. Stylish bathroom parking. Clear directions

19241807,270053012,2018-05-28,190139898,Matthew,Way beyond expectation. Perfect for my needs. A very large open comfy bachelor pad with a relaxed and hip vibe...Marc was unbelievably accommodating and communicative and a respectful host. Good guy with a fun sense of generosity. The room was private well prepared and quiet. A superb downtown hip experience.

17991171,278241842,2018-06-17,193656160,Irene,Highly recommend this place! Kyle was very accessible by message. The location was very accessible for me visiting by bus and train; also my local boyfriend had no problem finding street parking at 3am. Amazing mood lighting comfy bed stylish shower. Amenities include hot plate microwave fridge/freezer water filter dishes/mugs/utensils space heater. It's actually quite cold down there so I ran the heater the whole time but then I was very comfortable. Only con was I started walking around barefoot initially and my feet were covered in pet hair and dirt. I did find Lysol wipes and wiped all the floors myself which sucked but did the job. I also saw hairs in the top cover so I didn't use it and put it in the dresser. I told the owner this in his review and hopefully he will vacuum next time. Otherwise it was super comfy and I loved staying here. I'm probably going to book here again actually.
6908708,105626837,2016-10-02,40286989,Ann-Catherine,"It was a great place to stay for a longer period of time. The room has no daylight but for me that wasn't an issue. Anna and Glen were there when I needed something and Anna also provided a hair dryer after I asked her. The place is really clean and in the apartment are instructions about the use of most items in the kitchen and bathroom.
The apartment is located in a really nice area and everything is easy to reach either by TTC or walking. It would take you about 30 min to walk  down to Dundas Square.
The Bar downstairs wasn't a problem at all I barely heard anything from downstairs. 
I would definitely stay here again. "

21677102,214323439,2017-11-25,24020381,Andie,Miles's place was incredible the photos do not do it justice!

I would highly recommend staying with Miles!
6227042,505700558,2019-08-09,275125791,Angela,This was my first Airbnb experience and rental of this unit completely sold me on the rental concept.  This unit was EXACTLY as described in terms of location and cleanliness.  It was BETTER than expected in terms of amenities:  the kitchenette was well stocked with utensils and small appliances; the gym is huge clean and complete; the door/security staff were welcoming and helpful.  NEGATIVES that held me back from a 5 star review:  This unit uses a keyless/bluetooth entry system which was convenient and worked flawlessly.  However you still need a key fob to enter the building and to access the gym/pool areas.  This unit only came with one key fob so it takes some coordinating if your group splits for the day or does not arrive at the gym/pool at the same time.  Not a deal-breaker but it is an annoyance that could be easily remedied.  TV reception was poor if that is something you enjoy.  Finally this is a second floor unit on the street side of the building.  Street noise was audible (and at times loud!) at all hours of the night.  I am a city dweller so not a deal-breaker for me but if you are a light sleeper call dibs on the pull-out sofa in the den.
9739179,527712989,2019-09-11,250726164,Rachele,Great stay the condo was in a perfect location close to lots of shops food and entertainment. Robin provided lots of info for the stay. Check in was very smooth.

16136016,492788424,2019-07-21,42643520,Vinay,"Nice AirBnB but not exactly pictured. The balcony is much smaller and there was a lot of wood on it when we arrived so we couldn't really enjoy it much. And the doors inside the unit are pretty messed up. Hard to lock the doors and a few of our guests literally got stuck inside one of the bedrooms and we had to figure out how to open the door. Locksmith had to come twice to repair the doors. One of the toilet seats was also broken. The water tank must be small can't really shower back-to-back.

It's located in a decent area with lots of things to do but the interior of the unit needs some work."

6044426,401461027,2019-01-14,164297712,Cristiane,"What a perfect place after a long trip from Brazil.
I only wish I could have stayed longer. 
Lily was amazing  patient and so very helpful. 
She was there when i arrived. She even helped me with my luggage. 
She was kind friendly and gracious.

The location is amazing.
The place is gorgeous.
The view is fantastic. Best view ever!
Everything about this place was meticulously maintained with an obvious attention to detail you don't find in many places.

i would recommend this place to anyone and everyone visiting the Toronto area."
21668496,432319514,2019-04-03,183611827,Vladislav,Very beautiful condo everything was amazing. 10/10.
13506547,433077942,2019-04-05,8737918,Janae,"James & Julie saved me when I needed a place very last minute. I had checked into another Airbnb and it was absolutely filthy and I couldn’t stay there. They are able to accommodate my son and I quickly. Was a life saver! 

Nice little basement suite had everything my son and I needed. Washer and dryer was a saving grace & loads of kitchen equipment too! Quiet home would love a little floor lamp in the living room maybe to brighten it up in that one space. 

Was super clean and private. Would recommend it to anyone. 

Oh bed was comfy as well and the sofa was quiet large my 6 year old slept there as his room quite happily!!"
15853135,332110814,2018-10-04,60218496,Debra,"Always an excellent stay with Tom and Galina.  Great hosts who go
above and beyond - really appreciated and looking forward to our next stay."
12337986,70832727,2016-04-21,25415209,Heather,Karyn and Fernando are wonderful hosts. They are friendly and inviting and provided great restaurant recommendations along with things to see and do (the AGO is really close!). The loft is beautiful. Has everything you can possibly think of including a huge deck to enjoy the lovely spring weather a comfortable bed and nespresso machine. The location in little Italy is perfect. The streetcar is right outside your door and you are steps away from amazing restaurants like bar raval shopping in Kensington market and queen street and everything else Toronto has to offer. We really couldn't have asked for more. It's like home but in a much cooler city. We had a wonderful stay and can't wait to come back. Oh and if hats are your thing then you will really enjoy karyn's shop lilliput hats on the street level of the building. Beautiful! So fun to experience artisans making beautiful creations.
13415314,188808461,2017-08-30,147629025,Marjorie,Magnifique séjour. Merci. Super propre central et à proximité de tout ! Parfait pour une petit famille comme nous.
20615662,454122925,2019-05-17,119151707,Stephanie,It was easy to find and approx 10-15mins from the airport which is what we were after. Check in was easy by lock box. The place is very spacious and decorated nicely. The bathroom could have been cleaner there were hairs that wasn’t ours some mould on the ceiling and some grime it didn’t look like the shower basin on sink had been cleaned before we arrived. The rest of the space was very clean. The space is in the basement so you can hear footsteps upstairs unfortunately we heard them until gone 1am. The bedroom was very cold and the duvet thin so this didn’t help to try to get to sleep. There is a whole kitchen however no kettle. I never saw the host so cannot comment other than there was a very quick reply to the booking in regards to check in info and WiFi details. Overall it was an okay stay. We just needed to stay somewhere before our 7am flight and it did well enough for it.
28806273,458957804,2019-05-26,187185131,Summer,The location was awesome! A block away from Union station which the airport train drops you off at and you have access to the city from there (subway street car and PATH). One block the other direction you are at waterfront and a Tim Horton's. We came for a Jays game it was walking distance. The Condo was well kept and quiet. Doesn't have a lot of privacy within so be comfortable with you you are staying with. Also a high rise being built right in front of view but interesting to watch the crane operator's skill.
32046499,512552706,2019-08-18,1800284,Erin,We were really happy with Jacqui's place! It's very close to the subway station and was very clean. We know the area as we go to Toronto often to visit family so we were happy to be around some of our favourite cafes bars and restos. This place was very good value too because it's got a main living room / kitchen area  which is nice to hang out in with the bedroom upstairs. For those who have mobility issues there are 2 narrow/steep sets of stairs in this apartment so it is something to be aware of. The communication and check in/check out was easy.
15531995,559726437,2019-11-04,88210072,Rabab & Arman,Lillian and Michael are so friendly and hospitalbe. Very generous peaple! The  room was clean and very private. The neighborhood is in a great and safe location. Thank you Lillian and Michael for everything :)

33285128,556001804,2019-10-28,14813083,Robert,Anja is a great host friendly and helpful.  She went out of her way to orient us to the transit system even walking with me to the payment machine to help me navigate the options. She is friendly and very responsive to communications. Walking distance to many places to eat. Enigma Cafe with superb all daybreakfast just around the corner is a must.
36848859,559125111,2019-11-03,196070289,Manu,Beautiful place to stay ! My friends and I will definitely be back !
20590984,298725418,2018-07-29,7110022,Jessica,"Perfect AirBnB. I would book here again. The most impressive aspect was how quickly the host responded (within seconds/minutes!). 

The place was very nice and it was great that there was parking inside the building (for an extra $15/night) which was perfectly fine. 

The place was right beside the eaton centre so a very convenient location. 

Thank you!"
8473294,114849619,2016-11-20,89222947,Brad,The listing was exactly as pictured and described simply gorgeous. Everything you could need is provided. Neighbourhood holds up to the reviews it's truly close to everything. Host is kind and communicative!

Only is it beautiful but it had everything we needed and in a great location. Close to everything and easy access as well. Greg was very easy to get in contact with and flexible during our arrangement which was great. Would 100% recommend this place if you’re looking for a great place in Toronto."

19826911,476201613,2019-06-25,1188531,Johann,Great location with an amazing view. Perfect if you want to be in the heart of Toronto.
29704947,519970794,2019-08-29,21900070,Alf,This property is in the absolute perfect location when visiting/exploring downtown Toronto. You are  an $10 cab/Uber ride or 25 minute walk from Billy Bishop airport. All major attractions are only minutes away. The condo is super quiet!! The condo has all the basics for cooking etc. (However I chose to eat at some of the many eateries within walking distance.
27462315,477589039,2019-06-28,22190025,Fadi,Great place . Very clean. Love the terrace
16437963,412067250,2019-02-14,6615278,Sylvia,Place was as described. Convenient location and great host. Thanks!
3703115,39752578,2015-07-26,32759324,Kayley,"We had a great experience at this beautiful apartment. Jason was very helpful providing dinner recommendations and showing us around the apartment as soon as we got there. The location was amazing and close to all the best spots in Toronto just as his listing said. 

Only complaint we had was the lack of cooking utensils in the kitchen. We had a large group so we ended up staying in and cooking for a couple meals to save some money for our nights out. Wouldn't have been a problem if we had known we should bring some of those things. 

Overall really great experience. Thanks Jason!"
13083546,182767450,2017-08-15,73973093,Jason,This place was a key part of our holiday as a family of six and it certainly did not disappoint during our 9-day stay. It is enormous and highly specified. Our flight was delayed on arrival but our host was happy for us to check ourselves in late at night - and we greatly appreciated this flexibility. The decor and facilities are amazing and the environment was a residential oasis only a few minutes drive from the bustling Jonge Street and 30 mins from Downtown Toronto. A fabulous luxury residence. Highly recommended.
3464606,41574843,2015-08-08,13617655,Francesca,My stay at Harry's was wonderful. The room is extremely spacious and clean. The bed is so comfortable. The apartment was perfectly located: walking distance from the city center and the distillery district. Harry was always available and accommodating. Really nice to chat with him. He also gave me great advices to explore the city. Thanks for everything you are a great host!
12602468,262017366,2018-05-07,10712887,Kristin,Debbie's place was ideal for a conference that I had to attend at the Toronto Convention Center. While there were a few hotels near the convention center the prices were often steep; and the other hotels were a 15 min walk. Debbie's apt was a great location then for me to have some quiet separation from work but still very accessible (2-3min) to the center. Clean great view and comfortable.
24868916,367768467,2019-01-05,182645733,Vamika,Great place!

13528522,193726466,2017-09-14,118779893,Mohona,I had a longish stay in Lise and John's studio apartment and the whole experience was fabulous! I would do it again in a heartbeat! So If you are looking for a place which is extremely well appointed centrally located - literally a stone's throw from supermarkets grocery store cafes and public transport walking distance from the university of Toronto and many other such places this is the place for you. What makes it special is the care and the warmth that Lise exudes.  She is extremely accomodating and a wonderful human being to deal with and to know. This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was wonderful! Highly recommended
1638995,94360111,2016-08-15,241287,Scott,I absolutely loved my stay at Clarence's place. Everything was easy and seamless from the communication leading up to my stay to the key hand off to the check out. I loved the apartment. It was absolutely gorgeous and the patio was amazing. The shower was to die for. The location is incredible and within easy walking distance to some of my favorite bars and restaurants. I really hope to stay at Clarence's place again. Thanks so much for a wonderful stay!

6104093,305030580,2018-08-10,27473681,Anna,I can’t say enough good things about Suzy’s place- it was absolutely perfect! Check in was a breeze the neighborhood was amazing and the apartment was wonderful! It had everything we needed (and more!) as well as tips for local spots to visit. Suzy and the dogs were a joy to meet as well! We truly enjoyed our stay here and recommend it to everyone! Thanks again Suzy!
28368298,335226450,2018-10-11,46615946,Rebecca,Amazing stay! Snagged a great last minute deal but had absolutely everything I needed including parking.
37116593,538289453,2019-09-29,283450488,Aaliyah,Nadia’s house is modern and very clean. She went above and beyond making sure the house was filled with day to day things (shower essentials toilet paper coffee tea and more). Nadia went way above my expectations to accommodate everything my group needed. Check in and check out were both quick and easy. Nadia’s responses to my messages were speedy and helpful. Could not have asked for a better host or house.
6973941,351111797,2018-11-21,173104442,Emily,Great space located in a fun glitzy part of downtown Toronto. Glad we chose to stay here!

20640178,262633127,2018-05-09,88536644,Sebastien,As expected - great location and host.
13992933,100678361,2016-09-10,3548951,Ben,"Didn't hear from the host until about 45mins before I was meant to check-in which was a little disconcerting as I was entering the city. I was about 20mins away from assuming I had to cancel and find a hotel. 

Once checked in though Eric was very responsive and easy to communicate with. The place was clean and had the essentials—comfortable enough but not somewhere you'll want to spend your spare time relaxing around. 

If you're spending most of your time downtown count on a $20-$35 cab ride each way depending on traffic."
16466271,184432640,2017-08-19,141029555,Sepideh,I couldn't be more satisfied. Sahil and Priya were great hosts. The condo is in a great spot right next to Union station. And having Langos supermarket right down the building makes your stay so convenient. Highly Recommended.

The backyard is very cute with a fish pond and hot tub. Ann and Dave are super nice and easy to communicate. We enjoyed the stay.

20306769,304026758,2018-08-08,15616566,Bilal,"Roy place was wonderful. Nice living room. House is equipped with AC during this heatwave we stayed nice and cool. Beautiful backyard. 


On the negative sides - Washrooms are very tight so if your on the plus side this may not work for you. 
Host takes a pictures of ID I am a victim of fruad and this type of things scare me. I advised him that I don’t feel comfortable with it he told me he will cancel this reservation and we can find a new one. 
Wi-Fi is intermittent. Mostly used my data during the visit. 

Overall was not worth the amount money listed for.

18613334,262020190,2018-05-07,28623368,Alia,"Fabian's apartment has one of the most beautiful views ever. It's high and sweeping with big windows. The bed was super comfortable the room clean and pleasant with plenty of space for our stuff. The building is very secure; we felt comfortable coming and going even late at night. Its quiet and cozy and reasonably priced right next to Union Station and a few short blocks from the Harbourfront. We'd stay there again any time. 

Thank you Fabian (and Selina) for a wonderful visit!"

21281926,242205869,2018-03-11,91705534,Connor,Apartment was very stylish and exactly as it appeared in pictures! Be careful if you have a car with you though as Toronto has very difficult street parking bylaws. Thank you for a great stay in your beautiful home Félix!!
12955428,315354224,2018-08-28,20925572,Tina,Susan is a great host she welcomed us in person even we had a really late arrival and kindly supplied us with groceries in the fridge and arranged the parking permit .Her place is beautifully decorated and well facilitied. It is a short walk to the subway station to explore the downtown. It is also very close to a local park which has a playground my two little ones had a good play there. Greek Town is very close by it has a great range of shops and restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and had a great time in Toronto. We will definitely recommend Susan's place.

The property was incredible - clean and high in the sky with a view that is to die for. They had a smart TV that we used for Netflix and a small kitchenette and a spacious bathroom. All in all the space was amazing I’d highly recommend this property and these hosts to anyone that wants to stay here in the future.

20710043,291839036,2018-07-16,59838475,Amy,This really is a beautiful sanctuary! I really appreciated the simple modern aesthetic of the apartment. It was also very clean and tidy which is a huge win in my book. The only problem was that the apartment only has a few small windows and so it got very stuffy even at night. There is no A/C and only 2 ceiling fans (1 in the large bedroom and 1 in the kitchen) so be prepared to borrow a fan from a friend if you're visiting in the summer!
13111728,278132514,2018-06-17,50754441,Jake,Clean and comfortable place. Good spot near the water and public transport by streetcar. You’ll need to Uber or steetcar into town it’s not walkable — but there are nice restaurant-lined streets nearby which you can get to. Bathroom is also clean and decent with a second toilet available to guests. You’re sharing with a bunch of other private rooms so be aware of this. We were fine but others mentioned they weren’t expecting it. Family are great Kate is lovely — all was very easy to come and go as we please. Would stay again!
14873227,174344980,2017-07-25,6119554,Francesca,The room and facilities were just as described and Julie was always very quick to respond. Her place is very close to the transit stop and down a very quiet street. Julie was very welcoming and accommodating particularly when we needed somewhere to leave our cases for a few hours before/after checkout. We really enjoyed chatting to her and loved the choice at breakfast. Her dog Pip was also very friendly and cute! We wholeheartedly recommend her place to anyone looking for a private room in Toronto.

The rooftop patio was great and the view was beautiful especially on a sunny day! The host was non-invasive which was great but it was sometimes awkward when using common areas. However we were provided with everything we needed and the bed sheets and towels were freshly washed and dried for us when we arrived. Thank you!

Puedes obtener lo mínimo indispensable para vivir porque se encuentran tiendas muy cerca. Me agradó que es un lugar seguro.
Sólo sugiero que al ver los programas de televisión puedan tener diferentes idiomas para disfrutarlos.
El clima dentro de la casa es agradable.
En la cocina puedes cocinar lo que gustes porque tiene lo indispensable para realizar algún platillo. La lavadora y secadora funciona muy bien en la sala es muy placentero disfrutar de un gran descanso en el baño disfrutamos de un jacuzzi y gran detalle el pensar en bebés y mujeres en los dormitorios se duerme súper agusto ya que cuenta con colchones y almohadas súper cómodas. 
Recomiendo ampliamente la estancia en esa casa que está muy acogedora y agradecemos la estancia que fue muy placentera y segura."
15713961,251805694,2018-04-08,1547017,Sophie,"We really enjoyed our stay at this place. The location is good close to the Eaton center and all kinds of little places to eat.
Rebecca responded to all our messages and questiones right away.
The only thing to keep in mind when booking this place is that the stairs are fairly steep and whenever someone is walking on the top floor you can hear it on the lower one.
Other than that a very decent place to stay which we would recommend."

The bathroom is stocked if you happened to need anything. The kitchen has everything you'd possibly need although with this great location you'll might end up eating out all the time. To get to Downtown the 24h streetcar runs just around the corner and there's only a short walk to the subway. 
Adam and Jessica are amazingly welcoming and warm-hearted. They really made us feel like home. We had soooo many questions about the city and life in Canada in general and every single time we got priceless advice. It was truly something you can not get from any tourist guide! 
Adam and Jessica Thank you once again :)"

7970039,507309194,2019-08-11,51263575,Jay,I was a bit skeptical when I arrived because the outdoors of the apartment wasn’t what I had expected. But boy was I wrong! The apartment was nice and clean. I asked M if he could take extra caution and make sure it was very clean because I have allergies he did so. The view from the balcony was spectacular and the location was great. Just a 16 min walk to the LCBO grocery stores and a lot of other places also close to Downtown . This will definitely be my go to spot when I’m back in Toronto. Affordable and worth it!

The apartment is nice and clean and quite large for a basement. The kitchen is fully equipped so making your own meals is easy. Theres also a washer and dryer which were excellent. 

Overall I would recommend this space to anyone coming to Toronto.

23339656,325788693,2018-09-20,188258516,Ravi Shankar,"1) A clean place in a safe neighbourhood 10-15 Mins from Finch  (Route 125 or 36A west bound- stop Grantbrook st + 10 mins walk) or Sheppard-Yonge (Route 98C towards Peckham - stop Charlton blvd + 5 mins walk) subway station by bus.
2) This basement apartment allows complete privacy and is perfect for single traveller's long stay with all private amenities - bathroom gym room kitchen washer & dryer closet sofa single bed and a TV (you could stream from your laptop).
3) Al is a great host and helps out with local knowledge and does not interfere unless you ask for help.   Neighbours help you with directions as well.
4) Do not keep the front door open for too long as there is lush greenery few metres from the house and insects may enter.

Enjoy your time in Toronto!"

985072,104800332,2016-09-28,1158030,Justin,Host was responsive to questions and helpful. The location was great for my needs and I enjoyed exploring the neighborhood. It was convenient having a separate entrance. Street parking only and you'll need to get a parking pass online. It's easy enough to do but keep it in mind if have a car. The ceiling is low but even at 6' (1.83m) tall it didn't bother me and I did not feel claustrophobic.

Very clean well-equipped apartment. In the back of a house and the backyard is quite unkempt. Very little natural light as windows look out to house next door. 

For the price probably would have preferred a high end apartment or hotel."

15051450,283840150,2018-06-30,63649167,Sarah,We stayed at Diane's place for 2 weeks when first moving to Toronto. The apartment was very clean and well equipped and Diane and her family made us very welcome right from the start helping us with our very heavy bags and making sure we had everything we needed. The apartment is in a great location - peaceful street with beautiful old houses only 5 minutes down to the lake shore and boardwalk. Queen Street East is at the bottom of the road with shops bars and restaurants and the 501 streetcar which takes you into downtown in 30 minutes. We loved our stay in the beach and Diane was a great host. Thanks Diane

It is a little small if you are traveling more than 3 people. King Street West is right in the heart of downtown Toronto which made finding things easier. If I ever come Toronto again I shall be using Matthews services!

17776638,490456948,2019-07-18,226919838,Jhonatan,Es un lugar en un barrio tranquilo cerca del metro y a paso de la estación del autobús pero no es un lugar limpio en lo absoluto hay muchas cucarachas la puerta del baño no cierra la entrada no tiene cerradura de seguridad las camas son muy viejas. Le falta mantenimiento al lugar. Pero es amplio

9797332,406980148,2019-01-31,128880436,Hamilton (Gregory),"My friend and I stayed here for 4.5 months when we first moved to Canada and it was perfect. Kfir and Devin could not have been more welcoming and helpful they always responded extremely quickly and made us feel very settled.

The space itself is great; it was very clean nicely decorated it had good amenities there is a private front door off of the entry hall and it genuinely felt like home. Both bedrooms are a good size with ample storage space the bathroom has a separate washer and dryer which was ideal and the kitchen has all the utensils you need to cook properly.

The location was incredible having not known much about the area beforehand we were amazed at how much was on our door step it's one of the best neighbourhoods in the city. The house itself is down a lovely peaceful street with a myriad of restaurants cafes shops and bars just a 3 minute walk away.

Probably the best Airbnb experience I've had. In fact we loved it so much that we had originally only booked for 1 month but extended it to 4.5 months after only being there a couple of days. I can't recommend it enough."
10042369,248102573,2018-03-30,81370782,Johnson,The view is really nice outside.  My was very accommodating in terms of letting guests prior to check-in know or ask any details etc.  I would say that it is very good for big groups from 6-8 people.  I would advise for future guests who stay here if you call any Ubers to either suggest them to the back of the condo or to walk a block towards the Air Canada Centre then call it there because sometimes the mass amount of traffic on weekends or peak hours can cause the price to go up and sometimes you may get stuck.  Funny part was that there seems to be a nicely.. collected amount of fresh soda beverages in the fridge which was pleasant!  I would recommend and come back to this place in the future.
37908422,565515225,2019-11-17,158134026,Israel,The place is very nice and as this is a shared acomodation you hear people around.

28543893,468449280,2019-06-12,24839377,Richard,Viseh’s condo is ideally located very close to the Scotiabank Arena CN Tower Rogers Centre and all downtown attractions. The place is very clean easy to find and being on a higher floor the views of the city and even lake are fabulous. I would recommend it.

We enjoyed discovering the Upper Beach neighbourhood and the 10 minute walk to the beach (and Beach Village). The apartment is comfortable and quiet with a very nice and private patio to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening. Easy access to and from downtown by public transit or Uber. Overall a great experience!

Appartement entièrement refait et très propre. Il est bien équipé et il ya même céréales et café/thé pour se préparer un rapide petit déjeuner.
Quelques bémols :
Le quartier n'est pas le plus chic de Toronto (chinatown) mais nous n'avons pas mon plus de mauvaises rencontres en rentrant le soir.
L'appartement manque lumière extérieure il faut allumer la lumière même en pleine journée ce qui est un peu dommage.
A noté un très bon restaurant de raviolis chinois à 2 pas avec plats à emporter (dumplig house) ça peut toujours dépanner..."
9624234,126643246,2017-01-13,74822555,Brenda,This apartment was clean and had all the basics. The coffee machine great wifi connection and tv were perks.   George was a great host.  Check in and out were easy and flexible.

5037911,489361658,2019-07-16,86167165,T,"Location location location - this is a great place to stay while visiting Toronto because it is walking distance to so much and close to public transportation for the rest. The beds were comfy kitchen well equipped and the bathrooms were modern and very clean with lovely showerheads and plentiful hot water. The host was very responsive. 
There are quite steep stairs to the main living space (just a single flight) which may be difficult for someone who is physically frail. We had an issue with air-con which was resolved within a day by the host. Our teenagers enjoyed having their own downstairs level and ensuite bathroom. I recommend this Airbnb."

Communication with Lydia was great and check-in was efficient. This is a good no frills spot and would be suitable for anyone looking for good value for a central location.

17666143,210302684,2017-11-08,143803494,Isis,The locations was fine nice quiet residential neighbourhood. There are many rooms in the hotel so if your a light sleeper you'll probably have some trouble. Also check your room out for cleanliness :/ Never met the hosts but there were very understanding and responsive before I arrived.

8274319,253464855,2018-04-14,49585593,Genevieve,One of the great things about Bob's place is that you have a very comfortable and well-appointed bedroom with your own ensuite bathroom.  Everything is sparkling clean.  Best of all Bob is very helpful.  Having arrived in the dark and lacking an inner sense of direction Bob was quick to respond to my need for directions and he even came outside with his little dog Charlie to be sure I found the garage.  I highly recommend Bob's place.
12290314,164144463,2017-06-26,110345136,John,Jeffrey's place was amazing. Location is second to none with brilliant views of Toronto. Check in was quick and easy also. Overall a great place and would definitely return.

The neighbourhood is great especially the small bakeries and the public transport into downtown is also pretty convenient.

The place itself is exactly as seen in the pictures... very clean (especially the bathroom) and except for a fully equipped kitchen we had everything we needed.

All in all there we enjoyed our stay very much and are looking forward to another stay in Toronto at Tracy & Kate's as soon as possible!"

It was very clean stylish comfortable and the location was perfect - a walking distance from the touristic part of Toronto yet in a calm and quiet neighborhood setting. Vincent was very quick to reply to my messages and he was always very helpful in giving tips. I definitely recommend this place!
12447108,262634038,2018-05-09,33863581,Katherine,Stella's place was exactly as advertised and the perfect place to stay on a business trip. It is centrally located and the check-in/check-out process was seamless.
24540287,330358821,2018-09-30,469797,Nicola,Overall good. Location is great and bed is comfy. Footsteps from above sounds like a small elephant walking around even with ear plugs in. So if you are a light sleeper and are planning to sleep in beware as we were awake from 7am Friday with the noise. Mirror is small and in an inconvenient place of the tiny hall outside the bathroom  so it was difficult to get ready efficiently (we were in TO for a wedding). Suggestion would be to put a mirror above the desk. But nice bed and good dark blinds and quiet from street noise.
14077682,282161785,2018-06-26,152550828,Muhammed,Just as advertised maybe even better.
6755327,534398818,2019-09-22,74910377,Matthew,Great spot! Super close to downtown and it was very comfortable for the 6 of us

29820703,481841271,2019-07-05,63130116,Marty,Brooke’s place is so much better than going to a (Website hidden by Airbnb) has 2 bathrooms and nice kitchen.  It is in an almost new building and in excellent condition as well as being very clean.  There are window walls in the LR and BR and a lovely city skyline twinkling at night.  The king-sized bed is a rare find that made our stay so comfortable! Garage parking is wonderful as well.  This is located only a block away from the subway and steps from a Tim Horton so you can get your morning coffee on your way to sightseeing in Toronto!  Also just a stone’s throw is the Fairview Mall with lots of wonderful shops restaurants and food court  (I had fantastic tofu with eggplant at the Chinese restaurant in the food court).  There is a walk across the mall parking lot of course though.  But if you want to park your car and leave it and still have all these conveniences you can’t beat this place.  And in Toronto with the traffic issues it’s just wonderful to be able to do that!  Brooke herself repeatedly assures you that you can contact her any time if you need any help. We did not use the other amenities of the condo building like the gym so we can’t comment on them but surely some will find those things icing on the cake.
5959077,285412567,2018-07-03,168733835,Chip,"The place was just as described.  Excellent location very clean ideal for ""couples stay.""  My wife and I had a great 3 night stay.  Within walking distance from almost everything.  There is a market to buy groceries about 300 feet away.  We took an Uber to a concert over at Budweiser Stage but other than that walked to Harbor Front Second City restaurants etc.  The best meal we had was at Shore Club (they must not be paying Trip Advisor or (Hidden by Airbnb) because didn't show up but was excellent!).  Vahan was extremely responsive and helpful!  I would highly recommend this unit."

Very impressive and will try to stay here again when coming to Toronto.

The bed is comfortable the kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom is in a great state recently reformed with laundry and clothes dryer machines. Oh and there also good books available for the guests. The heat functions appropriately although the air gets too dry inside the house so the use of a humidifier is suitable.

Moreover the house is located near the subway and bike stations and it's very easy to get transportation for every part of the city."

Would absolutely stay again!"
28336592,333746845,2018-10-07,67513140,Ebonie,First off  amazing amazing and amazing location for anyone who is attending an event at the Scotiabank Arena. As soon as I steeped out of Areek’s place the Scotiabank Arena was smacked dead in front of my face. I’m know mathematician but I would estimate it was 300 feet away.  Secondly As far as Areek’s property it was wonderful. Areek made my first time experience using airbnb a smooth and positive experience. He was very accommodating to myself and family that wanted  to check in earlier. He gave very clear detailed instructions to enter the property along with instructions to finding the parking spot (which was included in the rental). The decor in his condo was trendy and with an open concept. Ideal property for couples since both bedrooms were on opposite sides of the living room. It felt like the condo was soundproof because I did not hear any neighbors above or below. Lastly I I00 % recommend this property. I plan on visiting Toronto in the near future and I will plan my dates around the availability of Areek’s property.
5746685,98612001,2016-08-31,25561335,Lauren,"Fantastic unit in an incredible  neighbourhood!! Devin and Kfir were remarkable hosts and go above and beyond to ensure you have everything you need for your stay.

The unit itself is very comfortable nicely renovated and easy to love. The in-suite laundry is a huge bonus and the soaker style tub is great for unwinding. 

Close to every amenity the beautiful restaurants of Ossington and other great spots like Trinity Bellwoods and Queen west. 

Would highly recommend this unit for your stay in Toronto!"

18617935,503776635,2019-08-06,51091957,Elena,You will not regret this amazing lovely abode tucked away into one of the nicest neighborhoods the city has to offer. Just one rail car ride away to the downtown area it really allows for an accessible location. While we did get stumped by the amenities like how to use the particular model for the washer and dryer I will just chalk it up to being used to a seperate model. Otherwise great place and it really allowed for us to focus on being there comfortably and happily.
14118230,186144861,2017-08-23,71680,Adrian,Apartment was the perfect spot for our family of four (2 adults 2 children). Location was good - coffee shop right next door; easy walks to the subway and many many restaurants; and also lots of things in longer walking distance which we also enjoyed. Apartment was super clean and not missing a single amenity...the washer/dryer was a big plus if you like to travel light! Kids loved having Netflix to watch during our downtime. Hyla was a great host and communicator. Highly recommend!

Il a fait en sorte que nous nous sentions comme à la maison et nous a donné tous les conseils pour que nous puissions réussir nos visites.

Son appartement regroupe tous les avantages :

19863164,262344373,2018-05-08,62180174,Margaret,"My stay was very comfortable and everything worked smoothly. I never met Simona personally but she unobtrusively checked that everything was ok via a message and then quickly answered a few questions. 

This is a perfect place for a conference at the convention center.  I was able to have a quick healthy breakfast in the apartment because of the kitchen instead of going out every morning. The walk to the convention center was short and easy. 

The apartment itself was very quiet clean and neat. The kitchen had the basics you'd need to do a bit of cooking and even a pantry with some staples (not sure if they were left behind by other travelers because it was an interesting assortment but that meant I had a starting point).

Overall I felt like I was staying in the apartment of a friend or relative who didn't happen to be at home but was comfortable with me using their stuff."
4490925,85235020,2016-07-10,58608487,Mitesh,"-Outstanding location near Union Station UP Express Longo's CN Tower Rogers Stadium Waterfront Ripley’s Aquarium Jack Layton Ferry Terminal St. Lawrence Market Eaton Centre and restaurants.
-Clean and comfortable unit with basic bathroom supplies/towels provided.
-Unit size and 1 bathroom make it ideal for 2 adults + 1 child.
-Some pics a little outdated; no wall shelf in dining area and no computer desk/printer in LR or BR.
-Booking: Immediate friendly responses from Jerry/Nat on this our first Airbnb rental.  Our personal contact was a brief 5 min informational chat with Nat.
-Check-in: issue due to room not ready on time incomplete instructions and having to wait.  Nat apologized.
-Check-out: issue due to next renter not able to find key in lockbox but then later found it.  Nat apologized.
-Overall:  great rental if no issues with check-in/out and early morning construction noise or late-night weekend partier's noise from hallway."

10773794,238411062,2018-02-25,168830846,Andrea,An amazing cozy place to stay for six with a nice sized balcony. It has a different type of layout which makes it unique and has been revamped. The bathroom was to die for.  Steps away from everything you need. Easy to communicate with hosts and an amazing place overall.

Building seemed secured and neighbours were very friendly - it's also perfectly located for exploring Little Portugal Bellwoods and Ossington. Jenna and Craig were very responsive and check in and check out couldn't have been easier.

25807242,446929529,2019-05-02,54626057,Bernadette,Lisa's place was exactly as published.  The kitchen was very well equipped and the cozy living room with fireplace was very inviting.  The plants and orchids made me feel as if it were my home and I wish the weather had been warmer because we really wanted to experience her lovely back yard.  We will definitely recommend this place.
4708992,49110327,2015-10-01,32072746,Arnaud,Chambre parfaite pour un couple a proximité  de tout le parking au sous sol est très pratique. Raghu est très discret nous l'avons peu vu pendant notre séjour.... Mais toutes les indications pour notre arrivée et notre séjour étaient claires

23168522,509516061,2019-08-14,11341444,Maria,We stayed 3 nights and only were in the apt. for sleeping so it worked well for us. It is small but the location is good with a subway stop one block away. We did not use the kitchenette at all but it is available if needed. Several places nearby for breakfast coffee and lunch or dinner. The off street parking place was great as we did not want to use our car in the city. it is a good value in an expensive city. Thank you John!
21827153,247444165,2018-03-28,111653626,Ana,Great space location and view. Kamil was easy to get in touch with and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Location is less than five minute walk to ACC which was perfect since we were there for a sporting event. Thanks for the hospitality definitely recommend.
23340001,289584433,2018-07-12,196777292,Rickida,Staying with Tim was great! Always replied straightaway and gave helpful tips for things to do and places to eat. He was respectful during my stay and allowed me to use the kitchen if I needed too. I saw him everyday of my stay and we had good conversation about our day and other things. Tim met me at Union Station even though my train was delayed by 1 hour and a half with no issue at all. Bed and pillows are firm but comfortable allowing for a goodnights sleep. The bedroom does not have any windows but this was already known prior to staying.  There was a slight problem in accessing the property as I forgot to ask the door number but Tim responded in a timely manner and the concierge in the building was also very helpful in gaining access. The condo is located on King Street. A very good location to discover Toronto all within walking distance if you're into walking.  Union Station CN Tower markets and the Harbour front are all within reasonable walking distances. Streetcars are also easily accessible from the condo. All in all I enjoyed my stay with Tim and should I return to Toronto I would stay there again. I'd recommend staying with Tim!!

The view of the city is cool with big windows

Be sure to follow Vasilys directions for parking carefully as it can be a maze in the parking garage."

29548991,415371526,2019-02-22,59515444,Kunga,"this airbnb is beautiful and has amazing pool and hot tub on the same floor. does not have a street parking even tho it might be stated on her page every once in a while whenever ahe feels like puting it up then taking it off. if you are looking to wash something make sure to bring your own laundry detergent shampoo and conditioner for whatever container there maybe available i promise you its some foreign soap in it. the 24/7 service is a lie more like whenever i feel like talking to you and helping you out. 
beside all this the apt itself was beautiful location was prime just Sophie was not too pleasant."

The apt is located close to kensington market with a lot of bars and restaurants. Public transport is also very accessible. 

Mo provides a very clean space with all you can wish for. The room facing the street can get a bit noisy at night but earplugs are provided.

Mo was extremely responsive and nice! I would definitely recommend staying at his apartment.

14724836,123490832,2016-12-29,52676916,Graham,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Sherri's house near Park Lawn Road.  We were a party of 8 adults and the house seemed purpose-built for a group our size.  The large kitchen which is well appointed and easy for several people to work in at the same time opens into a large comfortable family room.  Both spaces look out onto the large back lawn which extends down to Mimico Creek - this would be fabulous during the summer.

Sherri was a terrific host. We arrived on Christmas Eve and Sherri had taken the trouble to decorate the house (complete with Christmas tree). The house was well stocked and Sherri responded very quickly to all communications.

Thank you Sherri for a wonderful stay!"
27931137,492867584,2019-07-21,211141836,Tahnee,Nolan's place is perfectly located very stylish and well set up.  It was a great space for our family of 4. The building is very safe and within walking distance to everything. The parking space included is a huge plus. The neighborhood is quiet and trendy. Nolan is very quick to respond to any questions and inquiries. We would book with Nolan again if we ever find ourselves in the city.
26084868,284490491,2018-07-01,54636714,Brandon,Dollina’s place was amazing!  I’ve stayed in many AirBnBs but this home was the best one ever.  Everything is brand new and spotless.  The sitting room was bright and very relaxing.  The bathroom was magnificent and the shower is big.  The bed is super comfortable.  I’ve never seen a more gorgeous kitchen!  Dollina thought of everything and supplied me with anything I needed.  It was quiet and peaceful yet close to all amenities.  Her place is pretty much perfect!
17916057,172042741,2017-07-19,138269006,Hanr,Nice and comfortable place to stay.
33775044,538264088,2019-09-29,68534376,Angus,"Excellent and very friendly hosts.  You must eat at their restaurant downstairs.  I took two friends there for dinner and everyone was impressed with the food and service.  
My room was spotlessly clean.  I didn't mind going down the hall to my private bathroom.  The bed was firm just as Christopher had promised.  (I have back issues and require a firm bed.)  
In room A there is no closet but there are hangers.  I simply opened up the ironing board and used it to hang things.  Not a problem.
We have already booked a return visit in November.  There are a number of things on the restaurant's menu that I want to try.
Thanks again Christopher and Fei."
21816249,474787165,2019-06-23,234583057,Alex,The place was very cute and clean! Check-in was very simple and we had all the resources for an easy self check-in due to our late arrival!
19121965,283772534,2018-06-30,159754183,Vivek,"Her place is the best place to be in. You can find grocery stuff from Loblaws and cup of coffee from Starbucks.
Subway and TTC stop is not that far. 
There is famous Christie Pits Park and many good schools nearby. 
Overall perfect place for a family. 
Andrea was very helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend others to stay here and enjoy. 
House was very neat and tidy and everything was in place. 
We had a great time.
Thanks Andrea for everything. "

Beautiful indoor room and an outdoor room with lots of sunlight. Instructions were clear and simple to follow which is perfect after a long drive.  I  definitely recommend-- I wish this was my room! Not to mention the price was TOTALLY reasonable.

The house was beautiful had everything we needed was especially great for kids (with all the necessary amenities and toys) and you could just tell Christian's make an effort with different special touches. If we are even back in Toronto we will definitely stay here again!

12568616,200207346,2017-10-04,73249131,Cheryl,Christine was a lovely host! She was very responsive to correspondence and her warm welcome and kind accommodation when I arrived in the city was deeply appreciated. She has created a warm bright and inviting space and it was surprisingly much quieter in the evening than I expected it to be given the location. You will hear some traffic but it didn't bother me. I slept so peacefully (a very comfortable bed!) after full days in the city. Within walking distance of cafés restaurants LCBO grocery drugstore TTC and Casa Loma. Very convenient. I would definitely stay again!
22496883,251736159,2018-04-08,82366369,Kevin,Kat's prompt with her responses to questions or issues with the place. The view is very nice in the heart of downtown. Easy communication and easy going.

It has everything we needed from a coffee maker to night stand lamp. Public transport is neat and right at your door. Very recommended for everyone coming to Yonge/Sheppard area in North York. Zipcars available within a block."
7047706,144031297,2017-04-14,117182394,Courtney,Marco had awesome suggestions of things to do instead of the stereotypical touristy things. He was courteous and gave us our space. Would recommend this spot in particular if you are trying to stay out of the hub bub of the city's core.

19906321,347597553,2018-11-11,195628588,Leo,Apartment is cozy warm and clean. We really enjoyed our stay there and highly recommend the place.

5758430,228933485,2018-01-21,12082905,Carey,Great spot good for a quick weekend trip. Loved the little touches such as fresh milk in the fridge some chocolates and nature valley bars.

There were many amenities that are not typical of other airbnb apartments -- like toiletries laundry detergent.  Location was amazing.  Communicating with Ray was a breeze; he responded quickly and was always very helpful and pleasant.  Check-in was also very easy as was check out.  Recommend!

29274511,535921603,2019-09-25,38135913,Karen,A comfy apartment for one or few nights in Toronto. Close to amenities but a little hard to get to in peak hours. Steven provides detailed instructions with photos for check in which makes the process smooth. Recommend.
6953301,70628241,2016-04-19,32002699,Ximena,Amazing hosts really great about responding to my inquiries and went above and beyond to make us feel at home while on vacation. The space was clean and well kept! Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
23752030,255171001,2018-04-19,182805399,Michelle,Quick responses from the host and I couldn't even complain about the price! The home had a very minimalistic vibe to it and although the space was small the decor made up for it and was well thought out. Super impressed and the place was nice and clean. The neighbourhood was safe and it's literally right beside a hospital if anything goes wrong (haha). The place is just big enough for one couple a person traveling alone wouldn't recommend for big families. Other than that Michael was a great host! 5 stars for sure and highly recommend!
14229049,287741969,2018-07-08,30468080,Sophie,"This apartment is in a great location. We stayed here for 3 weeks. There are 2 supermarkets within 5min walk subway station across the street. In a nice neighbourhood away from the high rises of downtown but very hip with lots of good restaurants and cafes.
Tidy apartment with full kitchen. Laundry services available. Javier is an amazing host with great communication and we had no troubles at all during our stay."

13532704,181882227,2017-08-13,40898619,Desiree,Perfect for our group of 6 girls. Walking distance to restaurants and easily accessible from the 401. Bring some extra pillows and blankets for your stay if more than 4 people. There is 1 onsite parking and visitors parking but it was full. Luckily there are multiple spots for pay parking within walking distance.
9608474,157739810,2017-06-04,20616697,Rand,Adrian's place has a great location in the vibrant Leslieville neighborhood. The location was about a 15 min walk from all the restaurants and bars. We had a great stay everything we needed was included in the apartment. Thank you

16252415,322579340,2018-09-13,61616499,Paige,A nice spacious and very clean apartment. However if you’re a light sleeper this may not be the place for you. Since it’s a basement you can hear people walking above which was quite loud at times. Other than that it was a great stay.
20437221,541599867,2019-10-05,244328497,Katie,This location was exactly where I needed for my stay super convenient! Very easy to check in and smooth check in.
29637400,416417485,2019-02-24,128910491,Gabriel,Clear instructions with photos on how to check in/pick up keys/use parkade. Convenient to stay at. Great location. Would be happy to stay here again.
13370172,101286155,2016-09-12,11789004,Carla,"Connie gave us a very warm welcome and left all kinds of thoughtful touches for us which helped make our stay a lovely one. The space is immaculately clean comfortable and charming. Also loved the location. We'll definitely be back!

9559386,99652988,2016-09-05,70371034,Néha,Tarek was really friendly and easy to talk to and overall an amazing host. The apartment was spacious  looked better than the pictures furnished well and a great place to live. The location was perfect as it was right on yonge and bloor and exactly next to the subway station. I would 100 percent recommend anyone this place to stay. It might be a bit over priced but I guess so is Airbnb. Was a pleasure. 
23038776,530204148,2019-09-15,273547906,Shaun,Clean open and close to a trendy neighborhood.
32284210,464407345,2019-06-05,11326188,Fernando,"I stayed at Vedran’s for a week. He is probably the best Airbnb host I’ve never met. 

I had a late check in without any problem the apartment itself was gorgeous and right in downtown with groceries stores right downstairs of the apartment. Everywhere is accessible in a short time. It was also extremely clean the bed was magnificent.


Vedran is very reactive kind and attentive. Not only he always replies immediately but also he creates convivial conversations. I highly recommend his apartment!"
17175506,162175110,2017-06-19,75389909,Hannah,Wonderful clean space within walking distance of many good shops and restaurants. There's a bus/streetcar station nearby too. The bedroom was very comfortable and the kitchen equipped with lots of amenaties. JJ is kind and informative. I would highly recommend this place!
17047357,219907238,2017-12-19,60197778,Anna Emmelie,"Great place and great location! 

It is like a hotel room so the only thing is that you can't make your own food. But sometimes on vacation is great not to anyhow! :) 

We recommend others to stay too! :)"
790887,500772285,2019-08-02,18762178,Nadine,Robert is the hospitable and caring host! He was there to meet us when we arrived and made us feel at home. The room is small but comfortable and the location couldn’t be any better.
28264606,423923669,2019-03-15,64625823,Christine,This is a great location walking distance from the Easton Centre Ripleys Jay’s Stadium. Amazing view!
29415979,458118072,2019-05-25,41579999,Matthew,"Great spot in the heart of an active community.

Simple and stylish pad with lots of light.

The hosts make the stay very accommodating.

Would stay here again."
7227180,285422164,2018-07-03,147203188,Jess,A great apartment in a good area perfect for a short stay. Close to shopping and transport and all sorts of bars. Harrison was easy to communicate with and the place was very homey and nice.
18322798,328556522,2018-09-26,4896799,Heather,I booked Alina’s home for two of my company’s guests and they were comfortable during their stay. The home was clean and the host was very quick and efficient in communicating with us and kindly accommodated our check-in needs. Fast internet for those who need to stay connected. And lots of restaurants and stores in the area!
14633216,420715059,2019-03-07,11633876,Horatiu,"I stayed in Francis's condo for a few nights and enjoyed it: he is nice laid back funny and sociable always happy to help with a tip or advice. The place has separate bathroon which is great; same with your own balcony - did not use it due to cold weather but it's available. Close to everything: restaurants grocery stores and public transportation - 12 minutes to downtown TO. I was also able to park my car underground.
I intend to comeback in the future & I recommend the place to everybody."
20401239,353784318,2018-11-29,51029689,Catherine,Thanks Eric! We had a great stay! The unit was stylish cozy and private. It is in an excellent location. We will definitely book again in the future.
3923307,286547425,2018-07-06,125810116,Glenda,Location location location. Walking distance to restaurants park and beach couldn’t be better. Comfy pillows easy check in and clean place. Thank you ! We had a great time.
35790313,554516080,2019-10-26,9367300,Riley & Alex,Excellent communication and location. Small but fine as we were out and about most of the day!
34204184,500755639,2019-08-02,183725379,Victoria,Communication was a breeze and a beautiful place to explore Toronto.  I would stay again if in the area
23437196,319157865,2018-09-05,55067874,Karen,It’s a absoluty lovely apartment with wonderful roommates. We enjoyed it so much so it was even sadder when we had to leave Toronto. When you are there you hopefully get the opportunity to stay at Marie‘s
10354275,239384122,2018-03-01,146437826,Shengjia,"Susan is very nice. Her house is very clean and very close to the downtown Toronto. 

Also if you have a pet with you I don’t think you can find a better place than Susan’s house."
31801034,548454593,2019-10-17,41092708,Alonso,Joseph is an amazing host and the room is exactly as advertised. The room and the apartment in general is very clean and tidy. The location is unbeatable and you won't find a more attentive responsive and friendly host. He was very helpful when we needed him but at the same time he gave us our space. I would definitely recommend staying with him to anyone who plans on visiting Toronto.
20806050,318850720,2018-09-04,32786960,Danilo,Great host and very good apartment! Would definitely stay there again.
23730789,367788779,2019-01-05,157288084,Janell,It was a great place to stay in and great location! Very clean too! I would definitely stay again. But the only downside we had was we couldn't get connected to the main wifi on our floor. We had connection to another network but it was awful. Other than that this place is central and perfect for a mini vacation in the city.
35638452,517502127,2019-08-25,173841352,Samantha,"If you are attending a concert this place is amazing. 
You are also right next to the union station with access to PATH which allows you to get to the Eaton Center is about 10mins or less. 
There is a ton of food places a stone flick away and a 24hr Subway for late night snacks. 
100% would recommend this place."
1382277,303027238,2018-08-06,178961793,Ashley,We stayed at Cristina's loft for 2 nights over the August long weekend. The location is super convenient and the space cozy & charming! Would highly recommend. 
12919082,496595241,2019-07-27,63013175,Nikki,Brunilda's home is very stylish and very comfortable. We were able to also sit and hang out by the porch area which was very nice on a warm summer day. Will stay there again when we visit next time.
682099,18805317,2014-09-01,1573905,Sabina,"I did not meet my host but she gave me all the informations and help I needed by email. 
Nice house in downtown 15 minutes walking from CN Tower Roger Center.

1510402,285730991,2018-07-04,20748004,Elina,A good value for the  price you pay.  The location is fairly good. There is another guest room right next door.  Overall the place is accurately described.
27005359,326152909,2018-09-21,89619333,Donna,I ditto the other positive reviews! Lizzy is very sweet and accommodating and her condo is secure and quiet and nicely furnished for a comfortable stay. I did need to wear my eye shades at night as the bedroom doesn't get dark. (There are white curtains and the lights glowing from the other condo buildings are weirdly comforting!)
21582618,363405192,2018-12-28,224558883,Alexandra,This apartment is of great value for the proximity it has to the main city. We stayed with five people and everything was practical. There’s a street very close by with great breakfast places to much on something  before going to the main city in Toronto. I recommend this place if you’re looking for something economical for five people and if you want extremely fast texting  response from the host! Great time.
2666562,488007731,2019-07-14,269377003,Lisa,This was my first time with AirBNB and if this is the quality of AirBNB I will never stay in a hotel again. Thank you Paul and Lena
17184710,366496679,2019-01-02,181820904,Clarisse,Le système de check-in et check-out est pratique et simple d'utilisation. Chambre correcte petite mais cela nous suffisait étant donné que nous ne sommes pas restés beaucoup de temps dedans. Salle de bain propre rien à signaler. Pas de parking gratuit mais un parking à 5$ les 12h. Point négatif : le quartier où nous avons pu voir beaucoup de personnes drogués mais aussi une personne qui essayait d'ouvrir toutes les voitures pour voler ce qu'il y avait à l'intérieur.
29793192,351378160,2018-11-22,84030820,Malek,Good location
29134620,505624755,2019-08-09,24087511,Curtis,Was good and very clean
2455129,136930093,2017-03-12,19236466,Shivi,She was a great host and I would definitely stay here again! Everything was clean and organized! 
33216845,439257084,2019-04-18,26623357,Michael,Joseph was an excellent host. His home was exactly as described and pictured! He makes it convenient with the self check in and check out. Would definitely return!
18735592,535510500,2019-09-24,68113568,Thomas,Fantastic place right near downtown with amazing hosts!
21097739,415011249,2019-02-21,143204723,Jill,Great couple of nights staying at Kal's apartment. Great location fabulous view and excellent communication. Everything we needed was there - would recommend!!
13515991,448846462,2019-05-05,51850480,Lindsay,Great hosts great location great accommodations great stay! We would definitely stay here again and appreciated the wonderful hospitality. This location was very central to all of the sites on our list very walkable.
20437827,454577386,2019-05-18,188171466,Timothy,We had a great time at this very nice apartment. It was close to where we needed to be and it had more than we could have needed. The backyard was a bonus too. We would definitely rent this place again.
26474360,551850613,2019-10-20,6611300,Henry,I stayed here for 2 weeks. Behjat's place is super-clean and well-organized. Everything you need is already prepared in the house. Also Behjat and her husband helped me to stay better with cares as hosts as well as friends. Location is also perfect; it is close to markets restaurants and malls. Book here if you don't want to worry about stay. This place is much better than hotel!
9975236,484872018,2019-07-09,156556612,Kimberly,Jason was wonderful there were no issues what so ever. If you like to check in on your own and not having to talk to the hosts this is the place. It’s perfect if you don’t like to talk to people
5990341,537426270,2019-09-28,210916141,洵慧,Very nice place and host.
21378007,252230194,2018-04-09,127374032,Annick,The host canceled this reservation 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
35682640,542592730,2019-10-06,82612499,Jennifer,The place is a prime location and perfect for my boyfriend and I who were staying the weekend for Nuit Blanche. The neighbours were a little rowdy on Saturday night however even though there were signs to keep the noise level down. I found the room to be really cold but Jay was able to increase the heat for me to a tolerable temperature.
23341705,441229901,2019-04-21,159495071,Anna,Overall our stay at Nishi’s was wonderful it was a convenient location to get to many places and the space was just what we needed for a quick get away. The proximity to the highway was not super clear in the listing so that is something to note when booking. I grew up near a major road so the noise didn’t bother me but if you know you are a super light sleeper this place may be too close to the city and the highway for you. The place was clean organized and the checkin process was easily and painless. Also having parking was a major bonus because we were coming from out of town and driving there so it was really nice to have a safe and secure place to leave my car.
35202498,543374918,2019-10-07,96469468,Charles,The apartment was great and our host was very hospitable would recommend.  Thanks!
23039769,330420281,2018-09-30,30199517,Neha,Mmrr's place is at a perfect location very easy to get around with public transportation and walking distance to awesome bars and restaurants. His place is great very clean and has everything you need. Mmrr was also very helpful since the beginning available at all times whenever I had any questions. Totally recommend it.
31644980,536826486,2019-09-27,129600827,Christine,"Die Unterkunft hat eine gute Lage Innenstadt etwa zwischen 20-30 Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen.
Ausstattung war neu und gut.
Benutzung des Innenpools im Nebengebäude via Fernbedienung möglich sehr gepflegt!
Parkplatz im Parkhaus etwa 10 Minuten entfernt auf eigene Kosten.
Vermieter sehr hilfsbereit haben ihn leider nicht persönlich treffen können!"
36733285,566161670,2019-11-18,305967719,Kajal,Great place to live..
24099118,550920332,2019-10-19,6780229,Xin,Speedy reply on problem solving. Amazing. The last second I posted on airb&b about how to get into the building the next second he called in to guide step by step. I think the room atmosphere and the facility were beyond five stars. The location was super convenient. Subway and parking was just right beside the building. The parking cost me almost 40 dollars for over 18 hours. But that’s core downtown Toronto. The price is like that in that area if you want a safe and convenient parking.
21408074,326590569,2018-09-22,49931414,Robert,A very beautiful accomodation in a sweet and calm little street in the heart of Toronto. The host is very friendly and helpful. There is everything you need in the house (washing machine coffee machine a nice balcony). I can totally recommend it.
29637400,493436972,2019-07-22,92355055,Ahsanul Sean,Extremely communicative guest : in other words getting a hold of them or checking in really shouldn't be a challenge it surely wasn't for me =]
13988682,419215703,2019-03-03,67994811,Rodney,Highly recommend great spot!
17093701,485827673,2019-07-11,87549111,Frank,"WOW!!!

It's that simple.

If you want Toronto with another home then this is it.

IT IS SENSATIONAL

Larry is a star and deserves every amazing comment he gets.

The amenities are 100% top drawer which was a fantastic bonus 

Seriously just book it.

Everyone else has said it all.

Larry (and family) we loved it .

Kindest of regards

Frankie"
25056888,510084196,2019-08-15,284865104,Chanika,It's a beautiful home. very clean and had extra towels for us. The neighborhood was a safe and quiet one

13496260,99874361,2016-09-06,435226,Agnes,No common.
6466471,216764151,2017-12-05,121773907,Terence,There is something about Maria's place that can't be described with words. The place is quiet clean thoughtful and walkable to the most attractive areas in downtown TO. It's just a beautiful place with an incredible host. I arrived late at night and she made sure I got the keys and all the necessary information I needed to have access the unit. I will definitely recommend her place if you are in Toronto.
22876294,557636933,2019-11-01,4958864,Jo,this is a gorgeous house in a fantastic location close to shops restaurants and transport. the house is spacious and light everything is brand new and there is everything you could need. there are super comfortable beds an amazing kitchen and bathrooms its gorgeous like a boutique hotel. highly recommended.
5683127,113731447,2016-11-13,95471945,Wenying,It is a very charming house. Very quiet. The room is very big and clean. It closes to downtown. Highly recommended.
13740019,204724526,2017-10-19,99119878,Cathy,Great location for us great hospitality by Bill room clean and bright we will be back.
28239659,509536043,2019-08-14,164499750,Valesca,I stayed here for one night. Laura's place was clean and comfy and the host was kind and helped me find my room and figure out the key. The building had a few other people staying in other rooms so there wasn't necessarily 100% privacy. Overall it was a nice place to stay.
9574298,171474494,2017-07-17,15369139,Rafael,"Excelente localização anfitrião sempre atencioso vista incrível.
Experiência muito agradável."

19532349,424304485,2019-03-16,155189654,Bailey,Great space and amazing location
7999412,314925027,2018-08-27,106181828,David,An amazing location if you want to experience some of Toronto's tourist attraction. My girlfriend and I went here for her birthday and was shocked how close everything is. Shoppers drug Mart wine rack street car etc. The master bedroom was extremely comfortable as well. Any concern that I had Navid followed up in a timely and professional manner. If you are looking to explore the core of this city this location is prime. 
6357166,126666751,2017-01-13,6416372,Jordan,Carla & Dan we're amazing hosts. Very communicative from day 1. They always asked if I needed anything and always responded promptly. Great hosts!

He is so easy to communicate with and makes it so easy to check in and out.
His condo has an ideal layout and the location is perfect. Union Station across the street for metro and trains including airport Express (UP).  Taxi's and Uber are plentiful and so many great restaurants and sites to see within walking distance.
Would recommend this condo wholeheartedly!!!!!!"
17979234,239199995,2018-02-28,170006539,Francis,The place was just as described and very central in downtown. Very close to public transport and the place is modern and clean. Check-in was extremely easy and comfortable. Will recommend to all.
6767129,324685938,2018-09-17,17792185,Monica,Steve was an excellent host and his place was perfect for my short time in Toronto.
15971622,422204092,2019-03-10,119046626,Ashley,The condo was beautiful. Great location. Check in process was a bit slow and confusing.
23862032,454136664,2019-05-17,178089026,Lisa,Super convenient location and check-in.  Sparkling clean and exactly as pictured.  Highly recommended!
34899472,499587136,2019-07-31,170622788,Alexandros,The place is in an amazing location with many bus stops-taxis+ hop on-hop off stop at 5 mins away. It was very clean and beautiful while the owner provided a large variety of amenities. Definitely would recommend it.
36733285,514725913,2019-08-21,283320069,Alisha,Lovely couple. Clean room and bathroom for guest. Allowed to use all facilities around the house. House overall very spacious and beautiful with a good view. Very good value for money! Definitely recommend it.

The building has great amenities including pool and hot tub. The location is very convenient with bus and rail basically right outside. Amy is a great host very responsive friendly and helpful. All for a very reasonable price! Highly recommend.
2062078,181426157,2017-08-12,11241344,Romina,We had a wonderful time exploring Leslieville from Liza's home. Her place is clean bright and well-equipped. She communicated with us regularly and quickly. The house is on a quiet street and boasts a little backyard oasis. Walking distance from great coffee shops restaurants and parks as well as public transit to quickly get downtown or to other parts of the city.
13486027,238395016,2018-02-25,36091297,Hayley,Amazing space. Great communication. Would stay here again!
15484242,333619995,2018-10-07,50247523,Vincent,Liza is a great host. Her place was nice and comfortable. Would recommend!
9884686,151379108,2017-05-12,115214737,Devon,While this was a great location the experience was not good. The apartment was a little worn (chipped paint stained furniture) and wasn't cleaned well (hair on floor food in dishwasher and fridge garbage not removed) for over $500 a night - really not worth it. The bedding was uncomfortable and blankets were too small for the beds. Would have rather stayed in a hotel.
18475177,345626557,2018-11-05,4715722,Jennifer,Basic little room in a great location. Comfy bed. Didn't find it noisy at all. A bit of a climb up the stairs to get to the top floor but well lit and safe.
12891524,165039343,2017-06-30,9625621,Julien,My parents enjoyed their stay in Irina's apartment. Clean well located easy to check in park and great neighborhood.
28244994,408032286,2019-02-03,23066530,Martine,Sebastian and Esther were wonderful hosts. Their place is a very stylish space that’s also very comfortable with everything you need from a hairdryer in the bathroom to spices in the fully stocked kitchen. The location couldn’t be better. Right in the middle of all the great shops and restaurants of queen west and trinity Bellwoods park. We were very happy with our stay.
15743072,480830020,2019-07-03,78693450,Sonja,Very cleanrelaxing well equipped apartment the best location I can imagine !
16109795,136125407,2017-03-08,100074632,Taryn,Amazing place! Carole was a terrific host - her instructions were clear and concise communication was easy and quick and her place was beautiful! We were in Toronto for a quick business trip and I would highly recommend this spot to anyone! High end amenities and everything needed to make the stay feel like home was there! Great views and walking distance to shopping restaurants and all touristy things you would want to hit up! Hope to be back some day!
4057435,19659294,2014-09-15,16533758,Amalie,"I only have positive words for Lina and her place!

I will at any time recommend Linas place!
Thanks for having us. :)  "
6170154,202965051,2017-10-13,36112410,Marion,David's place was perfect for my husband and I. We were traveling from Detroit to Toronto and stayed a few days. The apartment is very close to the metro station so it is easy to get around. David was very responsive and communicated clear and fast. We were very happy to learn that we could store our bags after checkout. Very convenient!
13876855,522907391,2019-09-02,57676,Jeremy,Apartment was great and in an amazing location. You can walk everywhere! You do pay a lot to stay here but the convenience of the location makes it worth it. Apartment itself had everything you need accept we felt an umbrella would have been nice as we did have one rainy day. Also a paint job is needed soon. Everything else was fantastic.

Up ile havaalanindan çok hizli geliyorsunuz ve burasi eve 5-10 dakika yürüme mesafesinde. Maria eve ulaşmamız için gerekli bilgilendirmeyi detayli yaptığı gibi Toronto ile ilgili harita ve diğer bilgileri her seferinde bizimle yeterince paylaştı.  Bize çok güzel kahvaltilar hazirladi ve oldukça misafirperverdi. Gayet güzel bir tatil yaptik ve evde kendimizi evimizde hissettik. Ayrica ev gayet güzel döşenmiş keyifli bir ortami var.
23379027,296844670,2018-07-26,197539116,Jeremy,This was a really nice private suite with one bedroom and another bed in the living area.  The whole apartment got lots of natural light and was super-clean!  We'd stay there again if ever back in Toronto.
22824764,422934179,2019-03-12,244981697,Stacey,True to description. Clean stylish basement apartment with all you need as a young family travelling. Being in the basement of an older house some footsteps could occasionally be heard overhead which is entirely expected. Garage would likely not fit larger vehicles  but our midsize sedan fit easily.
5805424,429968263,2019-03-29,217446064,Susan,Photos well represent this nice place.  Handy to theatre district and has some great restaurants.  What you don't learn is that the first floor of this complex is a bar one that has music or entertainment nightly (believe it ends at 11 p.m. however).  Stairs to 3rd floor in this old building are quite challenging i.e. narrow steep and with no handrail.  Unfortunately the outdoor deck and furnishings were in bad shape at the time we visited.  Inside there's no comfortable chairs or sofa for sitting only two small low quality chairs.
7022166,163822099,2017-06-25,12818115,Lucie,Nathalie and Lucas are very nice friendly and kind people. Their place is easy to find and you get everything you need there. Thank you for making my stay in Toronto so nice:-) 
11431453,215395968,2017-11-29,156800449,Andrew,Good location cozy and convenient. Responsive host.
32586596,434827127,2019-04-08,44868749,Abigail,This 32nd Floor apartment with a beautiful view and balcony is lovely/open and modern plus just a block from City Hall two blocks from the financial district and one from the wonderful Hudson Bay Department Store. I would stay here again just to experience the big city in the spring/summer.
29613234,503819069,2019-08-06,73581681,Sheldon,Decent view of CN tower Nice size Balcony Good Classic Entertainment of PS3.
22410226,246560217,2018-03-25,88772269,Lily,Really great place very spacious. Great location close to nightlife. Alex was a great host would stay here again!
30008108,433083239,2019-04-05,79284323,Milena,The apartment is really stylish and conveniently located. The included parking is also a big plus. Communication with the host was great. We can absolutely recommend staying at this apartment!
38460267,528725502,2019-09-13,180946022,Hiba,This place is great. Close to downtown. 2min walking distance to the subway station. The host is a very responsive and super helpful.  If you feel anything inconvenient they will solve it. At least try his best. I recommend this place.
20957479,572377355,2019-12-02,31370582,Prajit,My second stay at their house but in the bigger room with stunning views of the CN Tower. Everything as expected as nothing short of perfect - from cleanliness to location and from the quality of the mattress to the thoughtful touches in the room. Can’t beat the value for money.
17047357,538148629,2019-09-29,266969353,Susan,Very fast communication. Clean room. Good location. Everything I wanted and needed.
38782035,564286478,2019-11-15,184062752,Brooke,Great place for our family of 5. Everything we needed to be comfortable for our 3 night stay.
6831764,272550215,2018-06-03,162731037,Vinod,Great place to stay.
5917524,309708360,2018-08-18,14452657,Susan,Very clean and spacious garden apartment. Friendly hosts. 
7770469,115305713,2016-11-23,101722284,Edgar,Excellent looking place clean and looks excactly like the photos. The hostess was friendly and helpful. I would stay there again. Thank you!
16779632,216343410,2017-12-03,62985866,Andrew,First AirBnB experience and it was fantastic
25841754,287025168,2018-07-07,25760460,Jeremy,Great flat in super downtown location. Check in easy. Apartment is clean with incredible views.  Thanks. 
3992907,261997101,2018-05-07,113724354,Ashish And Pragna,"This was our second time staying with Janis - she continues to be a very hospitable host and her breakfast muffins are as yummy as they were the last time! We love how central her place is to everything (close to transit great restaurants/coffee shops close by few min walk from High Park). 

We will definitely return to stay here in the future!"
13145719,154656162,2017-05-25,27326361,Paul,Laetitia and Isaac's place is an exceptional value. It is clean modern (new building) and comfortable. For me it is very close to my office (was in town on business). I very much enjoyed meeting Isaac on both check-in and check-out. Laetitia and Issac truly care about their property and the experience of their guests; in my mind that makes them the perfect hosts. I highly recommend this property to any business travellers in particular. The proximity to Toronto's downtown core is exceptional (5 minute walk at most) and the internet connection is solid 150mb/s down and 20mb/s up. So in conclusion I am very pleased to offer a very enthusiastic 5 stars for this property. 
29060586,406964620,2019-01-31,121713351,Jeremy,Great comfortable spot! Bede and Jane are great hosts.
14471456,354052294,2018-11-30,148099578,Guilherme,"The place is amazing. LP is very responsive and did a great job decorating this place. It is cozy comfortable and has everything you may need. 
The only two downsides in my opinion is that the internet wasn't very stable and since it is a basement the internet from the phone also wasn't working very well. Although this is easily fixed by the host I wouldn't recommend this place if you're over 6'2''/190cm. That's my height and there are two places in the house where I could hit my head because of low ceilings (near the bathroom and the main entrance). So if you're taller than me this will be a big problem but if you're my height or smaller you can manage since the place is very good.
The location is awesome too. Very close to markets and you can get to downtown in 20 minutes or so. Not to mention that the bed and the couch are super comfortable! I would definitely recommend this place (considering the height thing I mentioned above obviously)."
13045766,226601234,2018-01-11,31753524,Laurie,Well what a great place I felt like I was in a little cottage in France! Very comfortable spotless very quiet easy check in fantastic hosts the amenities were excellent (not a thing missing) and such a great location for me to get to Queen St or Liberty Village. Even in -35 degrees I could quickly walk for coffee/groceries/ wine etc.. Not a single negative!
19531218,558203716,2019-11-02,45612664,Hem,Dave is super helpful and his place is sparkling clean. He offered breakfast and bought snacks. On the last day he even offered to carry one of my luggage and drop me off at the bus stop - highly recommend. Thanks Dave!
23418598,548441534,2019-10-17,164913874,Rebecca,Tamara is a wonderful host. Super clear instructions for everything and her place is in the perfect location!
24755730,531930267,2019-09-18,241003010,Beatrice Ginevra Maria,Posizione ottima!
21561458,514692229,2019-08-21,49936677,Ariane,The place was awesome and in a very good spot. The communication was also very easy with Chris.
24428976,335588696,2018-10-12,212014471,Christine,"Fantastic value and hospitality well-outfitted kitchen with everything one needs got to do laundry; and not only was Evelyn responsive she also regularly checked in with offers to feed me!

I felt safe my room suited my needs and that of my support dog and I definitely recommend staying here!"
15753679,151219800,2017-05-11,11223306,Julia,"Karla is a great host and very easy and quick to communicate. The apartment was in a great location and very clean. I can definitely recommend it.
"
30352318,543372985,2019-10-07,172392297,Tricia,"Understand up front---even though you've paid for the privlege of using the unit during a specific time---you do not have the option to bring anyone to the unit who is not  part of the rental.  Sounds like they've had some challenges with tenants having loud parties in the past so they've taken away the option to host 1-2 guests or family members during your stay.  I found that to be unclear before booking and very limiting.

Great location clean bed was super comfy.  Be aware the couch is small to accommodate the size for the apt and though it looks pretty in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) very very hard! I fell onto it to snuggle in for a movie and it jarred my spine.  LOL  Really happened!

FYI:  5min walk to Union Station so if you're coming from Pearson Airport use the $12 direct express train ride and avoid an expensive Uber or Lyft.

Walls are pretty dinged up---so it's way past time for a paint job.....but that's just me being observant.

Don't anticipate getting anything that isn't there when you arrive.  I was missing wash cloths and requested almost immediately upon arrival and the request was ignored.  

Longo's grocery store around the corner too.....which was convenient if you don't feel like eating out."
22250232,357150076,2018-12-09,167787947,Alex,The perfect spot the perfect place for any days.
27876543,313626133,2018-08-25,209988532,Laura,The condo was very clean and centrally located with wonderful views. Within walking distance to many attractions and a grocery store. 
13298933,162836786,2017-06-22,91512960,Aaron,Nice place
20789112,512837007,2019-08-18,139944332,Laksh,This is a really great spot for staying downtown. The apartment is at a great location close to everything you could want to access in the city it's a great size for a single traveler or a couple. The interior is decorated nicely and has everything you need. Having access to the roof was nice has a good view of the city and can be appreciated day or night. Chelsi is a great host and lays out everything you need to know. Definitely a great spot to stay downtown if you don't want to rent a pricey condo or a dark dim basement
23981621,416386800,2019-02-24,94266902,Donna Lynn,So close to everything. We were able to hear that fog horn when the leads scored before the tv showed it. We didn't touch the car after it was parked for the weekend.
8226634,346691789,2018-11-09,152010623,Ethan,The place was sparkling clean! Janet is a great host! Great stay!
14395319,100973151,2016-09-11,49091361,Sidney,Really big room the beds are comfortable and the bathroom is great. Willis is friendly and you have a place to park your car. 
35492393,536834601,2019-09-27,112715910,Natacha,Nous sommes arrivées vers 14h le check-in était à 16h mais nous avions demandé si nous pouvions venir plus tôt il avait confirmé que oui. Quand nous sommes arrivées il y avait encore les voyageurs précédents. Nous sommes donc rentrés dans un appart pas du tout propre. Arrivées vers 17h nous avons été accueilli par l'hôte. Il nous a dit que le check-in était à 16h mais il  ne rentre qu'à 16h du travail nous nous demandons quand il aurait pu nettoyer si les voyageurs font déjà leur check-in à 16h ceci n'est pas clair pour nous. Après il n'y avait pas de draps sur le lit et la petite couverture et coussins n'avaient pas une odeur d'air frais. De plus ce qui n'était pas très clair non plus est que l'hôte dort dans le living (pas de chambre à part) . Cela peut être embarrassant et pas très agréable. Sinon la chambre a une vue magnifique sur la tour CN et l'appart se trouve près de tout. Malgré les problèmes que nous avons rencontrés l'hôte est très gentil.
16109795,128413264,2017-01-24,112779174,Daniel,First time using airbnb...and was probably spoiled.  Apt was amazing and communication from Carole couldn't be better. If you get a chance to stay here don't pass it up.  Ohh...when parking...P4 means P4 lol.  The building goes as deep in the ground as it does high in the sky.  The numbers start over on each level.  Just follow Carole's instructions.
24755730,461999400,2019-06-01,11447122,Anika,Super central and quiet location.  Very friendly and generous hosts.  Rooms are very small but including bathroom.  Overall great place to stay for a few days to see the city.  Only the cleanliness left something to be desired.
18770359,263640524,2018-05-12,187859570,Richard,Lovely home tastefully decorated with many thoughtful and considerate touches. Would stay here again when visiting Toronto. Excellent location close to Rosedale Subway station
20458367,503117935,2019-08-05,33331728,Olga,"Todo perfecto. Imposible mejorarlo. Es mejor lugar donde me he alojado incluyendo airbnb otros alquileres y hoteles. Y he viajado mucho. 
Muy completo. TIENE DE TODO. No tiene aire acondicionado pero el clima de Toronto es suave incluso en verano por lo que realmente no es necesario.
Impecable muy limpio y un espacio muy bien organizado donde no falta absolumente de nada. Viajamos con un bebé de 18 meses y Tracy se encargó de dejar cuna juguetes trona cubiertos toallitas...También dejó para nosotros un montón de extras muy de agradecer.
La anfitriona es encantadora la comunicación ha sigo genial. Solo puedo tener buenas palabras.
Recomiendo 100%. No se puede hacer mejor. Gracias de nuevo Tracy.
El barrio residencial donde está ubicada la casa también es muy agradable. Mucha naturaleza alrededor parques y una calle llena de tiendas y restaurantes muy cerca. Además se tarda poco en metro al Downtown."
12943889,78130363,2016-06-05,13027553,Philippe,"Amit is a very nice he insist on taking care of his guests. I really enjoyed his company and the tour he gave us of the neighborhood. He also recommended great restaurants near his place which was delish!!

As for the room what you see is what you get! A closed room and a comfortable bed at a cheap rate. If your looking for a princess place to stay you be better off to chip an the extra dollar. But if like me your more on a budget and is looking for a place to crash next to a metro your have a great guest that communicates very well and is available if you need him.

View is amazing on the 32nd floor."
10309309,189721204,2017-09-02,81514276,Reo,"So nice and kind  host.
there are many amenities so that Its comfortable."
26126082,312481319,2018-08-23,2750967,Lee,Beautiful place
9488909,72954475,2016-05-05,39498855,Shania,It was alright. Although I did not enjoy having to clean their litter box because it was so stinky and then take care of the cat that kept puking everywhere. To myself personally I didn't like the fact that the place seemed like it wasn't even cleaned for my arrival. I know that this place was out of downtown a bit... But there wasn't a whole lot of stores that I could get to by walking which sucked. If you don't want to have to look after someone's pets and have to TTC half an hour into the city... I wouldn't recommend this. Maegan was very nice and I appreciate the stay. But I personally did not fully enjoy my stay and I may just have a different level of cleanliness than her but to me I was displeased. 
3922039,49736336,2015-10-05,12508586,Emily,Great apartment very close to downtown very clean and comfortable. Shaye was a great host and very welcoming recommend it for all
2455129,20349405,2014-09-28,8882092,Tallen,Kate was a great host quick on the communication and very friendly.  Place was nice great location everything you would need.  Looking forward to staying here again next time I'm in Toronto.
28464973,479102031,2019-06-30,143149400,Brij,"Highly recommend this place!!
We had an amazing stay at Suzanne's place. The house is very spacious and clean. The kitchen is well equipped with dishes and all the regular stuff you need making it very comfortable to stay. There is also a garden in the  backyard. My kid just loved playing there. There is a bus stand right outside the house making it very easy to commute around. The neighbourhood is a quite and safe place with few parks around.

The hosts are great very helpful and approachable . I loved her hospitality as she provided us breakfast  the first day after we arrived after a long tiring flight journey. 
Since we were new to the country she helped us provide local information and navigate around the city and even help us in the settling down process. 
We were very happy with the choice we made and to meet such warm and nice people. Thanks a lot Suzanne and Kevin for your warm hospitality."
14731808,411473771,2019-02-12,241363860,Anand,Loved it! Needed some quiet time away for myself and turned out to be the perfect space. Bright clean stylish very comfortable lots of amenities great location. Book it now don't hesitate!

5756051,67168379,2016-03-27,839534,Jessica,My friends and I had such a lovely vacation weekend at Vanessa and Calin's home.  They have created a wonderful centrally located space that was perfect for us.  The house manual and guide to the neighborhood was incredibly helpful and their suggestions were excellent every time. We loved chatting with Vanessa too and didn't want to leave!

Always a quick response from Lindsay and would certainly return and recommend to others."
35682103,492848968,2019-07-21,118691898,Veliz,Great spot & hospitality. Alex went above & beyond during our stay nice and fast responding host. Thanks!
15512181,225776215,2018-01-07,27072434,Tihtena,Ethan communicated really well.  Checking in and out was super easy.  His place is clean and cool. Nextlix was a great bonus. The location is public transportation accessible. We enjoyed our stay.
23041543,269632686,2018-05-27,152615448,Lily,Elvin is very responsive to our messages and is thoughtful in letting us check in early because our flight arrived early in the morning. The room is very clean and spacious and as well as the shared common spaces. The location is amazing since it's right next to Kensington Market and Chinatown so we were able to walk to a ton of restaurants and shops. Will recommend this to anyone who wants to visit Toronto and wants to stay close to food.
17991171,274611441,2018-06-09,35565759,Anne,We had a great time in Kyle's place! 5 min on foot from the subway the studio is great for a couple. Kyle is reactive if you have any problem or request. I recommended 100% the location !
24262711,285727742,2018-07-04,150305789,Tautis,Amazing place and amazing host! Very easy and quick communication. Located right in Toronto so getting around was very easy and had access to many shops food choices and public transport! Would definitely recommend for a stay in Toronto!
314459,539107194,2019-09-30,66838237,Rachita,"I stayed with Julia at 16 Dawson for a month in September 
The experience-
Julia is an amazing woman with a kind heart! I loved chatting with her everyday after work hours (my favourite part of the day!) she made me feel very comfortable and now she is my friend! 
If you are looking for a place to start your Canadian journey or are new in town look no further! Julia has great local tips and is always happy to talk about anything!!! 
Can’t stress enough how great it was spending a month with her :)
The location-
5-7 mins walking from the major subway line
Great neighbourhood 
Extremely safe and welcoming 
All major grocery shops and quite a few eating and drinking places 
The house-
It’s the perfect home for feeling grounded and feeling just at home
Everything you’ll need is available for both a long term and short term stay"
5537555,506516964,2019-08-10,146236170,Grace,Benjamin's place was absolutely lovely everything you need is in there making the house feel more like home. The location was great and close to a lot of stores. Ben himself was a great host quick to reply and help with any inquiries and he was a super friendly guy. I'd love to stay here again when next I'm in Toronto.
15674452,168920433,2017-07-10,128625619,Jermaine,The place was greatlocation was good unit was clean great place to stay.
6039427,536834659,2019-09-27,20149348,Кирилл,Great value for the money. The room was sparkling clean. Location is quite good - city center can be reached in less than an hour by public transport. Communication and check-in with the host without any problems. We even were able to cook simple dishes. The room is in basement which can have certain disadvantages but those were rather minor. All in all I would recommend this place.
36549460,501378067,2019-08-03,7706217,Jennifer,This place was great because we love the city. The balcony was great for people watching and the place was modern nice and clean. Great Decor

15207716,146780843,2017-04-23,22236563,Candace,Quiet location with an easy walk to the subway station.  The room was comfortable and well furnished to meet all your travelling needs.  Erinne was prepared for our visit with public transportation literature and information on the event we were attending (which was so thoughtful).  She was pleasant and very accommodating!  A great place to stay if you are looking for a quiet welcoming place.
20615662,256370320,2018-04-22,43002999,Mc Lin,he's very nice he even run to say goodbye to us personally. thank you again and i really reccomend this if youre just staying overnight for a day.
34593925,454144851,2019-05-17,197911212,Bryan,This was our first AirBnB experience and my wife and I were a little skeptical but Cory's hospitality and personal touches are far beyond what I had ever expected from a host.  He went above and beyond ensuring that everything was perfect.  Check-in was smooth and easy.  The place was certainly immaculate and the views of Toronto from his place are amazing.  The location was in the heart of everything.  Easy to walk to get to everywhere you want to be.  Parking was a breeze and best of all FREE!  The indoor pool and spa were very entertaining for the kids and wife while I enjoyed the gym the most.  Restaurants and bars of all sorts nearby.  Wanna cook something in?  There's a grocery store downstairs.  This was worth every penny!  Thank you Cory!  You're a superhost!
19498271,546486205,2019-10-13,4717754,Charles,The place is quite as represented which is very good. Very spacious pleasant a bit far from downtown but that was clearly expressed in the description so no complaint. So I would certainly recommend it making sure you are aware of its location in relation to downtown.

29137967,546309848,2019-10-13,59204106,Ilya,"Kat's place has great views and is in an amazing location. 
While the room can feel a bit small with all 8 people the host was great at communicating!"
4002741,55259782,2015-11-29,39598082,Harry,Host werr good. On the first night of course I arrived very late and confused. Even though the instructions  were clear but I somehow did not follow  them very well. Elaine was very nice and tried to contact me so as to make me feel welcomed and Greg  also clarified the misunderstanding  I had about the accommodation although I feel it will be nicer if on the room ad they mention that the accommodation is in a small basement with no real wall or door shared by 2 more adult travellers. The house otherwise was very stylish  and kept very clean.
26877569,487905279,2019-07-14,10305514,Jaeny,There are no windows but the pro is you will sleep well in this dark cave! Don’t expect much for breakfast and move on if you have any scent sensitivities as air fresheners are liberally used. The beds are a worn out futon and a couch with a big gap in the middle.  Rosa is lovely though.

Thanks for a great stay. I would highly recommend."
18540206,164254609,2017-06-26,24379722,Loree, This is a very central location quick to get to downtown and right next to Queen West and Kensington market!!

16668215,537410897,2019-09-28,241961026,Karan,A gym is available in the complex but it is in the building next door. Currently there is construction occurring next door too but I didn't find it noisy.
5683702,52191756,2015-10-26,47110828,Mengyu,Excellent room. It's big enough for 2 and the house is clean and quiet. Tammy is very helpful and welcome. We communicated very well. Great experience in Toronto . I strongly recommend this place.

21108565,423906614,2019-03-15,248754680,Jessikah,Bare bones Toronto condo. Great for an in and out stay. Don’t expect extra touches or hosts that go above and beyond but overall helpful and efficient. It is exactly as the photos depict. Clean and in the heart of the city.
20861189,335574399,2018-10-12,9997453,Jeff,"Bron’s home is cozy comfy and very nicely furnished.  Everything is clean and well organized - it was a true oasis of peace for me and my family. 

We were traveling with our 5-month old daughter who immediately felt at home in the space. In order to get in you first need to ascend stairs to the house then descend on a staircase to the basement so because of this we left our stroller in the car. 

This and all other details were communicated to us in a clear & friendly way by Bron. It is clear that she has put a lot of thought and care into doing Airbnb hosting right! 

We strongly recommend staying here. Thanks for your hospitality Bron!"
15235613,326523716,2018-09-22,126538787,Debbie,The space is roomy and very clean. We had everything we could possibly need at this location. Amanda always responds promptly and provides very detailed instructions as to location parking and checking in/out. Thank you for a great experience.
18894131,274214700,2018-06-08,9182253,Immi,"This was the first time I really made a mistake in selecting the place to stay. I have used airbnb a lot and it has often been a great experience and always at least OK. This time I had to move out of the place and it costed me both a lot of money and a lot of trouble in the middle of a conference trip. 

The problem was that Joan had not been honest in replying my questions asked in advance. Before booking I had asked specifically whether the flat was ""quiet no noise""? She let me understand that was the case. However the reality was totally different. The flat is on the 4th floor and giving directly to a very busy and noisy street in downtown. But that was even not the only and real problem: there were major construction works just next to the place starting before 6 am every morning very load with drilling big machines and vehicles horns shouting etc. No way to sleep or to read or to think the whole day. 

Next to that problem it is also good to know that if you stay alone it is a bit scary to enter the flat late at night. The street and the neighbourhood has plenty of alcoholics/homeless people some of whom are aggressive and there is no security whatsoever in the building. You have to enter an empty lobby and then a long corridor with doors some to common lavatories and then another corridor then a service lift and yet your corridor upstairs. With a lot of strange doors and corners again that in the silence of the night and absence of any persons in the (run-down) building which seems to serve mainly for offices. A friend walked me up one night and he found the setting could work well for filming a horror movie. 

Other than that: yes the interior is space and clean. There is absolutely no view however there are concrete bars in front of the windows. But Joan is an attentive professional host who wants to be helpful and friendly."
23905850,328556553,2018-09-26,7554843,Konstantin,"Very reasonable and pleasant accommodation. Fresh repair in the basement. Excellent communication with the Mellory. 
Strongly recommend."

36076435,537450458,2019-09-28,109381129,Natalie,"Jenil’s communication with guests is very good. Unfortunately our stay was less than satisfying with the sleeping arrangements and overall building. 

Sleeping arrangements were not ideal for 4 people as the cheap sofa bed broke two guests slept on the mattress in the end and there was not enough pillows for 4 guests we had to use the couch cushions instead. We also washed the linen as it looked used scrunched up in that container. 

The building well it was pretty clear air bnb was not only frowned upon but actually forbidden in that building as written into the body corporate agreement as the sign stated This made us feel very uncomfortable during our whole stay with other building residents looking at us and making comments.  The parking wasn’t great either in the respects I felt very uncomfortable when organising with concierge. We even got a parking fine. Jenil offered to pay for this. Parking was not guaranteed either I once I booked it.

The location was great we enjoyed easy access to the city and the main attractions."
18785826,281206694,2018-06-24,20219235,Wesley,Kimberly is very friendly and easy to make arrangements with.  Her place was spotless and in a great location.  Very comfortable.

A perfect location for me to walk to my Toronto office.  Incredible value.  

Much better than a sterile hotel room.  It was like coming home."
15190509,518938847,2019-08-27,283481681,Shawn,"It was really clean and comfy. i stayed almost 2 weeks during that period  i had totally no complaining at ALL. Their house is close from airport and starbucks 5min distance by walk coin laundry in 5 min by car. 
I will def come back again to stay or visit them.  Thanks so much having me Tanka and Shibanee"
18681425,176742655,2017-07-31,96751292,Jason,We didn't actually see Roberto during our stay as we both had busy schedules but he was quick to reply via email and made sure that all our needs were met. We had the keys and wifi password waiting for us and clear instructions on how to get in. There were fresh towels waiting in our room and the bed was comfortable with clean sheets. His place is charmingly vintage which comes with certain compromises (a small narrow bathroom) but such was the nature of the era.
26962512,325032785,2018-09-18,194477983,Kundyz,"I was traveling with a friend and we loved Will’s place. It was a very sweet and cozy guesthouse just around the Queen Street - shopping destination in Toronto. It is very close to downtown (about 20mins walking). The room and the house were very clean. We shared the bathroom with one more guest room. 
This spot is meant for travelers who plan to come and sleep mostly :)
William was a fantastic host. Although we did not get to meet him in person he was helpful and responsive to all of our questions."

683292,25224938,2015-01-09,22752513,Linda,What an elegant surprise to welcome me after a long difficult day : a dainty china plate holding delicious home made cookies and my favourite herbal tea. A quiet chat to catch up and my usual cozy bed awaiting me.
25515970,434232831,2019-04-07,78179,Wai-Lin,Terrific; outstanding location a few steps to High Park Raba a 24 hour grocery store & Hannah’s Bakery which is great for brunch and coffee. And a stone’s throw from the TTC. As long-time residents in this neighborhood we were caught in that weird period of having to give up our old place while waiting to take occupancy of our new condo. Tom’s place provided everything we needed a spacious place in which we could catch our breath & relax from packing and moving.

28271554,454589178,2019-05-18,180344235,Sarah,This was a beautiful place to stay for our night in Toronto. For the price which is already amazing to begin with you get the cutest set up with really beautiful decor! Everything is so put together and clean. Bonus it’s so close to everything! We were within a less than 10 minute walk to the Danforth music hall which was amazing for us. Not to mention Sarah’s great hospitality. She was so quick to answer any messages regarding our questions about places to eat or places to go at night. When we got there she was outside gardening and was so kind in person and so easy to converse with! It was clear to us that she was super friendly (and she has the cutest pup in the world Johnathon if that matters to anyone as much as it mattered to me- just made the experience THAT much better). She also connected us with a friend of hers that would help us find somewhere to go out after the concert checked up on us to made sure we had everything we needed and directions to downtown via text and really made us feel like friends instead of just strangers paying to stay in part of her house! Overall it was a really great experience and my best friend and I appreciated the great hospitality :) Thanks Sarah!

26167697,439727710,2019-04-19,120144480,Prabhjot Singh,"This is a very classy place to stay in. Wooden floorings Granite counters new appliances very comfortable bed and furniture this place has it all. (The bed is so comfortable we tracked down the supplier and bought the same mattress :-) ). 
The neighbourhood is exceptionally quiet even though it is very close to public transit and restaurants. There is a 24x7 Metro supermarket & strip mall at a quick walk a Tim Hortons round the corner and a 24 hr bus stop nearby. 
The kitchen comes well equipped with condiments and short term supplies and state of the art Finnish crockery and utensils. Care and attention to detail is what clearly stood out be it the printer/scanner available at the ready or stationery in the drawer or the fully stocked welcome basket or a very stylish heavy duty coat rack at the entrance. 
We ran into no issues at all and would very much recommend staying at this place."

He provided all of the essentials in his apartment along with going above and beyond to get anything we needed before we arrived. He helped explain the city to us and was a wonderful host. I would stay there again if going back.

Check-in was easy and exactly as described. 

I didn't meet Melissa as I was only there a short time but everything was great and as described."
29568357,485863812,2019-07-11,194057029,Abbe,Kam’s place had a great view as pictured. The porch gave us a great place to view the water and that part of the city. There were a few things that could be improved on their was no kitchen trash no coffee maker no doors on second “bedroom” and walls were incredibly dirty marked up and stained. Kam did however allow us a slightly early check in which made it easier for us as we were in for the day and his communication was good.
26127663,490430694,2019-07-18,2366125,Clare,Lovely apartment amazing location with walking distance to many of Toronto’s attractions and sights. Clean and well equipped with greats views from the balcony and the use of the gym and rooftop pool was fab.
28184652,412434705,2019-02-15,167378603,Darren,"Booked David's place with work colleague for week stay and would stay again. 

Two floors and basement with more than enough space for 3 people. Free parking in uncovered driveway. Very quiet. 5 minute drive to grocery and drugstore. Stayed during snowstorm and City Toronto did great job with snow removal. 

No cable but free Netflix. 

This place met the five top reasons why I prefer Airbnb over hotels.
- hassle free check in/ check out (parking line ups front desk payment)
- free parking
- quieter
- kitchen
- more elbow room"

14586418,200491355,2017-10-05,52247428,Sarah,Isa was a lovely host! My stay in Toronto was relaxing with sightseeing. Transport into Downtown is easy with the Subway a short walk and also buses close by. Lovely neighborhood and close to Danforth Street for great food and atmosphere. Isa was helpful with any questions I had about Toronto. Room was excellent!

His apartment was clean comfortable and very conveniently located for exploring the city (only a few steps to numerous restaurants and about 5 minutes from downtown)! 
Would definitely recommend  if staying in Toronto."
24198386,464037552,2019-06-04,24916087,Laura,Amit's spot was great location is top notch condo was comfortable especially the bed! However we had some struggle upon arrival as the fob for the garage didn't work and it took quite a while to check in since there is little to no street parking and we didn't have garage access yet. It wasn't clear what was for guest use and not the fridge and freezer were mostly full but things like vacuum sealed steak didn't seem like they were for us. Used dishes left in the dishwasher as well it does seem like this is a home someone is turning over for guest use not a strict rental. Overall we had a great time exploring and would stay again!
14933789,179501201,2017-08-07,129272380,Ricquel,Self check in was simple the room was clean and Qun provided us with everything we needed. With 4 girls in one room space wasn't an issue we were pretty comfortable. We wished the room had another mirror but the mirror by the entrance made up for that as well as our friendly housemates allowing us to use their bathroom mirror. Location was okay we walked to all of our downtown destinations. Plenty of food options around as well as mini markets. The deck was beautiful and probably my favorite part. The water stayed hot even after the 4th person showered. I would say enjoyed my stay.
27203849,565497635,2019-11-17,306354746,Rájan,Apartment was super clean & smelled great! Ken has excellent communication & the location was perfect & was in walking distance to everything we had planned to do for the weekend. Thanks again!
13174614,276726564,2018-06-14,14165756,Joni,"We have had an unpleasant stay in this appartment. Currently we DO NOT reccomend to stay in this appartment.

The appartment was very very dirty: the bed sheets were not clean multiple hairs on the floor of the whole appartment (incl. bathroom) kitchen (incl. table) were very dirty candle wax on side table next to the bed window frames showed traces of a sticky substance.
It was pretty clear that this appartment has not been cleaned properly for a very long time. 

We advice you to first check if the below broken items are fixed (incl. proper cleaning) before you book this appartment:
Chair (1) water kettle window could not be opened fire pit (1) hairdryer kitchen electrical outlet matress (shows bump in the middle).
No normal set of cutlery no normal glasses only 2 wine glasses.

We have also informed the owner about this during our stay and shared pictures of the above. 

The positive part about this appartment are the overall look and location; nearby supermarket restaurants Toronto bikes. As mentioned in an earlier review the elevators are really slow sometimes it will take you 10 minutes to wait for the elevator and you can not easily use the stairs to go to the ground floor this was also due to the fact that one of three elevators was out of order."
12157556,431701572,2019-04-01,245977341,Jason,We had about a 12 hour layover in Toronto and this place was perfect for a quick rest. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the same situation.
15465463,326536258,2018-09-22,66830094,Jason,This would be our Second stay at Darren’s condo and is worth every dollar  it was again great views  great location to walk to a hockey or baseball game .

12755113,91242397,2016-08-04,3538717,Ian,The room was nice and Rodney was a great host.  Location is very convenient about a 5 min walk from the subway.  Rodney was very good about coordinating check-in and check-out and very easy to reach on the phone.  He has a big dog who can sound a bit intimidating but is super-friendly and completely gentle.  And a little breakfast was included which is rare and super-nice.   Two thumbs up would stay again.

288341,12421966,2014-05-02,6169053,Barbara,Robert's house is indeed a beautiful Victorian home. It has everything you could need in order to have a great stay. Roomy well equipped and just a couple of minutes from the subway into the centre of town. Short walk to many stores. The house is surrounded by green space and there are some very beautiful trail walks close by one of my favourites was Rosedale Ravine where I walked my dog. Robert was quick to respond and sort out a couple of minor issues we had. My husband and I stayed for 3 months whilst relocating from B.C. We very much enjoyed out stay and would definitely recommend the house.

15115175,149921729,2017-05-06,107284199,Suzanne,Will and Jennifer were great to deal with always available by text. The subway is only a 2 min walk and Greek town is about 10min. I really enjoyed my stay but I would have liked to know the low height of the ceiling in advance as my husband was a little dismayed to discover he wouldn't be able to stand up straight.
3992907,196581816,2017-09-23,86399352,Jiyun,Janis's place is really good for family couples or sole travelers as well.  Everything is well organized clean and convenience. Also as a host Janis is a super awsome host. She was always helping us out whenever we needed a help.  Moreover she tried to take care of us by asking we are okay or not during staying. If my family or friends visit me again I will book Janis's place again. To be honest I was super lucky to find her place for my parents and me : (Website hidden by Airbnb) p.s her muffin is super delicious !!! Hopefully she opens a bakery at some point !! :)

It was the perfect place to stay for someone traveling alone or in a very small group. The building was secure and quiet.

Although we didn't see Steve for the majority of our stay the checkin was very easy and it was easy to find. The apartment is clean and the room is spacious. Steve also provides tourist information about the area (maps guides etc.). We rented bikes just down the street which made the brewery district and city center easy to reach.
25014965,287773146,2018-07-08,873125,Chris,Good spot very close to a lot of food! Ali's place was sparkling and we had a lot of privacy! Ali is a superb host!

13845515,354373693,2018-12-01,39142009,Andrea,"The house is very comfortable if you are in Toronto for few days or you are looking for a definitive staying. it's 30 mins from the centre and you need to take 1 bus and 1 metros to go there. 
Be aware that the bathroom is shared with other 3 Airbnb rooms (2 are double). this wasn't written or was misleading in the information.
The kitchen is fine and clean. You have all the stuff to cook."
21683443,401703762,2019-01-15,42506823,Morgan,The place is unassuming and pretty standard but exactly as described. There were good amenities and it was very clean.

5958371,248508046,2018-03-31,2054404,Jo,Marina’s condo is the best Airbnb I’ve rented to date. It has everything you need and is extremely luxurious as it is in Maple Leaf Square. If you are seeking a place that is clean and well presented look no further. It also situated across Union Station. If you are arriving at Pearson Airport and headed to the condo all you have to do is get on to the UP Express from Terminal 1 at the airport to Union Station which costs a fraction of an Uber and is even quicker. It took 25 minutes from airport to union station then a 3-4 minutes walk to the apartment. Check in is easy and so is check out. Follow Marina’s instructions and you will be self sufficient. Downstairs is Longo’s supermarket if you need groceries. There is a washing machine and a dryer if you need to use do laundry. However you will need to head downstairs to purchase laundry detergent. If you are renting this place please keep it clean as I plan on renting it again and I am sure others will rent it again too. It was that good! Thank you Marina!
23691,3464771,2013-02-03,4602020,Mohammad,We had a great night at Yohan and Sarah's place. We really enjoyed the quiet and clean space they offered. They are great hosts and we would definitely  recommend this place.

96336,24583595,2014-12-31,18384708,Alex,We thoroughly enjoyed staying at John's and Brenda's place. It is superbly located near all of Queen Street West's shops cafés and restaurants and the house itself is very modern and well decorated with all the modern conveniences you could hope for.

Wonderful experience definitely recommended to anyone who wants to live in downtown Toronto!

L’emplacement est parfait : proche des commerces et arrêt de bus (en ville en 40min). Le seul bémol est le parking : prévoyez de bouger votre voiture tous les soirs si vous ne souhaitez pas prendre un permis de parking dans la rue."

3290328,30135293,2015-04-18,28576111,Kaitlyn,Anya-Milana was an excellent host. If I needed a mother figure she was one but if I just wanted a friend to talk to she was that too. The location was perfect for what I needed. It was in walking distance of anything needed such as groceries pharmacy and a subway. If I needed to stay in this area again I would not hesitate to call up Anya-Milana and book again.

34176570,528683243,2019-09-13,672590,Milan,Wifi is cheapest possible tier that makes watching YouTube videos even in 480p an exercise in patience. Walls are super thin with no insulation so I could hear people in the next room as if they were in the room with me. That said place was clean and location is excellent.

The view of downtown Toronto from the bedroom and living room is absolutely stunning. Check in was great and Helen is very easy to get ahold of. We had everything and more than we needed for our stay and felt very much at home. Thank you so much Helen would love to stay at your place again in the future!

8320722,282909709,2018-06-28,152098490,Kent,"There are many positives associated with this rental.  The neighborhood has much to recommend it with plenty of great restaurants coffeehouses and shopping within walking distance along with a very large city park just blocks away.  Public transportation to anywhere in the city is just a block away.  Our hosts were very helpful and responsive arranging in advance for a parking permit for our vehicle and quickly answering questions about how to get places on the public transportation system. 

The unit was very clean and updated in recent years with beautiful tile work on the floors and throughout the bathroom.  We did encounter some minor maintenance issues that need some attention: a newer model refrigerator that barely cooled even on its coldest setting and vanity lights over the bathroom sink that failed to operate.  Without them the bathroom lacked enough light to safely shave and it would be an issue for someone applying make-up etc.  Also while clean the bed linens were worn and the pillows were completely flat and offered little support.

There are some issues unique to this property that could be deal-breakers for some.  The bedroom lacks a door so if couples rise at different times as we do it is difficult to avoid disturbing the later sleeper.  Also the low ceiling height (and even lower ceiling where a support beam protrudes into the living space) will be an issue for anyone over 5’8” tall.  We bumped our heads a couple times during our stay.  The utility room for the entire townhouse is located in the basement unit.  We were very aware of the central A/C when it ran.  Also there is no separate thermostat/temperature control for the basement.  We closed all the vents and were still cold as our hosts ran the A/C regularly throughout our stay even when outside temperatures were in the 60’s F.  Living in a basement unit you are definitely aware of footsteps and activity from the upper floors so light sleepers or those who sleep off-hours may find this a challenge."
15512850,442839780,2019-04-24,86229593,경화,It was really clean and cozy place to stay. Bedrooms are comfortable and amenities are served well. But we could not lock the washroom's door and a little bit far from the downtown.
4030756,174647016,2017-07-26,117684049,Angelina,Host was very interactive and helpful when it came to our needs. He was able to offer a last minute service very efficiently. Glad to say Ilya was a perfect host for our stay.
18877956,275211708,2018-06-10,36198393,Jeremy,"Place is as described.  Perfect for groups and others wanting to be in the heart of the action.  Meredith and Gresham were outstanding hosts and were very responsive the whole trip.   The roof top patio is amazing during the day and the early eveng hours.  The place is walking distance to pretty much anything you want in Toronto.  streets can be a loud on the weekend especially with the windows open and one bathroom could cause issues if you have more that 6 people.  other than that this place provided exactly what we wanted for a bachleor party.   we had a great stay.



thanks!"
34395969,489868585,2019-07-17,141122494,Hannah,"Saghar's condo is an amazing place that I would 100% recommend to anyone looking to stay in the heart of downtown Toronto. 

Communication: Saghar was an attentive host that kept in touch before our stay and made sure we had everything we needed when we arrived. 

The accommodation: The condo is clean smart and intuitive. The bed was dead comfy and the views of the city from both the main living area and bedroom were pretty spectacular! Significantly for such a vibrant part of the city we were not disturbed by unwanted noise during our stay. 

Location: We only had four days in Toronto before moving on to Niagra on the Lake so location was very important to us. Saghar's condo was close to the major sights transport eateries and bars. 

There are no negative comments for this very special place!"

24777029,284504457,2018-07-01,105423380,Emma,Stayed in Grace's place for a month. Loved it. Had a job on Toronto Island so the location was quite far out but otherwise it was perfect. Grace was the perfect host checking up and ensuring I had everything I needed. The house is lovely and I couldn't have asked for a better stay or a more welcoming home.
1510402,10488008,2014-02-21,11845896,Jiří,I've stayed at Amy and Graeme for just a couple of nights but it felt like staying home. They are nice kind and open people and it was a pleasure to meet them. Also the location's perfect. Interesting yet peaceful neighbourhood very close to subway and if you favour a walk you can go all the way downtown by foot.
33578570,461446855,2019-05-31,253054782,Alexis,Lovely accommodations right in the heart of Queen W. Shaunna is great to deal with and the space is beautiful.

She was also very helpful and quick to respond. 
The condo is in a great location and the TTC stops were very close and easily accessible for places out of walking distance. 
We would certainly stay here again!"
11472952,214723876,2017-11-26,48240134,Jonathan,Arturo's place was clean beautiful and spacious. It was perfectly located from public transportation as well as restaurants and bars.

3476587,291318119,2018-07-15,191274058,Michel,A stylish spacious clean and comfortable loft from which to explore TO.  Right around the corner from the King streetcar 10 minutes from  Yonge and Dundas 15 minutes the  other direction to the  Distillery District. Friendly and very responsive host highly recommended!

7126527,507506257,2019-08-11,74388798,Jessica,This was a nice place and very clean. We really appreciated Patrick printing a parking pass for us in advance so we didn’t have to figure out how to do that ourselves while travelling.
19970549,433026119,2019-04-05,251794881,Alice,Great place to stay. I enjoyed it very much. Rooms kitchen bathrooms are very clean. I would strongly recommend this place for new visitors. Thanks a lot to the host for great hospitality. Appreciated.
1856109,25306817,2015-01-12,19948761,Iain,I had such a great stay here. Indrit and his whole family were fantastic hosts. The apartment was clean well equipped and really near the subway station making it easy to get downtown. I had a longer stay than they usually allowed because I liked it so much I didn't want to leave! I will definitely return and have no problems recommending this lovely place to others. Also the fact that Indrit's Mum is such a kind and generous woman helps this rate as one of the best rentals I've had.

3159794,272592907,2018-06-03,6727096,Cory,Great location close to every amenity. Amazingly comfortable bed! I never got to meet Abhi as he was away but the check in and check out was arranged through his friend and was super easy. He installed an air conditioner for my stay which was a thoughtful touch as the city was unusually hot that weekend. Thanks Abhi!
26878175,340317468,2018-10-23,28933279,Julian,Extremely well situated very clean and comfy all amenities provided (inc shower gel/shampoo/conditioner tea and coffee bottled water Netflix on TV) great view.

7330089,71715947,2016-04-27,9714876,Brenton,Sandra was a great host and the apartment was beautiful!  The apartment looks just as it does in the pictures and everything has been renovated to a very high standard. The area is great with so many new and exciting restaurants and bars halfway between downtown and beaches suburbs! Any time I messaged Sandra she would reply very quickly answering any questions I asked check in was also very easy and simple I can't recommend this place more highly. It was a great place to call home for 5 nights.
30718787,430000098,2019-03-29,87302776,Derek,Great place! Small but well equipped for one or two people. Easy check-in/out. In a nice area! Streetcar comes right out front  if you're heading dowtown.
17777800,487976217,2019-07-14,17817593,Brian,"The rental space is an excellent location. You are right downtown and within walking distance or a quick Uber to the many diverse and vibrant neighborhoods of Toronto. 

Likewise the space is perfect. There is a living room and balcony that is perfect for socializing. There is also a nice gym and the pull out coach is very comfortable. There was plenty of space for the two of us. Lastly Shawn is a great host and answered all of our questions quickly. I would strongly recommend staying here."
18812517,200772244,2017-10-06,137332026,Lorna,A lovely clean apartment in an excellent location. The check in process was simple and efficient. Communication with Shawn was prompt and he was very helpful (he recommended a nearby hotel where we could leave our bags on our departure day). Would definitely recommend.

12973673,315748615,2018-08-29,116251943,Lydia,Everything was great Logan and his roommate are super nice!
30037646,366368523,2019-01-02,23251310,Bonnie,Ora’s place was great! She met us for check in and check out and helped us with any questions that we had. The place is very nicely lit for a basement apartment and the indoor fireplace heater was a nice touch. Just to note the washing machine/dryer can only be used on certain days and the oven is not in use.
8461590,159709492,2017-06-11,112529563,Oscar,Nice house central location short drives to anywhere you wanted to go or see large driveway accommodated 5 cars since parking is issue during day. Definitely would stay there again 
32820909,469913552,2019-06-15,259209643,Joyann,Nancy is accommodating and her response time is really fast.  The place was exactly as described.  Check in was easy.  The location was great for our purpose.  Within 15 minutes walk of train station supermarket restaurants banks and shopping area on Danforth.
1631386,506374316,2019-08-10,282247792,Raj,I'd highly recommend this place. One of the best locations in Toronto ( Right off downtown so not extremely bustling yet perfectly connected through bus and subway routes ). The room is speckless bathroom and shower big enough and no complaints whatsoever in terms of ventilation and sunlight in the house. Ideal to stay for a few days and both Greame and Amy have been nice to talk to in general or in case of doubts/suggestions.
18491349,330568396,2018-09-30,78638626,Harrison,Great value very convenient location to campus/downtown/subway public spaces not air conditioned quiet. Overall great stay!
23090345,297909423,2018-07-28,34110310,Tina,Nazli is promptly responsed. The location is awesome close to north York TTC station.
1792909,318213419,2018-09-03,7429934,Nelson,Joe is a wonderful host.  Emails were answered very quickly and everything in the ad is what it really was.  Joe met us to give us the keys and gave us a small tour.  The place is very clean and was perfect for our small party.  It was centrally located in downtown Toronto and footsteps away from the Metro Convention Center Rogers Centre and CN Tower.  Next door is a nice breakfast place named Siempre.  Down a few steps and you have a Tim Hortons.  Across the street is a 24 hr store if you have the munchies in the middle of the night.  Overall this was a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to stay in a central location.
20816907,498295068,2019-07-29,218943353,Kostiantyn,Spent my first month in Canada at Dan’s place. Very comfy and quiet all necessary amenities quick access to TTC. Would stay again.

25158320,420084785,2019-03-05,241899575,Pierre,Great location as it is conveniently located off the 401 close to shopping and restaurants.  Atul is very helpful and responds within 15 minutes of contact.  Great for larger groups as it sleeps six people and having breakfast included is a nice touch.

Their apt. is truly lovely nicely furnished/decorated and very conveniently located really close to Wellesley subway station -about 5 minutes walk-.

I would love to stay with them again!!"

1226374,9426111,2013-12-28,9889449,Kuntal,"We had a great time at Tricia's place. We stayed there for a month. She was very helpful from beginning to the end. She was very quick in her responses when we had questions. The unit was very clean and spotless and we did not had to worry about our 9 month old crawling around. 

Unit was well furnished and we had everything we needed. The view was fantastic as seen in the unit (Website hidden by Airbnb) Tower Gardiner and some part of the lake kept us entertained while we were there. Netflix was a great plus to have. Building has great amenities including hot tub at the 27th floor looking over the lake. Unit is located very near to Sobeys which was a bonus.

Great place great host would love to return again and definitely recommend the place.

34114458,453673056,2019-05-16,193656240,Megan,Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The location is undersold in the ad — we were floored upon arrival to realize that we would be staying right in the heart of downtown (and in such a beautiful and iconic area of Church street to boot!) for the reasonable price we paid. We did not get a chance to try the restaurant downstairs as we had a very busy trip but Fei informed us that brunch is complimentary to guests and that all other meals are 50% off — incredible as the room itself is already such a steal! We stayed in a room with private bath which I would recommend as I can’t imagine the washroom sharing to be super convenient. Besides our little ensuite bath was adorable (very clean with gorgeous exposed brick walls)! Ample storage space and coffee/small appliances in the room. The hosts could not have been more lovely and personable during check-in. Look no further this sweet little boutique hotel is an absolute gem!
25266426,483645326,2019-07-07,174254675,Parisack,Séjour inoubliable merci beaucoup à Sal et Moe dont leur réactivité et leur hospitalité est incroyable. Je recommande à yeux fermé et je reviendrais séjourner avec plaisir. L’appartement et les équipements sont juste à coupé de souffle. La piscine est un gros plus.
18889880,318419482,2018-09-03,50721753,Carl,Raj's place was extremely clean and neat when we checked in. The location is in the middle of the entertainment district which is fantastic - easy access and walking distance to many venues and public transportation. Great value and very helpful host. We will stay again next time we return to Toronto!
15263936,413589150,2019-02-17,151796048,Sergio,Um ótimo lugar bem no coração de Toronto próximo aos melhores pontos turísticos. Os melhores anfitriões que conheci na vida que disponibilizaram sua casa com total disponibilidade e apoio. Muito obrigado Santiago e Cristina.

13182530,277077428,2018-06-15,93213806,Jesse,"Great place! Christine and Timmy are simply wonderful people. Both were very friendly and inviting had great tips about what to see and do and talked about life quite easily. Their apartment is such a good value too. Clean simple and easy to get to. It really is just a short drive to a metro stop and theres plenty to do around town.

If you're visiting the Toronto area this is the best bang for your buck and hey who doesn't want to stay with awesome people? Thanks Christine and Timmy for everything!"
16506363,265848770,2018-05-18,189544752,Imandeep,Good one
14286759,522653529,2019-09-02,4968186,Claudia,Angela's place was one of the best experiences we've ever had in Airbnb. We couldn't have felt more welcome. Due to so many positive comments from other guests our expectations were quite high and yet we were positively surprised. We loved the neighborhood full of hype shops and restaurants and Angela gave us precious tips such as Trinity Belwoods Park Type and Swipe bookstores; all in walking distance. In my last day I had a problem with my bus ticket and Angela Michael and Zoe were super kind and supportive. I strongly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again.
13825593,454140458,2019-05-17,259964814,Josh,Excellent space for an excellent price. Very private and cozy. A home away from home.

13435785,533373670,2019-09-21,145066124,Jarrod,Small but works well for a night. Not too far from the Budweiser Stage for concerts.

24054781,319922141,2018-09-07,210764064,Sean,"You could ask for a better location with apartment being steps from Bloor St. W. One of my lontime favourite places in the city Three Speed is very nearby.

The apartment is thoughtfully decorated and furnished — almost felt like a cottage in the city. Very bright and quiet with a really comfortable bed; slept so well. Kitchen was great to cook in open and airy with a ceiling fan to keep space cool (I was there in summer). 

The bathroom was also roomy with great shower fixture.

I’ve lived off and on in Toronto for a long time back in towm for most of this summer and found myself wishing this was my apartment!"

3859494,105044503,2016-09-30,83990280,Laura,Shannon and Gregory were very welcoming.  They provided clear instructions and were there to greet me when I arrived.  I loved the studio apartment - it was clean and bright.  I was able to park my car at the front.  They were having the sidewalk repaved  but they provided me with a good alternative.  A very enjoyable experience!
14122952,155199078,2017-05-27,90644335,Carly,Polite host and makes sure your comfortable with everything before leaving you. Just wish the bed was more comfortable it was quite hard. Other than that it was what the ad describes 
6092042,63439093,2016-02-22,24541273,Elan,The condo is as described. We had a couple issues that happened and the property manager couldn't handle them. Afterward Rajnee worked out a solution to the problem so I am happy with the host and how she handled everything. I would recommend staying here.

20845815,321045416,2018-09-09,100138850,Josh,Great location but tons of construction going on that I wish I’d known about. Thankfully I didn’t need to stay in the apartment all day because from about 9am onwards there was loud incessant drilling noise.
30154789,564323138,2019-11-15,1930866,Drea,The stay was lovely. Quieter than expected. Banksy artwork I found across the street in the mall like area which was a great find. The pool was great and the sauna. I didn’t use the gym. Bed was super comfy. Small place but perfect in everyway. I would def. stay again.
6312390,49892493,2015-10-07,7827072,Anne,Judy was an exceptional host. She gave us a very warm welcome.  Her apartment is exactly as pictured.  If you are fortunate enough to stay here you will not be disappointed.  Very comfortable beds.  The  whole apartment is very tasteful and  well equipped.  The neighbourhood is great.  A very ecclectic mix of shops and good casual restaurants.  Close to good public transit.  I would be happy to stay here again.  There truly was nothing negative about our stay.  Highly recommend.

17777800,270074179,2018-05-28,25069550,James,Shawn's place is ideally located in downtown giving you easy walking or short Uber access to shopping restaurants and nightlife.  You are about a 15-min walk to Union Station or to Chinatown.  The place is a corner unit and the whole place can be naturally lit during most of the day of course one has to use the blinds during the late afternoon hours to reduce the sunset rays.  Terrace was a nice touch and there was a constant wind.  The two fan units were useful to keep the air circulating around the unit.  Thank you for providing body wash/shampoo/conditioners.  Bed was very comfortable the sliding doors can offer privacy if needed.  There were at times 1-2 elevators operating over the weekend but everyone was pretty patient.  Overall it's a great place to stay in.  Thanks!
20802530,226790377,2018-01-12,147132400,Rolando,Walid is being one of the coolest owner I met! His place is even nicer than the pictures. 100% recommended. Walid a été très gentil depuis le début! Il m'a attendais avec un gros bol de fruit et chocolats... la place est même plus belle que dans les photos... tout est très propre et neuf... il ne manque de rien!

4310793,31179239,2015-05-03,1313069,Dylan Drolkar (Ying),Don't need to say much about how convenient the location is and how comfortable the place is. Just want to say Tam is the best host I've ever met. One night I came back late tired and hungry Tam warmly invited me to join his dinner a gesture that really touched people's heart. On the early morning before I left he made effort to get up in order to say goodbye like an old friend. Tam when you have chance to visit Vancouver don't forget contacting me. :)) 
12367262,101273537,2016-09-12,85016063,Sunil,Great apartment in a very convenient location. Bus and subway station are a short walk away from there it is only a 10 minute ride to downtown. No need to travel too far into the city for things to do as there are a number of great food and bar options within walking distance of the apartment. Located in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. David was a great host very kind and quick to respond to any questions we had. He made us feel very welcome during our stay. I highly recommend this apartment.

13715751,204726539,2017-10-19,139850597,Kate,The location here was great! Walking distance to Union Station ACC and Rogers.  The size of the unit is good for a couple or two people. Entry description was very helpful. The building seemed  safe and we felt comfortable using the pool. Could use extra towels and a new mattress on the pull out couch. Otherwise a good choice that I will recommend to others and use again myself.

Jc was a great host who responded quickly and brought us what we needed throughout the week (like an extra blanket). The only issues we had was that the walls are super thin so you’re able to hear everything that’s happening in the next suite over. Overall a great place!

15602349,274199715,2018-06-08,63078033,Caroline,Très bonne localisation. L’appartement est dans une rue pavillonnaire calme et très agréable mais perpendiculaire à une rue commerçante (supermarchés bars restaurants salons d’esthétique...). Le métro est à deux pas. Il est également à quelques minutes à pieds de High Park. L’appartement est exactement comme sur les photos: rénové à neuf et propre. Petits bémols: il fait froid dans l’appartement lorsque l’hôte met en marche la climatisation dans sa maison (j’ai dormi en polaire alors qu’il faisait 25 degrés dehors) et le canapé-lit est correct pour 1 personne mais pas très confortable pour 2. Malgré tout je recommande pour les petits/moyens séjours.
24104340,513459840,2019-08-19,179905109,Sebastian,Appartement central parfaitement situé au downtown. Conforme aux photos. Carla nous a toujours répondu de façon réactive.

5857536,76709661,2016-05-29,33049803,Tyler,Nina and Nay were great hosts for my stay in Toronto. They were accommodating to my check-in time since I arrived earlier than their usual time. They were both helpful in making sure I found my way correctly on the subway which was great because the stop was no more than 100 ft from their home. I would definitely stay at their home again in the future. 
1604069,510775244,2019-08-16,80285126,Katja,"We had a really good  sadly too short stay at Alan's and Lucille's place. A gorgeous place with a great view and a lovely garden with so much flowers.

The location was perfect so much shopping and wonderful restaurants and felt extremely safe. Sorelle Bakery on the floor level is a must!

Bedrooms are nice and very comfortable beds. 2 washrooms on ground floor and 1 on basement. Outside the property is not modern and chic but inside is very comfortable and clean. 
Sinna was leaving us bottles of water ( which it was great ) milk in fridge + bread +orange juice +some fruits +pasta +rice+tea +coffe+sugar+salt +oil.........
All of these comes very handy when you just arrive to the new place. 
Location was pretty good ( walking distance to Tim Hortonpizza and more )
We had a great stay thanks. :-))"

14935968,229615956,2018-01-24,156681335,Nimrata,I stayed at Steve and Victoria’s coach house for 6 nights. Communication prior to my visit was excellent and I received a really warm welcome from Victoria on arrival. The coach house itself is beautifully appointed and decorated absolutely spotless with excellent amenities. I loved the little unexpected extras provided by the hosts (wine beer and nibbles). Easy walking distance to the awesome bars and restaurants in the area. All in all an incredible stay really grateful to Steve and Victoria for making it so special!

Every morning I could see squirrels and chipmunks running by the backyard. The living room is a nice place to make new friends and chill. It was perfect more than I was expecting.

Alison was not here but there was one girl who is also living in the house. She was very funny and friendly. She gave us some useful tips to do in Toronto.

If u want to cook then u can use the kitchen.

Staying at Lesley and George's was a total revelation! The apartment was absolutely incredible even better than what was described! The view is amazing the location is spectacular and Lesley George and Bonnie (Lesley's mom who checked us in) were second to none in terms of their friendliness communication and making us feel welcome.  We would not hesitate to stay here again and would give it more than 5 stars if we could!
3979252,19178039,2014-09-07,4240216,Nick,"Laura was a great host during our weekend trip to the Toronto Film Festival. Her pool house was a unique and luxurious experience in a phenomenal location within Toronto in the Yorkville neighborhood. We were welcomed with drinks upon our arrival Laura answered all of our questions about the city and were able to park our vehicle the whole week without worry. This is a great option for anyone looking for a private romantic option looking to explore an incredible city!

14594697,422185302,2019-03-10,138252406,Chelsea,The location was great it was perfect walking distance to all the popular tourist destinations. We were pretty upset about the false advertisement of the amenties (gym sauna pool). They told us that guests aren’t allowed to use them so I am not sure why it was even on the listing. The amenties were a big part as to why we decided this listing. We also wish they have added how small the room actually is. There is no room at all for your luggage so you have to keep going in and out of the room to the living room to get your things. This listing would be perfect for a solo traveler but anything more it is definitely too small. The pillows were extremely hard they aren’t your typical pillows so bring your own fluffy soft one. Overall it is at a good location.
8050528,74707006,2016-05-16,13874266,Francois,Great location in a nice neighborhood the apartment was convenient to everything. Wonderful view from the large balcony was very nice to come home to.

In short I would recommend a good landlord and a perfect apartment to others.
2832297,59420186,2016-01-10,23653020,Alioune,"The whole building is very modern secure with friendly neighbours. After one night I was calling this place ""home"" it might give you an idea of how the host makes you feel... :)
So far the best place on airbnb where I have been. Obviously you don't have to look somewhere else book it now!"

14722831,236220491,2018-02-18,74575154,Gabriel,Georges’ place is nestled in the heart of Toronto’s posh Yorkville neighborhood. The apartment is spacious and aesthetically pleasing not to mention impeccably clean. Great shopping food and galleries steps away. Georges was communicative friendly and accommodating throughout.

The house was in a perfect location - close to downtown and activities yet in a nice quiet neighbourhood. Paul was always quick to respond to any questions we had prior and during our stay. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him as a host to anyone else looking for a beautiful home in Toronto. Thank you for making this such a wonderful experience! 
3229169,34220281,2015-06-06,18022584,Jeremy,My stay was very comfortable and as advertised on the listing.   I would stay again and recommend it to others looking to stay around that area of Toronto.  The only thing I would mention is of you are over 6ft tall you will probably find you can't stand up straight in the bedroom.   
29411935,497390546,2019-07-28,197562115,Gema,The apartment was very clean and we had a comfortable stay. It was in a very good area of the city easy to get to downtown and me and my sister felt very safe walking around the neighbourhood even at night. It was a bit cold in the apartment but there was some heaters available. The only reason I wouldn’t come back is that you can hear everything from the upstairs unit and I had a hard time sleeping since I am a light sleeper and even the lightest footsteps would wake me up. Other than that I would recommend staying at Raymond’s place.
12913357,133066990,2017-02-20,12069445,Joanne,Great location good building easy to communicate with host very responsive view is fantastic bed really comfortable. Would stay again and highly recommend.

6452493,212976179,2017-11-19,23613816,Lacey,"Margarida's place is as seen in pictures with being very clean and nicely organized. It was convenient to use the subway and the bus #63 as well. We only met at check out due to my tight schedule... But she was great with quick responses. Only thing is that at night time you can hear the boiler running quite loud. If you are sensitive then you would be able to notice it but I had no issues as I'm a deep sleeper. 
Thanks for my hosting us and would like to be back for my next visit as well :)"

The place was very clean and the backyard is a cozy spot. Crystal is a great host and she responds promptly. There were a couple of issues with the internet and washing machine but Crystal took care of it quickly. I definitely recommend her place if you are visiting Toronto. :-)

It was last minute but he accepted us. Although we didn’t get the opportunity to meet him we were greeted by his lovely wife; she was so kind and warm to us we felt so safe.
Osmund’s place is very clean. Would definitely recommended it to ANYONE looking for a friendly safe and affordable atmosphere."
13256555,155962752,2017-05-29,68053866,Carlos,"It was calm and reliable staying in Yas's apartment. She is quite and helpfull person. The apartment was clean and tidy... She allow us to prepare food and use her stuffs to do it but don't forget to wash the dishes as soon as you finish your meal to keep the kitchen clean.
The location is very good near of a lot of restaurants supermarkets and transportation. The cat ( Shadow) is so curious and needy but he is so cute lovely and clean. Yas use to go to bed early because she wake up early to work so it's not appropriate to do noisy after 10PM. She really respect our privacy and the room is entirely mine when I was there. There is an firefighter station in the other side of street so sometimes there are some sirens playing because of that wich  was not a problem for me because I used to sleep all night long. Yas hope you become a professional biker because it's healthy for your body and mind... Take care!!!"

36610053,568610019,2019-11-24,221435341,Jasmine,"Dishes in the cabinet were not clean there was food still stuck to them. Not sure if this is an oversight? Amenities included pool. When I messaged the host asking why the pool was not open I was told that the pool is closed for airbnb guests... so my question is... why is it included as an amenity if we cannot use it? False advertisement. There was a whole different protocol for signing in as an airbnb (Email hidden by Airbnb) pletely different from the instructions provided by the host - took us by surprise.

Only worth it because of the amazing view of Downtown CN Tower and access to local fun!"

818228,11398713,2014-04-01,11952464,Tiago,"First time in Airbnb and loved it! Both Amy and Graeme were very welcoming. They will make you feel at home the moment you walk in. The room was lovely and very cozy. Although I spent most of my trip outdoors I bumped into Amy a couple of times to ask her either about directions or have a quick chat with her. Even though I seemed to always find her busy with work she would stop doing it and turn her attention to me - sorry Amy! I found her an extremely nice and kind host! Being interested in nutrition - and Amy being a chef herself - I was very glad to learn a couple of things from her too. Their daughter is also adorable :)
To sum it up next time I'm back in Toronto I know where I'm staying already!"
23981621,452609775,2019-05-13,244907535,Deanna,Really fantastic location great pool and gym in the building as well as a grocery and liquor store. No AC but the balcony is lovely and elevators can take some time during busy hours of the day. The unit has three full sized comfortable beds with their own space. Would definitely book again!

28219043,334900856,2018-10-10,63949260,Noah,Honestly if you’re planning to stay in Toronto as a seasoned frequent flyer or a total first timer this is the best place to stay. AMPLE room for multiple guests GREAT location if you plan to experience everything Toronto has to offer whether that’s the Aquarium CN Tower or just finding amazing places to shop and eat. Great stay and great price. My only tiny critique; I wish the beds were a little less firm but don’t let that sway your choice. Everything else makes up for it. You won’t regret it!
26819389,422949075,2019-03-12,247099806,Paul,"Beautiful view and place. I highly recommend Aaira to any Toronto travellers looking for a relaxing and incredible stay!

3942993,274181518,2018-06-08,121391692,Richard,We had a great couple of days in Toronto. Joseph's apartment is really central and the flat is stylishly done with a super comfortable bed. You just have to accept the fact that you are over a bar and it might get a bit noisy at times. Other than that a perfect base for a Toronto break Joseph was really prompt in dealing with us.

6196536,136574331,2017-03-11,7316019,Dorothea,I stayed with Catherine at the beginning of a working holiday in Canada and I could not have chosen better. I liked the cozy room and atmosphere of Catherine's place.  But even more important that Catherine was the perfect host. She had plenty of good advice on where to go and how to get around which was priceless. Catherine is easy going and we easily found things to talk and laugh about. Thank you!

4117546,545483245,2019-10-12,12701911,Karen Thule,"We booked through Khalid for 5 days in Toronto. The day before arrival he notified us that we were not able to check in for the first night and so we had to book a hotel for that. 

The day after we tried to get in touch with Khalid multiple times regarding check in only to find out that he was not able to accommodate at all. This was around afternoon. The entire situation was very stressful especially because he was really hard to reach at all time. We would not recommend Khalid."

9664134,327213509,2018-09-23,973764,Georgina,This is a great place to stay. Maxim is really friendly and communication was always easy. There was a folder with tips for local places to eat/drink etc which was really helpful. The apartment itself is a lovely space - I was there alone for a few nights but it would be a perfect place for a couple for a much longer holiday. It's light and airy. The bed is comfortable the bathroom has everything you need (and more). When I arrived I found filtered water and ground coffee waiting in the fridge which was a very welcome sight! The neighbourhood is nice - the street itself is quiet but it's easy to get to livelier parts of the city and there are convenience stores and a 7-Eleven nearby. I walked up from Union station which took about 40 minutes but if you're able to do that it's a good way to familiarise yourself with Toronto. It's also not far to walk to Kensington Market which was brilliant. Thanks Max!

15770518,241076906,2018-03-07,5166033,Michele,This location with easy access to the Toronto Convention Center is perfect for trade show attendees. We appreciated being able to cross the street walk from the North Building to the South Building link up with the PATH and head out to the airport train in minutes--or miles of underground restaurants and shops off the PATH. Super cool when it's cold and the wind is blowing. Staying here for a baseball game would also be awesome! Sarim was great to communicate with. And the place is super clean and fresh. No cable connection for local news but NETFLIX is available. The workout facilities are pretty nice. The rooftop pool would be awesome in the summer. Even BBQs!

12007590,262638203,2018-05-09,47659927,Ian,There likely is not better value for money than James place in mid-town Toronto. Exceptional location great check-in service and communications. Comfy bed. It is exactly as advertised it is an older apartment but it is in the best shape possible given its age. The bathroom is good and functional and one day could be modernised. Stairs could be an issue for some but he does mention this. I recommend and would go back.

30905204,468084862,2019-06-11,267392177,Roberto,For someone using Airbnb for the very first time I have to say this was definitely a great experience. Room was very clean tidy and comfortable . Kenny was very quick whenever I had any questions or concerns regarding my room or stay. He is also just very kind in general and you can tell that he cares about providing his guests with a great service. Not a single bad thing here and not too far from downtown Toronto.

16779632,348020254,2018-11-12,208913472,Tanya,Great stay in the entertainment district! Super close to the CN tower and short distance to a lot of restaurants and bars. The place was very clean bed was surprisingly very comfortable. Carole left detailed instructions on location and how to check in and out which were extremely helpful for being in Toronto for the first time and not familiar with the area. I would definitely stay here again!

The place does feel like home -- it's clean spacious with comfortable furniture and in a great location. Perfect choice for anyone who wants to get the full Toronto experience!

5758430,77420751,2016-05-31,472166,Carole,Vinny's apartment was absolutely (Website hidden by Airbnb) central for practically (Website hidden by Airbnb) husband was there for the Red Sox series at the Rogers Centre which was literally a 3 minute walk away. Rooftop pool and cabanas looked lovely although we were on a tight schedule so unfortunately didn't get the chance to take advantage of it. Apartment is exactly as per photos/description and was spotlessly clean. Very comfortable bed. There is a 24 hour grocery store just one block away which was very convenient. An easy walk from Union Station if you are coming in from Pearson International Airport. Only met Vinny and his wife briefly on departure but he left clear instructions for picking up keys on arrival and was a very charming host. Would definitely recommend if you are in Toronto.
19552509,563933723,2019-11-14,6145134,Anne,Great view! It's very clean and conveniently located.
18389561,272545422,2018-06-03,1130952,Brian,Honestly this place was awesome. The location is near public transportation and also near an area of lively activity yet also surrounded by homes so it's quiet at night. Kris is a wonderful caring host and you can tell that he genuinely wants to ensure that when you're there you feel comfortable - but is also respectful and lets you do your own thing. It's a great value and it's clean. And I look forward to returning if I get the chance!

34545171,510138594,2019-08-15,154433191,Isabelle,Our stay at Vlad was perfect. The house is beautiful spacious and cosy. Very clean it also have many little attention to embellish your stay. Expresso machine coffee teas sugar and milk is left there for you upon arrival. Vlad is very quick to answer any demands and also suggest nice spot to discover in the area. The back patio with BBQ is a great place to relax at the end of the day. The place is safe and in a nice neighborhood. I strongly recommand and will not hesitate to stay there in the future.
818228,44390820,2015-08-25,25067459,Linh,I stayed at Amy's place for only a night but she was a wonderful host. The room was very nice clean and lovely. Amy gave me tips on eating places how to get around and made me feel really at home. I'd love to stay there next time I cone to Toronto. really gonna recommend it to my friends.
8756013,342303298,2018-10-28,61560716,Helen,Really enjoyed myself at Yadsa’s place. Both of them were an amazing host. House was very clean and beautiful. The location was great you have access to pretty much everything. They will respond back to you quickly. I’m very happy I’ve booked with them. I’ll definitely recommend them to everyone who wants to get away for few days. Thank you Yada. :)

Spotless clean very nicely decorated close to subway station and has on site parking available.
Great place and hosts.
Definitely recommend!"
29909089,358228182,2018-12-13,230379990,Anqi,This is a wonderful experience for me. Dean’s is beautiful and the view at night is good. Also near to everything I need. Can’t wait to come back again.
17907474,509482917,2019-08-14,163067928,Mark,Fantastic location!! Great for any visit to the heart of Toronto. Everything you could ask for is right there. MTCC Scotia Arena Rohers Place CN tower Ripley's Aquarium.. Amazing view of the city (most favorite place for a morning coffee was the balcony). The condo itself is gorgeous and building has plenty to assist your stay. Highly recommend this place. I look forward at staying there again in the future.  The Host and location will make your trip to Toronto the best one yet.
19789082,206914903,2017-10-27,13676458,Lalita,Great place clean and comfortable! Close to public transportation and comes with parking. Only thing to note is that they were doing construction outside during our stay and sound from the main house carries to the basement.
4058460,37441326,2015-07-07,25936042,Sarah,Had great time in this very well equipped condo. Was further out than we realised but the area was excellent. Great first time experience with airbnb. 
6336195,32626287,2015-05-19,4782361,Tenzin,Kate was a lovely host and their apartment was perfect for our weekend gateway! The free parking was a huge plus. The apartment  were clean and mint! Highly recommend and we would love to stay there again.
13063805,346671628,2018-11-09,102710987,Victoria,My boyfriend and I drove up to Toronto from Virginia and staying at Ben's place helped make our trip in the city even better than expected. We were able to park our car right out back and not worry about it all week. The apartment is right in the heart of it all. You don't have to walk far to find a great food shop a grocery store public transportation and shopping. The majority of the week we would set out on foot as most of all the popular tourist destinations were within a 15-20 minute walk. Otherwise there were tram stops right across the street and easy to get on. The place itself was very clean and homey a great place to take a mid-day break from sightseeing. I would recommend this spot to anyone who really wants to experience a hip part of the city of Toronto. Thanks Ben!
24206126,261589998,2018-05-06,68753527,Carly,The place was great for our quick trip to Toronto. Great location!
36168830,536900289,2019-09-27,41736079,Jessica,This was a great Airbnb for those who are looking for their home away from home. Kevin’s place had a reception desk as well as breakfast available. There was also an area to keep your luggage if you were exploring the city after you checked out. Great stay!
495303,82593635,2016-06-28,71376535,Ben,"What can I say? There should be no other place in your list.

Dany was always in touch for any need we had friendly social and very respectful of our privacy. 
The place was just what we were looking for and even the neighboors from across the street were great!

Place really close to the subway station and restaurants. Bed bathroom and kitchen all great!

During the first days we had a few bugs which danny fixed inmediately! (He was very concerned that we had a pleasant stay which we did).

I truly recommend his place!

Cheers"
19733269,337811139,2018-10-17,208039230,Jenny,Nice spot for a few days. The best thing about the place is that is very close to cute streets with shopping and cafes

23341705,529338180,2019-09-14,281839342,Raymond,This place was ideal for us being in the heart of downtown and having our car parked in the garage for the three days there. Being within a few minutes walk from all kinds of stuff and an Urban Fresh grocery store very close by to boot made our stay very enjoyable.
1016125,461446846,2019-05-31,2036126,Roxane,Jaclyn is a super fun person ! A true host that wants to meet and get to know her guests. Thanks for the nice evening !

14772340,159738845,2017-06-11,129074479,Elke,Dear Qun thanks so much for your friendly Welcome and the great Room. We enjoyed that you shared the Patio and your offers for breakfast. You are located so near to the center that it eas possible for us to walk Downtown and inhalate the Spirit of Toronto! We wish you the best cheers Elke and Susanne
19208241,500080753,2019-08-01,133758218,Paulina,Miss Margaret was super nice to me! She was very welcoming and make sure I was comfortable. The place has an amazing view and a great location. I think she really cares about her guests: she provides a small freezer for your own  and went as far as to have sunscreen in the bathroom (for those who didn’t bring one) and many more things. If I ever come back to Toronto I will definitely book this place again. Thanks for everything~
11698563,88823403,2016-07-25,53982108,Selton,Eu e a Cátia adoramos ficar em casa da Jéssica e o Anton . Eles foram muito acolhedores e deram todas orientações para passar uma semana maravilhosa em Toronto. Adoramos o quarto. A vista é magnífica localização ótima (perto de tudo). Superou as nossas expectativas. Se tiver que voltar pra Toronto não temos dúvidas que escolhemos ficar lá de novo.  Recomendo! !

Less expensive compared to the location of Toronto. All the visiting places of Toronto are nearby to his house. I recommend this house to the people who would like to visit Toronto and want to stay at minimal cost but want comfortable stay. 
37569476,534298142,2019-09-22,20264342,Deo,"Perfect midtown location. Beautiful apartment and amenities. Check-in and check-out couldn’t be any easier. Great host.

24755730,424969393,2019-03-17,83508130,Matthieu,"The room was super clean the bed is very confortable and the breakfast while simple was a great bonus.
There is a bit of noise with a delivery truck behind the housse the morning (not on sundays) but it's a great place. 
Yufang is very helpful and very nice toi!"

32239235,415763082,2019-02-23,171966471,Paula Elena,"Thank you so much Bobbi for everything.
Her house is good located in my opinion not to far from the city centre and there is a bus stop just in front of the house connected with metro line.
Bobbi make me felt like in my house  always helping me with everything and also once she has taken me to the supermarket with her car.
Two days after I arrived In Toronto it was my birthday and Bobbi bought a cake for me she and the other people living here celebrated my birthday with me with cake and te.
I recommend Bobbi’s house to everyone she is a very good host."

9994521,98059108,2016-08-29,12737888,Ann,We could not have picked a better place for our party of 6. The location was central with lots of interesting places literally right outside the door. The house was beautiful and exactly as described. Lots of stairs but the layout also provided separation and multiple places for 6 women to get ready for a night out on the town. The back patio was a dream and the house was very inviting and comfortable. Elise is a very gracious host who is very amenable and easy to communicate with. Would absolutely stay again and recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay. 
17141329,162611945,2017-06-21,117749733,Luke,Very clean.  Great apartment with all new amenities.  We really loved this place.  Close enough to walk nearly anywhere in the city.  We would definitely stay here again.  Great host as well.  Alan was always asking if we needed anything.  Thank you!
18306782,480344478,2019-07-02,12554879,Jay,This is a great place to stay in Toronto if you want to be right in the middle of everything. It's safe clean and convenient. Plus there's an absolutely gorgeous view of the city on the rooftop patio where you can relax BBQ and drink. Definitely worth checking out.
18462898,265873612,2018-05-18,64473160,Marlise,Michael was prompt with communication and accomodating as far as check in and check out times. His place was centrally located and as decribed.
23741771,278678608,2018-06-18,105268246,Christina,"You will want to Instagram the heck out of this place-- it's way nicer than any high star hotel I've ever stayed in. I was hesitant to share a bathroom but it turned out to be no problem-- I heard the other room's guest arrive and when they checked out the bathroom it took their breath away! It is gorgeous.

Other than the beautiful bathroom with amazing everything my favorite part was the quiet sitting area in the room to do some work as the sun came up. 

It was always a treat to come home after working in any of the nearby fun districts. Anywhere I wanted to go was easily accessible by a short walk and a quick streetcar or bus ride. Loved staying at Jessica's and I highly recommend it!"
16737229,475717061,2019-06-24,33924880,Jonathan,Fantastic stay! The place had loads of space for our group of five. Check-in was super easy. Location was super convenient with great cafes and restaurants just a few minutes walk away on Bloor and on Dupont.
21960826,357510527,2018-12-10,154413973,Priscilla,Great location (just a 15 minute walk from Yonge&Dundas) with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on! The room is on the small side but for me that's perfect =)
32251323,562138029,2019-11-10,306049363,Bobbie,Highly Recommend House is stunning with a real Toronto Vibe. Very friendly quick to respond. Great Price. Only Negative is the Parking but thats every where in Toronto!
17830497,348130792,2018-11-12,145267962,Owen,Nice place and great communication. Would recommend highly.
15188473,317713589,2018-09-02,19067539,Rajesh,Very beautiful and quiet place / neat and near to a big shopping mall. Must stay.
13769161,286190430,2018-07-05,95056908,Javier,This place is on a residential neighborhood near of the Junction where you can found pubs and stores. It's 10 minutes walking to Bloor Go station where you can take a train to airport or downtown. The place is great for 2 people Maureen and Harvey was very nice with us.
14336506,234922339,2018-02-14,172837538,Shaun,Accurately advertised.

3994370,456046241,2019-05-20,208668674,Maria,"I went there when was my Bday and they left me a note written by my girlfriend to make me feel at home (it was so sweet!). Also they'll give me tips about the best places to see and how to make it to Niagara Falls. The place is a short walk to the downtown core and it's close to two bus stops (parlament/shuter and queen/sackville). Although my best option was to rent a bike with the app ""cycleFinder""! You have a stop one block away. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet. 
You just have to get used to that there are more people who can make noise at night"
16148133,281809211,2018-06-25,174672312,Rebecca,This location is amazing! Great space for 1 or 2 guests and despite being on a busy street it is relatively quiet inside.  Great experience overall!
19698563,534251828,2019-09-22,150760698,Patrixia,Let me start off with the good: great location very convenient to everything including the TTC (public transit) and GO Train. Very beautiful view super close to the CN tower and the water. Check in was easy concierge was very nice. A lot of airBNB guests checking in. Downside: place is small (which we expected) the walls were dirty (there were marks everywhere) and pool and gym off limit to guests of the building; only for owners. If you’re looking for something that is close to the CN tower area and the water and you’ll be out exploring for the most part this is the perfect place for you. Host was very quick to respond as well. Could be cleaner and shouldn’t state that pool and gym are included amenities as the key fob cannot open the doors for it and as well as front desk said it is not available for guests
15806052,466690198,2019-06-09,134534337,Curt,Great little place close to everything that had parking to boot.  Definitely recommend Tanya & Vitaly's place.
4040460,167681922,2017-07-07,86576727,Gregory,This is a small apartment (2 people max) located in a good part of town with easy access to public transportation and an excellent grocery store (Loblaws) a couple of blocks away.  The apartment has everything you need including a washer/dryer!  It is a garden level apartment located at the back of the complex so is quiet but also a bit dark.  The A/C is noisy and runs for a surprisingly long intervals given the apartment's small size.  Light sleepers should bring ear plugs.
16938170,231320070,2018-01-31,159574019,Jieun,Wonderful place!
9382997,55708572,2015-12-04,50367306,Craig,"Wonderful hosts.  They were flexible and able to accommodate my same day request for lodging. The accommodation was private clean and updated.  Steps from my event on the Danforth.  Parking was available but I drive  a large truck so alternative parking was just seconds away.

Thanks for the chocolates on my Pillow!"
13224752,159737115,2017-06-11,29636377,Romain,Logement dans un quartier résidentiel situé en sous sol avec une légère odeur et un peu d humidité. Le logement est accessible en transport en commun depuis le centre ville en métro (ligne 2 arrêt royal York ou kipling) puis en bus. Le logement est peu équipé. Hôte réactives à nos demandes. 
21786774,243598638,2018-03-16,58626676,Frederick,Suited all my needs quiet parking easy clean.  I’ll be back.
17712437,164238420,2017-06-26,51380504,Adam,"Eric's place was great. It was extremely convenient to anywhere you needed to be. The TTC was at the end of the block and it was a quick ride into downtown. The only complaint was that you could hear the subway passing by but that was really the least of my concerns after staying in places like NYC and Havana.

We were very happy and would absolutely stay again."
24021226,319141648,2018-09-05,67883308,Erin,Cute apartment with a nice view of the CN tower and Rogers Centre. Perfect for a couple looking to stay in a quieter area but still close to major attractions. Very close to King St and Queen St W - lots of unique restaurants pubs and cafes. Clean space and the balcony is definitely a plus!
19071480,323058110,2018-09-14,3655702,Lukia,John and LIse's place is cosy and right smack dab in a fun part of the city. John is super friendly and helpful. We couldn't have asked for a better experience.
14837477,231497469,2018-02-01,18408191,Adam,This was a great place to stay not far from the airport. Room was bigger than expected and Andrea has thought of everything. Everything I needed and more was provided and communication with Andrea before and during my stay was great. No complaints at all- would definitely stay again!
34096583,495176491,2019-07-25,137183158,Jeff,Great location super clean. Would stay again Joan is kind and communicates well.
13353622,99961256,2016-09-06,18859231,Gosia,Carolyn's communication pre- and during my stay was great. Carolyn even let me leave my suitcases at her after the check-out as I had a late flight and it would have been a nightmare if I had to drag them with me across Toronto. Plus her cats are sheer cuteness. Thanks for a great stay :)

Harry was here to our arrival and he was really welcoming. On our first morning we took our coffee/muffins with him and it was really interesting to talk about our respectives lives and country with him. He also was here to our departure.
If we have to back to Toronto we'll baldy return in his house.
Don't hesitate choose Harry's room !

26871921,296369748,2018-07-25,5545157,Samantha,Comfortable clean and stylish space. The building has its share of elevator issues but this can't really be blamed on the host. Would recommend.

34811374,558983664,2019-11-03,213849658,Alex,"Lydia was simply amazing! She accommodated my friend and I visiting from Montreal. The location is right by downtown so getting around is no issue whatsoever. The host was very quick with responses and answered all of our needs instantly.

I would recommend this place highly for anyone visiting from outside and locals needing a place close to downtown."
23187168,262399716,2018-05-08,188417333,Shealynn,Osmund's place is COMFORTABLE CLEAN & SAFE first and foremost. He's very friendly and accomodating. He replied quickly even on last notice and late at night. We arrived much later than the location typically allows and he was incredibly kind about that. He quickly told us how to get in and out and left us be for the evening. This was my first Airbnb experience and Osmund was a perfect host.

19789082,327201831,2018-09-23,412554,Sasha,Place is OK super basic but good location if you just need to sleep near the UP station. I saw a mouse twice which was not a nice surprise.

454927,143371454,2017-04-11,117651101,Koray,Unsere Erwartungen an diese Unterkunft und vor allem am Host David wurden nicht nur erfüllt sondern bei weitem übertroffen. Wir wurden in eine stilvoll eingerichtete und sehr saubere Wohnung empfangen (bitte Schuhe ausziehen). David hat uns einen kühlen Orangensaft angeboten und führte uns durch die Zimmer. Diverse Zettel erklären zusätzlich die Funktionen der einzelnen Geräte in seiner Wohnung. Er hat wirklich an alles gedacht. Neben Handtüchern Citymaps und universellen Adaptersteckern hat er auch u.a. Bagels Cornflakes Cookies Wasser Osaft Milch und Kaffee besorgt so dass ihr morgens frühstücken und gestärkt in den Tag starten könnt - und das ohne Zusatzkosten! Sogar eine SIM-Karte hat er uns angeboten. Wir konnten die Küche vollends nutzen und Dawid gibt einem mit seiner Art das Gefühl zu Hause zu sein. Wir hatten für jeden Tag neue Handtücher unsere Betten wurden überraschenderweise nochmal besser gemacht und zum Abschluss hat er uns einen Van als Taxi zum Flughafen organisiert. Wir bedanken uns bei David für die wundervollen Tage in seiner Wohlfühloase. 
8566821,313570616,2018-08-25,211340725,Evan,Great place
11533218,129561022,2017-01-31,74193092,Elyse,"This place was great! The area was wonderful the view was amazing (wish I would have stayed there in the summer so I could have enjoyed the balcony + the open windows - will def stay again if I can!)  Alper was an accommodating host and got us checked in a couple hours early. This was very helpful for us as we were coming from out of town. 
Check in and checkout were easy!!
Parking was a little confusing trying to find the right elevators and the way around in the parking garage but we did it! 

The only thing my husband and I would have loved is if there were a couple more bed pillows maybe a sheet for the bed instead of just the duvet and possible a extra blanket/throw for the couch to feel more comfy. We noticed there wasn't any other sheets that we could find if someone was going to sleep on the sofa bed. 

We really liked how Alper had water and coffee on hand. As well as a stocked cupboard of some other food essentials. Also including sugar spices oatmeal crackers etc. 

Thanks for a wonderful stay! We hope to be back again!!

18794901,416577172,2019-02-24,128997034,Felice,This is an amazing bargain--my workshop-mates were amazed. It is 1 block to U of T and tons of shops. It is close to many galleries and museums. A walk to Kingston  neighborhood. It was safe clean and quiet. Kylie has so many little products to use etc. if you forget anything-she goes above and beyond. I would completely recommend her place.
13101306,97675564,2016-08-28,36793028,Olivier,The apartment and Hilary were amazing! Right across the street from the beach and the free Olympic outdoor rooftop swimming pool and an adorable apartment! If/when we come back we'll go back to the same place!

23732461,340324692,2018-10-23,21068887,Katy,Very close to Chinatown. Lots to see and do. A nice area to just stroll and explore. The layout of the space is a little odd. You have to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom and kitchen. Important to know in case you are traveling with others that will be sleeping in the living room.
18682162,249077313,2018-04-01,35880096,Nicolaas,Nice room in a good place; everything you need when you travel on a budget

28715930,487030126,2019-07-13,269330137,Tin Hinan,Expérience horrible: présence de nombreux cafards dans la maison du sang sur les oreillers parterre crasseux portes cassées  meubles extrêmement  poussiéreux et lits qui grincent au moindre mouvement. Sans parler du réveil brutal et du ton agressif pris par le copain de la propriétaire pour nous reprocher indûment d’avoir garer la voiture à la mauvaise place. A fuir!!!!
849500,14965387,2014-06-30,15033954,Lou,Olivia was an amazing host very kind charming and definitely an easy going person.  I was able to meet her on the first day that I arrived and she was very sweet and very accommodating and would give me advice on certain places to go around the city. Her place is gorgeous and I was able to quickly make myself at home.  It was incredibly easy to get downtown walkable and very close to union station.  I had no problems what so ever with my stay at Olivia's and I would most definitely consider staying there again.
15178135,422970157,2019-03-12,244738162,Morgan,This was my first experience with air bnb and the host made it very easy to communicate! Any questions that came up she responded within 20 minutes at most. The check in and check out process were simple. The location was perfect and within a mile walking distance to most everything downtown. Be aware there is no parking associated with the building itself but there are numerous parking garages near the apartment building which you will have to pay for. The pictures on the air bnb site look exactly the same in person which was great as you never know what to expect. Taylor was a great host and I recommend this spot to everyone!
24935005,404342075,2019-01-23,164844385,Kevin,Lydia responded quickly to messages. Quick and convenient check in and out. Found the place to not be quite as clean as the pictures/descriptions advertised we had to rewash most of our dishes was missing a few kitchen items we had been expecting such as oven mitts. Building is in a great location for downtown though the elevators and hallways were also somewhat grimy. Overall it was an okay stay.
14340935,212608124,2017-11-18,39230012,Maddie,Steve’s place is great if you are looking to have a quick walk to downtown. He was very accommodating and helpful. Thanks again!

13814263,316103904,2018-08-30,99944828,Amy,Absolutely incredible location and view!  The hosts were wonderful and the space was terrific- modern and comfortable.  One suggestion - Be sure to leave extra time when leaving the building - depending on the time of day - waiting for an elevator can be time consuming.  
28522290,548392513,2019-10-17,8750445,Ella,This place is amazing! It’s located in an convenient way close to highway downtown and a walk from High park. The apartment is charming and suits well travellers with children or two couples travelling together.

If you have a car be advised finding the parking spot for the unit is quiet challenging and confusing not your average round about garage but more like zig zag. i suggest upon check in to have host show you exactly where the underground parking spot is  and how to enter the building from the under ground and vic versa. Great amenities! 15 min to downtown via car/Uber.

14586613,414000083,2019-02-18,71164778,Audra,A short walk from Union Station and access to the waterfront and many attractions made this spot great. On the 32nd floor you did not hear traffic or trains. My daughter loved the pool and hot tub available on site. WiFi was an appreciated amenity!  The only thing that disappointed us was that the pictures and description showed a view of the CN Tower and there is not one due to construction. Overall we had a great stay.
12233086,115049154,2016-11-21,27089592,Morgane,"Très bon séjour. La proximité d'une station de métro depuis l'appartement est à peine à quelques pas : c'était vraiment l'idéal pour pouvoir profiter pleinement du charme de Toronto. Avec Alexandre et Sarah : nous avons gardé le contact par email tout du long et ont été rapidement réceptif à nos demandes. Cette appartement est l'idéal pour un couple il est petit et cosy. La grande télé avec Netflix : un gros point positif pour les soirées fraîches ;).
Cependant la grasse mat n'est pas possible : le métro est juste en dessous du basement et il est vrai qu'il y a une petite résonance depuis l'appartement où vit Alexandre et Sarah. Mais qui a besoin de dormir aussi tard pour visiter Toronto ? ;-)

18461931,472892777,2019-06-20,6097525,Diana,"It was a great pleasure staying here..  guests have the best room.. not in the attic not in the basement but on the main floor the main entrance  and a room with lots of light and easy acess. I loved the private front porch for guests with the swing.. pefect for reflection or better yet like having a  private office for working online! 
The location is excellent a block from the park and two steps to College Street and excellent coffee! Downtown is easily accessible by metro or streetcar.
Best of all the family is  delightful and a joy to be around although the division of space means all parties are very private too. I slept like a top and woke up very refreshed. Superb private shower. All in all good quality and unpretentious  this could be one of the best air bnbs ever!"

17537298,484307528,2019-07-08,192235,Roz,Wyn’s place is exactly as it is described and photographed. There are good ideas to distinguish which bedroom is yours. We had the green room which was large comfortable and welcomingly cool. Parking and public transport are a 2 minute walk away and for $3 you can park overnight in a city parking lot. The house although home to several guest bedrooms and a little impersonal covers all the necessities for a realistic fee. We would stay at Wyn’s place again. Thank you Wyn.

She also left suggestions of art galleries in the surrounding area which were unique and worth the walk. A view of the CN Tower as the sun rose was nice to wake up to in the morning. Thanks for sharing your home Cassandra.

10379408,340641298,2018-10-24,72134783,Brian,Fanta's condo is in an ideal location and worked well for me as a single business traveller. The room is a bit sparsely furnished but I was able to spread out a bit in the living room to get some emails done. All in all good value a clean room and a friendly host so can't ask for much more!
19947180,199961833,2017-10-03,23589959,Catherine,"Despite some initial confusion Cynthia was gracious and accommodating. I was booking at the very last minute for someone else – not something I would normally do and probably won't do again. 

Cynthia's is a good place to stay if you're travelling on a budget – the room is clean the apartment is nicely set up."

Fast communication with the host who cares about making your stay comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again.
13298933,195986806,2017-09-21,23187164,Nina,This place could not be in a more perfect location. It is close to bars restaurants shops cafes and parks.

Their area is very nice. In about 10 mins you can hit Roncevalles and there are many quaint cafes and restaurants. It’s nice to see the old world charm of the Polish still present in the area. Everything is easily accessible by transit and I would highly recommend it to anyone if you’re one or two travelers. A wonderful visit!"
9864534,461434476,2019-05-31,30464869,Nuria,"The place is stylish and the location is great specially for University of Toronto. Oliver is very fast to respond to any issues you may have. The check-in and check-out are made very simple.
The place is as shown in the pictures maybe a bit more worn out.  It has all necessary appliances and more (large table nice desk ...). The place is indeed bright because the window is huge but privacy is an issue if you have the curtains open (because it is on the first floor above the street level). 
Overall a very pleasant stay. These were just minor issues compared to the global balance."

But the best place to hang is the apartment; airy full of light and extremely comfortable. The bed is heavenly and the shower made me want to move in! Plus Matt was so helpful and accommodating that he made our trip a breeze. You will love this place.

23292976,288791922,2018-07-10,3160467,Anna,Great private apartment a short walk away from great Toronto neighborhoods! The apartment is well-equipped including kitchen  and laundry closet.  The enclosed sun deck is relaxing and it feels like a very nice home away from home.  Good wifi service.  Drake was very easy to communicate with and fast with responses.  When I asked him for some laundry detergent to use in the washing machine he provided it promptly.  Btw in-apartment laundry is an awesome amenity for long-ish stays.   The apartment was in a great location I was able to explore so much of Toronto both on foot and via BikeshareToronto bikes (there are 4 dock stations within quick walk of the apartment).  Highly recommended for a stay in Toronto -- live like a local!

35686267,546455722,2019-10-13,39959293,Lauren,"PROS:
-Easy and short walk from the city airport 
-Easy check-in process
-Quick communication from host 
-Minus lots of stray hairs on the floors and bathroom the pictures are accurate of the apt. It’s beautiful and spacious apt with comfy beds.

CONS:
-The window in the apt facing the street was broken so we to manually fix it ourselves to not stay awaken by the street noise.
-The fire alarm went off the first night for literally 35 minutes the first night at 4am. There was terrible communication from the building manager on what to do if it was real etc. was ridiculous 
-“Verification process”. So this was the least Airbnbing feeling place I’ve ever stayed at and I’ve stayed at a lot. Most of that is due to the lack of human interaction you normally experience at an Airbnb where the home owner greets you tells you about home the neighborhood etc. This was a very transactional process where I never met anyone. Because they don’t have a person to greet you they make you do this extra verification process where they notify you on check-in day (and not before) that they need a copy of your ID and your credit card information. Very uncomfortable. Especially since I’ve already given those to Airbnb. Furthermore once you give them that info they say it’s just for verification and you won’t be charged. Guess what? They put a $50 hold on my card as soon as they got the info. Because they have engineered a human out of their process - they make you go through additional security so they can feel comfortable and protected. For me the very nice apt is not worth the transactional experience."

17712437,488100334,2019-07-14,47831498,Fatima,Our stay at Eric and Annemarie was fine. The place had lots of insects that kept on crawling despite constant cleaning. Some were centipedes spiders and a few were potato bugs. Washroom sink was tiny and had some drainage issues. The only good thing was it was close to subway .We have stayed in other Airbnb’s too. I think its too pricey for the basement and amenities being provided.

The apartment was clean and tidy.  We were so grateful for the fact that it was air conditioned being as hot as it was this week.  It was such a relief to get in after long active days exploring the city with family and friends.  The neighbors we had were very friendly and considerate.  We would definately recommend friends and family to stay at any place Nick and Nina have listed!  Thank you two for the awesome location and abode!  Cheers!

6523655,471519159,2019-06-17,267233004,Christine,Great location for what we needed. We had many sights to see along King and Queen St. and it was super easy to get an Uber to other parts of DT. There's a convenience store right on the corner and just down the street is a Starbucks and many other food options as well as the streetcar which brings you right back to her street! Laura was super friendly and responded to my inquiries quickly and politely. It was a warm artsy environment-and her art is awesome! Also the two cats were super friendly and love attention. I also appreciated how Laura seemed so environmentally friendly down to the products available for guests.
1856109,308075364,2018-08-15,8196567,Pierre,OK to spend a night or two...

31203044,524276541,2019-09-05,93795592,Thom,Jesse and Michelle’s place was a great space for a home away from home in Toronto. Nice neighbourhood perhaps a little further out of town than initially thought. Space was clean and modern and very homely. The lack of natural light and noise of being in the basement would be the only slight negatives. Overall would 100% recommend.
19831971,557624035,2019-11-01,64988101,Alex,Great location and host! Highly recommended
3807461,98119153,2016-08-29,4371911,Kai,Peter took me in on short notice because my initial accommodation fell through. Not only did he go out of his way to make this possible he also was super friendly took me out for food and immediately made me feel like home. His place is one of a kind with a beautiful unique character. An industrial loft with a stylish interior. The communication with Peter was also effortless and prompt and he answered any questions immediately via text. Absolutely recommend staying at his amazing place. You will have a wonderful experience!
1885950,79614323,2016-06-13,35459173,Cosmina,Tom was quick to respond and answer any questions and a great host! The place met all of our needs and was in a perfect location
436403,116664268,2016-12-02,78622652,Stephanie,"Our stay was great.  Derek was great to work with.  We have a 1 year old and the stairs in the home are not ideal but Derek left us a baby gate and plug covers!  It was a very nice surprise.  When we first pulled up to the location we were concerned as it didn't seem the best of areas however we quickly realized it was completely fine!  its a great location and walking distance to everything.  The Metro grocery is in walking distance as well which was convenient.  The parking across the street was 5 every time you pulled but we paid 120 for the week.
All in all it was a great place to stay and Derek is great to work with!"
23880006,332540032,2018-10-05,31774178,Becky,Sandro’s place provides comfy beds fluffy towels and a great coffee machine as well as being stylishly decorated and a comfortable cosy place to stay. Would come back here if im in Toronto again.

Her place was spotless full of character and ideally located downtown close to numerous subway stops. More than happy to stay here again next time I'm looking for a reasonably priced place downtown. "
6947407,136880149,2017-03-12,5804513,Katerina,We had a great time staying here - great location very large rooms and an excellent library.  Ben was easy to communicate with and very accommodating when we were looking for a later check out time.

11678924,88147924,2016-07-23,81711397,Kylia,"Perfect location and Roman was always available to answer any questions we had. Apartment was spacious and clean. This was my first Airbnb experience and I was overly impressed will most likely never stay at a hotel again and hope to stay at Romans again when I head back to Toronto.

Only hiccup we had was a parking issue at the building therefore I ended up having to pay some extra $ to park across the street for my last 4 days there.

Thanks again for everything Roman!!!!"

26562632,561101910,2019-11-08,169406275,Cassandra,The location of this place is a dream! Steps from so many restaurants and the CN Tour! Really a good place to stay for tourists like me. There were a few little things that concerned me such as all the furniture was not the same as in the pictures there was not a single napkin or paper towel in the whole place also the smoke alarm went off no matter what we tried cooking (even though there was not a speck of visible smoke). All fairly little things for the price and location just things I thought others would like to know as I would have.
32213374,481920085,2019-07-05,32901440,Nancy,"If you are looking for a clean stylish  large space right across from the sky dome this is a wonderful choice. 
Bedrooms are spacious for a Toronto condo and the included parking is a real bonus. 
One elevator was  down so long waits. Tip: use the stairs going out as the unit is on the third floor. Sadly you must use the crowded  slow elevators going up."
32643640,424964111,2019-03-17,169577118,Kristine,Place is amazing great size location is perfect!

As they also live on site shared spaces were kept clean regularly. The addition of washer and dryer use was very helpful as we were there for two weeks. They're both very nice and approachable people had a very pleasant stay overall.
5869076,254921296,2018-04-18,162108639,Tina,Bissa and Milan are great hosts.  Location is great - walking distance to shops and restaurants and close to film studios as well.  The place was spacious and clean and had all the utensils needed in the kitchen for short or long term stay.  I would recommend Bissa's place to anyone looking to get away for the weekend or a longer stay to tour the city and while enjoying the benefits of a home.  I would definitely book again.  Thank you!!
19359743,176725985,2017-07-31,34861742,Jamie,Ali's place is great! Right in the middle of downtown. You can walk almost anywhere. Air Canada Center Rodgers Center CN Tower and so much more are very close. Awesome restaurants are close by. Quick access to the train. You can't beat this location. Ali was an excellent host. He even allowed us to check-in early. He communication was great. I definitely would stay again when I'm back in Toronto.

There are many old buildings around. Very pretty

13715751,120304369,2016-12-09,50942378,J.P.,Awesome place and location.  Check in is easy and communication for check in was perfect.  3 minutes walk to Union Station and to Bay and Front.  I stayed for work and easy walk to the offices.  Right next to Air Canada Center and next to grocery store and LCBO.  Grocery Store has prepared meals that are awesome if you need something quick.  Great workout room.  Great place to stay if you are in Toronto for an extended time.

22233892,262024443,2018-05-07,13836838,Kristen,A quick & comfortable stopover in Toronto at Adam & Allison’s cute home. Very friendly folk unfortunately we didn’t get to chill & chat as I was pretty much in & out! I would definitely book again in the future.

14398733,275143051,2018-06-10,85685576,Gabriela,My husband and I spent a week at Deepa and Mario’s place and really enjoyed it. It is a little bit far from downtown Toronto about an hour but we already knew that before going so it was fine for us. On our last day Deepa prepared some indian food for us and gave us some of their homemade wine it was reaally good! This is a quiet place to relax after a hectic day getting to know the town. 
14152093,100478052,2016-09-09,88342403,Meshal,"The place is clean and in a decent neighbourhood. Sophie and her husband are nice and very hospitable. The upstairs bedroom is a little warm as the air-conditioning isn't strong enough to cool it so at noon the room gets a little stuffy.
The washing machine didn't work the first few days I was there but they fixed it afterwards but there is no dryer. 
Good place decent price good neighbourhood clean close to public transport."

Access codes to get in went smoothly as did the overall stay. Betty's Bar a few blocks away is a cool hangout to have a few tasty brews.

Nikki was a responsive host and always replied quickly to my queries.

I would recommend it!"
2721128,64213467,2016-03-01,10696228,Syriah,Great for transport (24hr street car outside the house). Everything I needed was there including extra towels plates etc. Nick answered my texts immediately and dropped by to check I was settling in okay. Very happy with my stay here. Thanks Nick and Nena!

13682064,94378873,2016-08-15,10257008,Hatty & Johnny,We had an amazing time at this home. Let me say that it looks even better in person.  The place has everything you can imagine and want in a home...heated floors amazing huge bathtub with good quality amenities upscale kitchen very tasteful home decor and details and good space for our friends to chat and relax.  Erin greeted us with some delicious bread from a local pastry and fresh flowers it is walking distance from a very trendy/hipster part of the neighborhood filled with good coffee juiceries shopping etc. There was a convenient parking space for our rental car. There is also a really nice private patio space on the roof where you can watch the sunset and have a nice view of the tower and city. Just to note that the two queen beds in the two smaller bedrooms were sofa beds but they were very comfortable and we would have never noticed the difference. Also there are a lot of stairs but wasn't too big of a problem for us. Really one of the best airbnb experiences we have had! Thank you so much for everything Erin and your prompt responses! :)
20772929,458146590,2019-05-25,10353493,Jesse,Everything was fantastic everyone had a great time in the city and Zoey's place is perfect for exploring Toronto. Thanks Zoey!

17154713,180934245,2017-08-11,43729280,Moira,Marnie and Tom's place is perfect! Clean tranquil comfortable and totally well-equipped for a long-term stay. Unfortunately I was only visiting for one night. But Marnie and Tom made that one night perfect! After a serious flight delay my 3:30 AM checkin was unbelievably smooth. Marnie also went out of her way to send my directions to my next destination after Toronto: so sweet and really above and beyond the duties of an Airbnb host. Returning to Marnie and Tom/Toronto is a priority!
16792842,487105188,2019-07-13,107443163,Christine,The host was very nice and asked me about my day if I needed anything. I would recommend bringing earplugs and a fan in the summer. You can hear all the creaks and cracks and voices in the house.
23003720,265579568,2018-05-17,174725199,Andreas,We had a wonderful stay at Pierres place!  I would recomend anyone who's going to Toronto to stay there! Pierre was also very helpful and answered all the questions we had.

1592045,228013931,2018-01-17,47965823,Sotiris,Sheena was an amazing host! It felt like living with a dear friend one that will always lend a hand if you need something always coming up with great recommendations about places and great stories! The flat was very clean and downtown close to all the museums and cool places. The view was really impressive with all the skyscrapers as well as the hot tub in the roof where you can unwind enjoying the view. I highly recommend this place!
9975789,156124209,2017-05-29,29129667,Jerry,Great location and host! My friends and I enjoyed Clark's Airbnb for the long Memorial weekend. I would highly recommend to all travelers seeking Toronto.
23439208,447432768,2019-05-03,67510957,Seungwook (Kevin),He was great to response detailed information that I needed quickly. I stayed his condo with my co-workers as business trip. I would like to stay in there again as vacation.

The hot water pressure was excellent and I slept like a log in the master bedroom bed."

1902398,151189526,2017-05-11,91985190,Taylor,Scott's place is great! Very close to restaurants and nightlife! We walked to most places near the condo and found many places to eat within walking distance. It was also awesome to be so close to the aquarium and CN tower. The condo itself was very clean and comfortable! I highly recommend staying at Scott's condo if you're looking for a condo close to nightlife and entertainment! Just a small warning about construction of a new condo building next door. The noise wasn't bad they just start early during the week (around 7am.) Scott provides ear plugs though so that was nice! Overall it's a great great place to stay! 
529189,281182752,2018-06-24,169179181,Fernanda,"Minha hospedagem na casa de Caroline foi decepcionante. Ela respondeu à todas as minhas mensagens antes do check in e avisou-me que por questões pessoais não poderia estar presente durante a minha estadia mas deixaria um amigo como responsável para me receber. Porém esse amigo/anfitrião não tinha nenhuma habilidade para hospedar!
Assim que cheguei ele deteve-se apenas em falar sobre as regras da casa e a partir disso só respondia quando eu me dirigia à ele. 
O meu quarto estava muito empoeirado e desencadeou uma alergia terrível! Pedi que limpasse mas mesmo assim não melhorou quase nada. A sala do primeiro andar que era passagem obrigatória para o meu quarto era muito bagunçada com pilhas de toalhas sujas impossibilitando qualquer momento de descanso. O fogão também estava sujo impedindo o preparo de comida.
Infelizmente em nome da minha saúde fui obrigada a sair antes da casa. "
26234162,450860693,2019-05-10,175181056,Dennis,Great place to stay!

445708,38288302,2015-07-14,18491361,Robert,My wife and I rented Megan's apartment and had a great experience.  The apartment is in the middle of Kensington Market.  You come out the front door of the apartment building and you can walk a half block and get coffee bread cheese fruits and almost any cuisine imaginable.  The street car station is also half block away that can get you anywhere in downtown Toronto.  The pictures accurately depict the apartment.  Wonderfully tall ceilings in a loft space.  Lots of room to unwind in after a day of sightseeing.  The building is secure and well maintained. Megan was great to deal with and provided us with a thorough list of things to  do places to see and recommended restaurants bistros and stores both in the Kensington Market locale and the downtown Toronto area. We had a very enjoyable experience and would rent this apartment again the next time our travels take us to Toronto. 
15940976,116666417,2016-12-02,2065591,Suzanne,Great central location for anyone with business or pleasure plans in downtown Yorkville or the Annex.  Subway station at your back door was so convenient!  The apartment itself was clean well furnished and has everything you need for a relaxing stay.  The bed was comfortable with soft linens.  The in suite laundry was a real bonus. Great stay! :-)

1560977,170895324,2017-07-16,119044873,Mark,Zita's place was absolutely perfect for us. It was clean cozy and the perfect location for our visit to Toronto. Zita was friendly and welcoming and check-in and check-out were super simple. I would highly recommend Zita's place to anyone traveling to Toronto and looking for a great place to stay close to Exhibition Place and Ontario Place.
13712967,99654674,2016-09-05,88581455,Martin,My family and I were so thrilled with our stay. Laurence's and Vivan's home is spacious clean and equipped with everything you need. The house has some much character it really made our stay comfortable and pleasant we felt right at home. The location is great easy access to public transit or a quick drive downtown. Such a great experience I would recommend their place to anyone visiting Toronto with friends or family. I know we'll be back here for our next Toronto visit. 
17222372,234387966,2018-02-12,151109305,Vedrana,"Beautiful apartment with an amazing view. Comfortably fit my family of 5. The apartment had pots pans and other kitchen supplies needed for a family that prefers to cook (my family). Gord was also quite responsive ensured our stay was comfortable in Toronto.

I loved the two separate bathrooms with showers as we had additional time to get ready in the morning. What a difference! Our parking spot was convenient and close to the elevators of the building.There’s a grocery store and sports bar within 2 min of the apartment how convenient!? 

Will return in the future."

19698563,354947581,2018-12-02,102055941,인영,위치와 뷰를 제외한 모든것이 별로인 숙소다. 침구류에는 많은 얼룩이 있고 화장실과 주방은 더러웠다.
5037911,493453113,2019-07-22,133757060,Zac,Annie's Toronto townhome was perfect for our needs. While we did enjoy our stay we have recommended additional amenities and touches to the host that would help make a booking from good to great for her guests. Overall great experience.
872128,21003531,2014-10-09,17191372,Helen,Great location in the heart of Liberty Village very close to lots of lovely cafes places for breakfast (I recommend School) and decent fast food  for those late nights (we visited the poutine place a few times!)! Also a huge 24 hour supermarket just a 5 minute walk from the apartment. We walked to the Queen Street area (about 15/20 minuets) which has lots of lovely boutique shops and great restaurants and bars. Very easy access to central downtown just a 5 minute walk to the King Street tram. The apartment is comfortable and as described with all necessities. However if you are planning to cook be aware the cookware available is basic and there is no indoor dining table. Other than that the apartment was perfect for exploring the city for a few days. This was our first airbnb experience and we would definitely use it again. Thanks Rahul. 
6091034,87168286,2016-07-18,53580889,Simon,We had an easy contact with Camille to make all arangements. Key was easy available. Place was clean. Ideal house for families with children. The toys and games were a pleasant surprise for the kids. Ideal location for visit of Toronto

20285249,244435365,2018-03-18,168828326,John,My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay here. I wouldn't recommend having more than 2 people unless others are comfortable with sleeping on a pull out bed. All in all we did enjoy our stay and the location is great. Also the breakfast at Harrison's restaurant was great! I would definitely come back to this place!

6925517,54993349,2015-11-27,46140949,Annika,"Vielen Dank für die tolle Ferienwohnung. Ich war rundum zufrieden. Ich konnte meine Checkinzeit frei wählen die Wohnung war wie auf den Fotos sehr schön und gemütlich und es war klasse dass wir sogar Sachen aus dem Kühlschrank benutzen konnten.
Die Unterkunft war sauber gut ausgestattet und in super Lage zum Subway. Für 1150$ Tagespreis konnten wir so die Stadt sehr unkompliziert erkunden und uns nacher auf die warme Wohnung freuen. Nur die Leute in unserer Nachbarschaft/den anderen Wohnungen waren mir etwas unsympathisch/ bewirkte etwas ein Gefühl der Unsicherheit aber es ist nichts erwähnenswertes passiert.
Alles in allem ein sehr gelungener Urlaub in schöner Wohnung. Würde ich wieder so machen :)"

19458394,266811642,2018-05-20,185723610,Sydney,"Great place to stay! Jennifer was very thorough with instructions and making sure we had everything we needed to check in smoothly and have a great stay.

It's an especially great place to stay if you're looking to spend some time at the bars/attractions in the church and wellesley village as it's a three minute walk from everything there.

The room was clean nice and very comfortable and her itinerary set up is great and really helpful.

The only thing I would say and honestly it has nothing to do with Jennifer or her room because they were fantastic and well kept is just the hallways to the building could use some upkeep. So don't judge when you get there by that because her room is very nice and clean.

I definitely recommend it great condo great location and great host."

13885036,436695197,2019-04-13,105802193,Kelly,"Great location. Walking distance to Rogers centre ACC CN tower etc. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby also. The place was really clean had Netflix and wifi which was cool. The host responded to all of my questions very promptly which was much appreciated. 

Check in was a bit complicated as we went to the same suite in the wrong tower and the woman said it happens often so ensure you’re going to the right spot haha....and we struggled getting into the building until we got the FOB from inside the condo. Also should specify to take the high rise elevators. The lamps and the outlets in the bedroom didn’t work. These are just minor things of course.... Overall this was a great spot to stay in the city and I would likely stay here again."

I was very surprised to see the level of cleanliness and readiness of the host. The washroom is shared with the house but rarely ever found it occupied it has all what you need shampoo soap and even conditioner.

Constantine has been more than understanding when I informed him of my flight delay and he allowed me to stay couple hours over my check out time.

And to forget to mention the house location its located in a very nice clean and safe area and laterally few minutes from downtown. 

I completely loved my stay at the house. Thanks Constantine."
21582034,277127650,2018-06-15,171794139,Sabrina,Hallo die Unterkunft ist sehr gut gelegen allerdings ist der Baulärm enorm. Direkt vor dem Gebäude ist eine große Baustelle. Das Appartement ist geräumig und es ist alles vorhanden was man benötigt wie z.B. Waschmaschine Trockner etc. Beim Check-in hatten wir Probleme bei der Anleitung. Selbst unsere Freundin vor Ort kam nicht rein sodass wir den Vermieter kontaktieren mussten. Ansonsten war es ok.

It was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable. The location is a short transit ride to the core and within walking distance of several other great spots. Priya is a thoughtful and responsive host. We would definitely recommend her place.

Thank you so much you are really a very amazing and down to earth person. In fact in last few days you have become a wonder friend to me also. Everything was well organised by you and that to in such a detailing. He was waiting for me on the checking inn day and then he made gr8 tea and coffee for me. He took me out to in his car for looking out a place for my family later this month. I would love to come back and stay with him as its feel like my 2nd home.

Once again thanks for all the help.

regards
Vikram"

10521800,272537174,2018-06-03,192513507,Eduardo,recomendable si considerar el gasto adicional del estacionamiento.
17942852,543349257,2019-10-07,21918143,Tony,"First I must say Tarit was an excellent host! He was mindful and helpful during our stay. 

Second the photos look great but being in the space in person the photos really do not do this listing justice. The views are just inspiring and incredible. If you are on the fence on where to stay in Toronto just pick this place. You will thank yourself later.

You are literally 15 mins walking from a majority of things. The rail system is also extremely usable to get around anywhere and ordering in food is a breeze as long as you meet the person downstairs. 

If my wife and I can have a blast with a 1 year old baby in tow you can have a blast too."

7161326,305041632,2018-08-10,189190457,David,"Wow! The photos suggested that the cottage was a bit unique but KEi and Susan have transformed the property into a spectacularly funky and fun get-away cottage. The modern details were fantastic from the custom lighting to the ""floating"" fireplace. We arrived to freshly cut herbs on the table and a chilled bottle of wine in the fridge. KEi's efforts in landscaping the small urban garden were obvious and I enjoyed chatting with him about everything from the unique fire pit to the espalier peach tree. Street parking was easy (KEi arranged for a parking permit). Downtown is a 45 minute walk or 15 minute streetcar ride away. The coffee shops pubs and eclectic stores of Queen Street are just around the corner. The location was quiet and convenient with wonderful hosts -- couldn't ask for more!"

There’s a great ramen shop quick mart and Tim hortons right down stairs. Close to everything downtown and had a parking spot. I would definitely stay there again.

1810146,441066937,2019-04-21,187904642,Denny,Clean and has everything you need. The unit has a manual with all the information you'll need. Chris remembered about me needing a parking permit and contacted me a few days before the stay to remind me. Great value and not too far from Toronto's main attractions.

31154405,474826297,2019-06-23,141786189,Stephanie,This house was exactly as the pictures shown in the listing. The location is pretty good for those who plan on driving. If you plan on using public transit to go to downtown Toronto you have to be ready for an hour transit at least. There are really good restaurants a few minutes walk from the house as well as some grocery stores. It was really easy to communicate with the host and she was really welcoming and nice. Although she does live in the house with us she won't disturb you if she sees that you are busy.

We live in Toronto and needed to get out of our place while we had some work done so we knew the area they live in which is fantastic. The basement apartment was exactly as expected based on the photos and Jonathan & Jenny made sure our check in was extremely easy. We would stay here again.

9826723,302355388,2018-08-05,194803324,Ljepa,Thank you for letting us stay here. We had a very lovely time and Ivy was a great host. She is very quick to reply and sent very detailed instructions for our arrival to the place. At first we were a bit nervous because the instructions sounded like a big mission but once we got there it was so simple it couldn’t have been simpler. The check in and check out were so easy too. The place was modern and super clean. The location could not have been better. We were steps away from restaurants spas tourist attractions nightclubs the lake etc etc etc. Thank you again Ivy for making our stay at your place memorable!

Communication  with Kenny was perfect.
If I ever will visit Toronto again I will certainly stay at Kenny's again.
Thank you!"
29080456,361011752,2018-12-22,62020447,Ryan,Great location with a clear view of the CN tower from both rooms. After driving into Toronto we were able to park our vehicle and walk or use transit to get everywhere. There are lots of good food options within walking distance and the number of restaurants available for skip the dishes and uber eats is very large. We were visiting Toronto over the holidays and the central location made meeting up with friends and family extremely convenient. The condo is a short walk from union station and the union Pearson express so travelling along major transit routes is easy. It's also close to the Skydome ACC and Ripley's aquarium so there are lots of activities withing walking distance. We look forward to booking this airbnb again in the future.
9937180,147016267,2017-04-24,107941814,Yocelin,I have been with Barbara for a month she is awesome her home has a great location! She provides everything you need! Trust me! Her food is delicious!!! Amaizing place to stay for a long time in Toronto!
18241160,187831211,2017-08-27,128941500,Tina,Located in the heart of Chinatown and a block away from the Art Gallery of Ontario the location couldn't be better. The house is on a quiet residential street just steps away from transit many restaurants pubs and coffee shops.  Amanda is a great host and very communicative. The bedroom is cute the bed is comfortable and the house is clean. I was there during a hot week in August and the house was kept very cool and comfortable. I'd recommend it to anyone and I hope to be back next summer. Thanks Amanda!

17240473,462902421,2019-06-02,258625001,Shelley,The location is in midtown as described in the ad. Lots of restaurants in the area and it’s close to the subway. The parking that was included with the rental was great given the cost of parking in the area. Paul was responsive to a problem with the garage door opener and addressed it quickly. The patio was nice to have but there was no patio furniture so we couldn’t enjoy a morning breakfast and coffee outside as there was no where to sit. It would have been nice to have a patio set available so we could use the very large patio. Unfortunately the building had an issue with the fire alarm system and the fire alarm went off both nights we were there. Not only was it annoying but it took the building awhile to turn it off. The temperature control in the building was also problematic. We had the AC turned on and couldn’t get the place cooler than 75’F. We had the windows open at night to try and cool the place but midtown is way too loud to leave them open all night. The place was clean but the quality of the furniture was poor. For the price of the rental I expected a more comfortable couch and dining room chairs with a working thermostat. There was a minimum number of towels provided which was annoying because we had to use the same towel for everything. It would have been nice to be able to use 1 towel for my hair plus one for my body and 2 for my boyfriend. Also would have been nice to have a couple of hand towels available as he only had 2 face towels which weren’t enough for hand drying and washing. There was no dish towels provided either so I had to use paper towels to dry dishes which isn’t ideal when trying to dry dishes. Personally I won’t be staying at this location again when I stay in TO as the price doesn’t reflect the space and what is offered which is unfortunate because the location was what I was looking for.
1009751,82776549,2016-06-29,67550571,Dan,"Great Location. Access was simple Nice clean place and the bed was very comfy. I only stayed for one night but would definitely stay again. No complaints.

65238,262637967,2018-05-09,1563967,Jason,It fast and easy getting from the airport to Magali's place and the check-in was also effortless. Magali & family were very friendly and helpful during my stay. My room offered privacy plenty of space for my needs and was comfortable. The neighbourhood was quiet so I was able to sleep with my window open which was nice. The location is perfect being close to the subway good restaurants and coffee shops and all the conveniences. I'm very satisfied with deciding to stay here during my stay in Toronto and would recommend.

23310396,257808924,2018-04-27,168919732,Barbara,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this modern bright apartment. The downtown cityscape view was stunning. Checking in  ( which we were able to do early) was easy. Our group of two couples found the accommodation and the location to be perfect for a few days getaway. We were close to the subway Via train attractions and shows. Carl was most helpful in advising us on good eats in TO.

The neighborhood is a great location. I am typically the type that wants the ""entire place"" type of listings but this was still very private and we felt very comfortable! You can tell that Kenny truly cares about his guest's experience and he is extremely accommodating. I would definitely stay here again."

It is so well decorated and well located. It's in front of the waterfront which is simply beautiful and since it's a touristic area you have restaurants coffee shops groceries liquor store at a walking distance. 

My colleague and I rented the apartment because we were attending the RGD Design Thinking conference which was held a the Meridian Hall (formerly Sony Centre for the Performing Arts) which was only a 15 minute walking walk.

The place was very well decorated had a lot of amenities and most of all very well secured. 

I didn't get the meet the hosts but they were both very quick to answer whenever I had a question or concern. I would rent this place again in a heart beat!"

Parking was a bit confusing due to the fact that there was no designated parking spot and you had to pay quite a bit for parking. 
Other than that we had a great stay!"
14471456,565638133,2019-11-17,1772098,Caroline,What a great gem! SO so so cozy which was perfect on the freezing weekend we were in Toronto. That bed is one of the comfiest I’ve ever slept in. Wifi was a bit spotty but LP was always very quick to answer. Even though we didn’t meet LP the stay felt very personal full of local recommendations which was great. If you’re doubting whether to rent: do it!

I must have taken 100s of pictures from there. The location is also great: within walking distance from Union station distillery district and waterfront. I will definitely stay at Eric's place if I visit Toronto again.

A few setbacks with the wifi but hopefully Nicholas fixes the problem for the next guests. Make sure to bring your own cleaning necessities because there was not much to clean with. This place is good for short time frames and myself as well as my friends would stay here again!

18102268,310614447,2018-08-19,199556307,Daniel,I had check in issues (had to wait an hour to get in) and issues with getting into the building in the middle of the night because the fob wouldn't work. Room is very basic but works. For the huge amount of the cleaning fee I expected much cleaner premises but it wasn't dirty. However Saad and his flatmate were friendly and especially with the great location I would still recommend. I'm sure these issues will be rectified for future guests. Convenient parking garage on site too!

There is an amazing deck cozy beds fully equipped kitchen gorgeous bathroom huge soaking tub with rain shower fluffy towels laundry facilities. Gail answered all of our questions up front and responded immediately when we contacted her AND was super sweet and friendly. She knew we were in Toronto for a family wedding and left us some champagne in the fridge. Even asked if we took our coffee with cream and made sure there was some in the fridge. It was a really wonderful experience all around. We used Uber all over town checking out the huge selection of restaurants. Gail’s place was the perfect retreat from the hustle & bustle of the city. It is stylish and comfortable and very much a home away from home. Gail herself could not have been nicer.
Five Stars !⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

3517167,305049974,2018-08-10,194721316,Toby,"Nice view and nice location.  Husain and Tom are nice to chat and to talk to. But i didn’t like the fact  that there are other Airbnb guests too without knowing about each other. The booking only says  the host and you but in fact  there is the host (which was on holiday) and other Airbnb guests which we don’t know and don’t know how they behave. Also the booking does not say “shared bathroom”.  Our “room”  was a couch in the living room which the pictures don’t show properly but the text says it somehow-> our fault 
As we arrived we didn’t even know where to sleep to who the other luggage belonged when we came in. It was super dirty the kitchen was full with used stuff   towels on the floor in the bathroom... -> the other guests had an other understanding from “clean” so we started cleaning the kitchen and were washing towels 
After they left i would have expected that someone is coming to clean the apartment (that’s the cleaning fee you pay for Airbnb) but in fact only one guy checked the room didn’t even change the sheets for the new guests no clean towels the used ones just were left on the floor
I’m sad to say that this was the worst Airbnb experience I’ve made so far  even if the view was really nice"
25191055,515144944,2019-08-22,185567890,Christopher,"Excellent location so close to Union station CN tower Rogers place Scotiabank centre! Incredible view from the balcony.
Great hostess!"

Je recommande ce logement."
21147043,267431536,2018-05-21,127958409,Sophia,Exactly as shown in pictures; very clean and spacious! The location is walking distance from so many amazing restaurants bars and clubs. Philip was very easy to get in contact with always responded quickly and kept in touch throughout our stay.
12064625,88113940,2016-07-23,6987758,Baha,"Maged's apartment was absolutely gorgeous. Very tastefully furnished and with quite possibly the best view in Toronto that I've seen. It was exactly as advertised clean and perfectly located. Maged was also the perfect host. Very prompt and professional in communication and struck the perfect balance between giving me privacy while making himself available in case I needed him. He was also very kind in allowing me to checkout late on last minute notice when I urgently needed to open up my laptop and connect in to work.

I highly recommend this listing!"
21382275,448888161,2019-05-05,245643301,Mina,The space is small but has everything you need. And the hosts are super nice! Also the location is great. I highly recommend it :)

31591821,421441724,2019-03-09,29402178,William,Very easy access to Downtown (about 5 min walk to Chinatown 10 min streetcar to the Eaton Centre) and there were many restaurants and shops around the building.

4708992,122152097,2016-12-21,106096812,Momotaz,This apartment is ideally located for those wishing to explore downtown on foot and via public transport. There was an excellent parking garage underneath the apartment to stash your vehicle and not have to worry about it (entirely safe and protected from the weather) for the duration of your stay.  You will not find a better deal that includes an excellent location free parking and a friendly host. The room was fine bed was comfortable and clean. It did get a little cold at night but the blankets were more than sufficient and it made for excellent sleeping temperature both I and my boyfriend (a lite sleeper) were out like a light.  Raghu was an excellent host extremely friendly and accommodating.
27613500,405201022,2019-01-26,20739323,Karla,Great location positive communication comfortable beds ample space open concept kitchen/dining/living area lots of natural light with many large windows beautiful fireplace and modern design.  Please note: This town house consists of two rental units. There is NO DOOR between the upper rental unit and the lower rental unit; just an open staircase (one going up and one going down) off the foyer from the main entrance (used by both units).  Meaning: either tenant has access to the others rental unit at any time.  Each tenant is clearly instructed to not go into the other's prospective rental unit (basically the Honor system) but in all reality there is literally nothing stopping either tenant from walking into the other's rental space.  As three women traveling outside the U.S. this was disturbing/unsettling to say the least. Our host was very understanding and apologetic as we shared our concerns.  We suggested that installing locks on each of the bedroom doors would be a good first step in helping future renters feel more secure.  If we had known there was no door between us and the lower unit we would not have rented this property.  It's important to note that I believe our host is a good man who desires that his guests have a positive experience.  I don't think it was his intention to provide misinformation in any way.
26263852,356274697,2018-12-07,48043943,Shona,Excellent apartment with all the necessary amenities and very helpful!
27368966,364914261,2018-12-31,210570671,Maíra,"Easy and simple check-in and everything very clean! 
Great place for York University and Seneca@York students.
Thank you"
15112971,492613049,2019-07-21,123290190,Irene,We spent the hottest weekend of the summer here for our son's wedding. Our accommodations were the perfect place to relax and keep cool.  Everything that we needed was on-hand in this comfortable and clean unit. I would highly recommend spending your time here.
1009751,142961491,2017-04-09,95731724,Siyue,Ron is very nice person 
3684349,436732991,2019-04-13,255095047,Tani,The apartment is not nearly as luxurious as the pictures. The appliances were old and rusty the couch was deteriorating. There was a large hole in one the bedroom walls. The corners and in between places of the bathroom were dirty. If you are looking for an exceptional experience this is not the place. But if you are looking for somewhere to lay your head it will suffice.
9129567,278093748,2018-06-17,181280314,Jennie,Kathleen really is a super host. What a wonderful stay and a great location

29659038,460932889,2019-05-30,14883924,Justin,This is a great place to stay at and I took advantage of the building amenities which were great. The location of this unit is in the heart of downtown close to everything you need or want.  Also Ben was very quick to respond to any of the questions I had. I strongly recommend this place if you plan to be in Toronto a couple days.  Will for sure stay here again.
15644539,147551461,2017-04-27,8005106,Gillie,My family and I absolutely LOVED staying at Ruth's house!  She was a lovely host perfectly attentive and always able to communicate with.  The unit itself was more than comfortable with all the ammenities one could ever need.  We really felt spoiled staying here and will moat definitely be back in the near future.

14806985,174026447,2017-07-24,3389769,Chris,Close to Eaton Centre roughly 3 blocks from the subway within 20 min by foot to everything downtown. Huge bathroom clean kitchen and living room. Bed was just right!
5666775,53999881,2015-11-15,1283998,Ana,The place is exactly as pictured clear communication with Tammy with good advise on where to get some dinner in the area. Neighborhood is very residential quiet and nice. We ended up coming without a car there was a frequent bus going to York Mills Station and you could catch the TTC from there to go downtown etc.
1646214,90623614,2016-08-01,51574119,Vladimir,Great Location. Didn't need to contact host because everything was provided. Bars restaurants and grocery store all walking distances away.  Anju made me and my friend fell very welcomed.
20902086,349455320,2018-11-17,75959483,Binney,Good location but not the best place to stay on a cold night. Heating provided by space heater. Door is also tricky to open. Good location but missing some essential touches to justify the price.
37055198,530121906,2019-09-15,179366343,Paul,Very nice space was perfect for our overnight trip in Toronto.

9975236,264262885,2018-05-13,61570269,Haley,Great view in a very convenient location! Check-in was really simple and Jason is easy to communicate with. However we found the mattress to be extremely firm as previous guests have stated. But if you're able to get past the bed it is a lovely place to stay.
9867972,421059967,2019-03-08,89506338,John,Really enjoyed having full Bell tv/internet and all the movie and sports channels. First time getting that perk in the area!
12523798,474918315,2019-06-23,176822186,Ashly,"Great place to stay in the heart of Toronto with a fantastic view. Host was easy to communicate with and fast at answering any questions we had.

It was very roomy for what we needed and modern and nice. We would recommend

20990627,435122235,2019-04-09,32142593,Jason,Jamil is a great host who is located in the heart of CityPlace with outstanding 47th-floor views of downtown. Clear views of the CN Tower from the balcony. Towels were fresh the apartment is very clean and the location is about a 10-minute walk away from major tourist sites such as the CN Tower and the Toronto Aquarium. The condo only has two elevators so sometimes there can be a backlog of residents trying to get upstairs. So be aware that it might take 10 minutes to get from the lobby to the 47th floor during peak hours (6-7pm).
228568,111245342,2016-10-30,9317839,William,Rob's place was better than expected and we had high expectations. We stayed in and drank wine and took in the view one night because it was that great of a place. When we wanted to go out to the gayborhood it was just around the corner. Great place. Highly recommend it.
35619880,547114941,2019-10-14,267031180,Gagan,not satisfied enough
13299867,163106386,2017-06-23,133990494,Ashley,Great view! Nice place for a getaway while being close enough to Toronto's attractions. The pool and hot tub was a bonus too! Place was clean and cozy and the communitcation between the host and us was beyond expectation. Felt very welcome!
21755182,499541598,2019-07-31,77602494,Kristine,Stylish modern space in a great location downtown Toronto. Its more of a studio than a one bedroom space but has a great well equipped kitchen and some nice amenities.
24351707,281746928,2018-06-25,148599914,Grace,The stay is incredibly worth it :) Just keep in mind owners or any other visitors are sharing certain spaces outside of room. But they are very hospitable.

16425784,176699892,2017-07-31,121108940,Melissa,The apartment is in a great location. We were actually walking distance from the CN tower and a 5 minute ride from the ROM. It was very spacious even though there were six of us. 
11359841,287057907,2018-07-07,154903077,Heather,Great value and location VERY clean felt like a hotel. Only minor down side was the floors were thin we didn't mind the noise from above but made us self conscious of how loud we were! Would book again for sure!
1382277,35251048,2015-06-16,4521941,Jess,"What a lovely place. A really good conversion of an old building into lofts and this one is very well done with a good mix of concrete floors and exposed pipework with interesting art cosy and comfortable furniture and a very welcome balcony. It's a great location a minute's walk from Queen Street East which is a great neighbourhood and gives access to the whole city with frequent street cars. 

Cristina was very pleasant and helpful everything worked well and we had a great time. "
35418981,512760299,2019-08-18,164872584,Tammy,Highly recommend Vivian’s place. Location was ideal for any concert at the Budweiser stage. Clean comfortable and loved sitting outside on the deck in the backyard.

4058460,68711180,2016-04-06,41573796,Nikhil,Alex is really a very nice host. We were new to Toronto and Alex really helped us a lot. Right from the day we checked in Alex ensured that we are as comfortable as possible. Great locality and a good neighbourhood. Appt was exactly as it was shown in the pic. Would definitely recommend this property and host to everyone. Thanks Alex
38492825,571937734,2019-12-01,86943027,Cindy,The area is quiet and the house has such nice furniture and spacing. I recommend it if you are going with a lot of people!
20474413,562260756,2019-11-10,108726898,Robin,"Lucy's house is nothing less than amazing. Her place looks exactly like her pictures d.  Her home is cozy clean and it gives you that home away from home feeling. The neighborhood is a quiet residential / family oriented neighborhood close to varies food options and public transportation.  If you decide to drive there is an additional fee to park on her property as street parking is extremely limited. Please ensure that when booking your airbnb that you mention the correct number of people that will stay because there is a fee for additional people.  You can hear the subway  train going by but its kind of faint and doesn't  run as often at night.  Overall I will diffidently stay here again.  
Thank you Lucy"
13769161,291820950,2018-07-16,198683304,Rosa,Great location! Easy access to metro great restaurants comfortable space for two friends. Morning coffee is always always a wonderful add-on - thank you! Never met the dog although we sort of hoped he would wander in.

16910591,428074124,2019-03-24,249109989,Brock,Place was clean. Amazing location just steps away from all the fun Downtown Toronto has to offer. Host was very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommend. Would absolutely stay again.

The appartament is special. If you plan to come to Toronto it's a MUST! Bezad is a great host too: fast informations and very kind!
32166199,479850215,2019-07-01,73252756,Aaditya,"It's a perfect place for staying right in the heart of the city. So close to subway and bus stop just outside the building. Grocery store on the building premises itself makes it very easy to shop. The place is superb and has a fantastic view also so clean and sparkling. 
Bhoomi is a great host so polite and helpful. One can feel right at home. Loved staying here. Totally worth it."
14771353,406963737,2019-01-31,191843023,Ashley,"My husband and I had a fantastic stay at Sherry’s place! We stayed for 2 months and would happily stay again. Sherry and Judy were always available for any issues and quickly had them sorted out. Their place is 3 minutes to the bus stop which is awesome and also 5 minutes from a little park which was great for our dog. Everything is pretty much within walking distance. The place is a good comfortable size and very neat and modern. There is also a tv and couch you can’t see from the pictures.  
I would happily recommend their place!"

19904208,237598201,2018-02-23,26116311,Deirdre,Kelly's home in High Park was perfect for our family of six adults for our weeks trip to Toronto. It's in a very nice residential neighbourhood  close to cafes restaurants  supermarkets and yet just five mins walk to the High Park subway stop with bus stops also nearby. Kelly is very helpful and always available when needed. We loved the large spacious kitchen living area which was ideal for our group of six adults. A great location for exploring the city of Toronto.
29280781,561474079,2019-11-09,192187561,Samuel,Karen was a great host! She answered all my questions quickly and effectively. The room was also nice.
16193856,329778514,2018-09-29,67651478,Deanne,My boyfriend and I stayed at Georgies for one night for an event nearby. It was as described the bed was incredibly comfortable (those were my favorite pillows I've ever slept on!) her place is in a prime location with so many great shops and restaurants nearby. If you don't want to walk to the farther parts of Toronto the street car is close by giving you access to all the things you might be looking for during your stay! Although we kept to ourselves most of the time Georgie was very warm and welcoming. Check in was easy. Great for travellers couples families who want to check out Toronto without too much craziness. Highly highly recommended!
13634984,222026600,2017-12-28,160777058,Marie-Claude,We had a great time! We felt that Liz was really taking good care of us. She was right there if we needed anything. Her condo ia beautiful very modern and cosy.

27550586,545088106,2019-10-11,163371658,Guojun,Huan is an excellent host. The place is clean and tidy.
34151837,496593592,2019-07-27,252212030,Joe,"I stayed here for two nights in July 2019 while visiting Toronto.  The location was perfect for a first time visit to the area near the waterfront and Marina area not too far from great nightlife markets and shopping all within walking distance.  There are also city bikes you can rent if you want to peddle around a little faster than by foot with dedicated space for bikes in some areas.  Traffic in this city is busy during prime travel hours so being in a centralized spot with easy commute options and public transit easily available - was very convenient.  

I arrived later in the evening around 8:30pm and a woman named Lori was there to meet me near the parking entrance.  She was kind enough to escort me inside the parking area and show me straight to the parking spot.  I unloaded my bag and she walked with me up to the building elevators and up to the condo. 

The inside is very clean modern and simple - which I really enjoyed.  No clutter or gaudy decorations.  It was clean bright and spacious.  There was a nice living area with a great view of the city a spare room with a sleeper sofa also with a great view out the windows.  The guest bath between the master bedroom and guest room was also very nice.  Inside the master bedroom is a comfortable bed again with a great view of the city.  The connected master bathroom was very modern and clean.  The building itself is fairly new so it had nice little touches like a built in exhaust fan timer switch for the bathroom and electrical outlets placed conveniently around the space.  

I made use of the WiFi while I was there and had no issues with connectivity.  There are 3 TV sets total in the space.  Kitchen area with all the typical options if you want to cook for yourself a freezer/refrigerator table for 4 and pretty much anything you’d need for a nice stay both long and short.  

I am so glad I didn’t stay at a normal hotel in the area and was able to enjoy this beautiful condo.  I don’t think I could have asked for any better place to stay in the city and would highly recommend this as an option to anyone visiting the area.  

I did not make use of or get access to the building emeritus such as the exercise room pool/hot-tub etc.  If you are banking on those amenities I would recommend asking the host about that to confirm before making your plans."
8540189,515879878,2019-08-23,120439792,Isaac,Great place and location!  Communication with the host was always very easy and quick would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in town!
17697305,156451555,2017-05-30,112802789,XueYong,"The House room is great for the Value This is the master room biggest in the house. has very big window bright. Internet is great very fast for any business trip I can working at home. 
The whole unit is clean the washroom is new renovated months ago. The wash room has 2 sinks which good for the couple wash together.
There is very big living room with dining room.
Also the balcony is very good. it's the best balcony on this street.
The Host is strictly the smoking people I am happy with this since I am very sensitive and hate the cigarette smell.
The location is very convenience only takes 17 min. to the city Center. or 35 min. to Downtown Toronto core.
It is very easy to communicate with the host. Easy going knowledgeable like to answer any questions.
Thank you."

مكان رائع بكل تفاصيله : الاطلالة ، النضافة ، الموقع"
7999412,264768465,2018-05-14,42083114,Thomas,"Four of us stayed at Navid's place for Canada Music Week and it was the perfect location.  We were able to walk to most of the music venues and restaurants we wanted to check out and discovered lots of new great places right in the neighborhood.  The place looks as advertised and Nav was quick and accommodating in communication.  Would happily stay here again.
Thanks Nav!"

4922566,84913056,2016-07-09,37865420,Nicolas,schönes und gemütliches Haus. Am besten gefallen hat mir die Lage (Nähe zu distillery district und gut erreichbares Stadtzentrum; das Viertel an sich war nicht das beste der Stadt). Sehr gemütliches und modernes Wohnzimmer. Die Schlafzimmer sind nicht so gemütlich. Man wird es mögen wenn man Hostelatmosphäre mag; man wird es nicht mögen wenn man keine Hostelatmosphäre mag. Ich war in einem kleinen Zimmer im Keller mit drei weiteren Personen. Im oberen Stockwerk waren weitere Personen und die Familie. Die anderen Gäste waren extrem freundlich; weiß nicht ob das einfach Glück war oder ein gutes Händchen von Elaine & Greg

25966573,425982117,2019-03-19,14196226,Allison,Stephanie's was wonderful! The apartment was such a cool space plus very clean and calm. Check-in and communication were all really easy and the location was great and easily accessible to public transportation. I also loved their three adorable cats. I would definitely stay here again!

31497877,414036973,2019-02-18,177445391,Pauline,Jessica’s place was amazing! It’s in a nice area that’s a close drive to downtown Toronto and right next to public transportation. It was super clean and perfect for our little getaway from the city. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!
13436990,181937266,2017-08-13,25802277,Jim,Beautiful apartment in the perfect location to walk to many nearby neighborhoods. Host was amazing and had perfect recommendations.
16323704,161827326,2017-06-18,59645286,Hadare,This was my first experience staying in a private room. Typically I've booked whole condos or houses.  After this wonderful experience with Rush and his partner I will be much more open to booking a private room. It was clean convenient quiet and so welcoming. Also possibly the most comfortable bed and pillows I've ever slept on. Rush was always there when we needed him. The house is actually just like the photos and all the reviews were accurate. This is definitely where I will be staying any time I'm in Toronto! Oh and he also had great recommendations if you're new to the area. 
6385103,557649904,2019-11-01,13254735,Hj,Very responsive caring. Thank you!

12406747,273574799,2018-06-06,192069241,Bryce,The place was beautiful and in a great location. Host was easy to work with and the place was well stocked. The only negative I would say is that the cleaning of the place seemed like a rush job but otherwise top shelf Airbnb.
22016721,296325787,2018-07-25,202853274,Brenda,Very clean and neat home. Levee was friendly and anxious to make our stay comfortable. 
16374420,219485154,2017-12-17,39859776,Angela,The location of this place is great! The place looks exactly as the pictures. We had everything we needed and Malik answered any inquiries super quickly! Would definitely recommend staying here!

Highly recommend it."
13864717,87076676,2016-07-18,75793559,Marwan,We enjoyed our stay at Vince and Anna's place. We felt at home and welcomed. The place is newly renovated and is in a great condition.
8206016,458817855,2019-05-26,262676818,Cheryl,Shirleys place was amazing! So clean huge space huge room and Shirley answered all questions instantly! She was the perfect host. Even offered to drive us around instead of having to use Uber. Her other quests were helpful and kind as well. Our plans fell through on the last day and we would have been waiting for a ride home at the local mall for hours but we asked Shirley if we could stay a few hours past our check out time and she arranged it :) We will definitely stay again if ever back in Toronto! Thank you so much Shirley for everything
19718705,196586586,2017-09-23,12095753,Vicente,Brent's place is perfect to explore Toronto. Well located close to all main city attractions (CN Tower Ripley's Aquarium). The place itself is gorgeous 5/5 cleaning it has a parking spot (wich saved us some money and helped a lot). Communication was easy and even despite a late check-in (we arrived pretty late night) Brent was able to help us to get in easily. Strongly recommended.
17388045,272428748,2018-06-03,142652046,Aymen,I live in Ottawa so i travel to Toronto a-lot. This was hands down the best place I’ve stayed in. The place was bigger than I thought it would be. Enough room for everybody. It was very nice very clean and had a great view. It was in a great location as well as I found myself walking to most places. It had a pool and a gym as-well. I would definitely recommend this place for sure.
18489228,367756318,2019-01-05,22422412,John,Will go again. Great value.

2888365,46645956,2015-09-12,5855199,Barbara,Now back at home my husband and I still think fondly of your cool and cozy place which was our haven of comfort for a week of visit in Toronto to see our son.  Sparkling clean fully furnished and ideally located your place  was truly a home away from home.
31209947,467561888,2019-06-10,14700959,Joe,Fred’s place was a great stay we were able to make use of the kitchenette multiple times and it had everything we needed.
9807916,329779541,2018-09-29,119917369,Minhye,It was clean and neat. I could use the whole basement and felt really private. Roxy was very helpful and tried her best to satisfy me.

Thank you Ann-Marie!"
5669029,45607871,2015-09-04,42138864,Lee,我和家人到多倫多旅行非常高興能夠住進 Janvier Nguyen的房子｡房子和照片上的差距不大很漂亮､溫馨使用的器具(如:廚具､餐具)都很有質感空間也夠大讓小孩子們和我們大人都住得很開心｡我們也很喜歡附近社區距離市區不遠甚至於可以步行(約20分鐘)到海灘區這個社區的房子也都很漂亮很清幽蠻乾淨的｡謝謝~~~~
28316485,475633374,2019-06-24,11525753,Richard,Spencer's place was good. He was a solid host with had very good communication. The value was great and the location was not bad. However I didn't get the impression that the apartment was newly renovated. Was older and a bit grungier than I expected. As I indicated to Spencer the bathroom could use some TLC a new shower curtain and real bath towels for starters. And the temperature of the shower was tricky. It would switch from scolding hot to ice cold randomly.  If you're looking for a no frills affordable place to stay in Toronto I recommend Spencer's place.
25482279,444928251,2019-04-28,100426757,Erika,It was a great experience. Place is at the perfect spot of the city.
11508705,125964996,2017-01-08,39874549,Elena,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay at Mary's. Friendly and welcoming folks. We felt like we were in a beautiful charming cabin in the middle of the west end. Very private steps away from fantastic restaurants and shops. Close to public transit very accommodating. 

We will definitely be visiting Mary and James again. High Park is also close by. We also heard no city traffic from where we were staying :) So lovely.

Thanks again

17893194,148922616,2017-05-01,124615254,Damian,The room was lovely and clean.  The location was fantastic with great shops and restaurants within walking distance PLUS a bus stop on the corner that connects you to the subway or a street car that takes you straight into the city center.  The private bathroom was nice and the shower was fantastic.  The host/s respected privacy but were on hand to help with any inquiries.  All in all fantastic room for great value will book again if I'm ever in the city.
20990627,321075046,2018-09-09,161833834,Kathy,Jamil was a super hospitable welcoming friendly helpful and reactive host. Had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend. Everything went well from booking to check-in and checkout. Thank you so much Jamil !
21393887,329306440,2018-09-28,82092021,Pauline,The place is exactly as presented.  Very spacious and the beds are amazingly comfortable.  Amazing to have this much room right downtown...with 3  bedrooms too!  The hosts were very quick and receptive to inquiries and questions.  Would highly reccommend this place if looking for a spot downtown.  Easy walking distance to Rigers Centre and restaurants even for my father who uses a cane.  Sobeys grocery store just one block away which was extremely convenient!
26339187,403245126,2019-01-20,231861813,Nicole,Great space and great location :) Friendly hosts!
14874815,130805209,2017-02-08,44499158,Joseph,Had a great quiet stay. Was out most of the time but David's place had everything I needed; cozy bed ample space clean bathroom and central location. It was perfect for myself but maybe people 5'9 and over my find the bathroom ceiling short. Oh and the check in instructions were detailed and easy to understand. I would stay there again. Thanks David!
6504852,46066241,2015-09-07,26672336,David,Marie's loft was as every says exactly the way it's pictured. Toronto was in a heat wave when we visited and Marie had the fans going air conditioners on high and we were quite comfortable for the night. Marie was very flexible with arrival and departure times and was able to meet us to let us in and show us around. The loft is very clean beautifully decorated lots of books to read or leaf through and the bathroom and kitchen were ready for use. We particularly enjoyed the piano!
23321474,450880992,2019-05-10,156241076,Graham,This is our second stay at Elaine's and it didn't disappoint. They have done an absolutely wonderful job making this space welcoming cozy and comfy. So many nice touches added to make guests feel welcome. We will make a point of seeing if Elaine's is available every time we find ourselves going to Toronto

18813231,194800697,2017-09-17,149336166,Katherine,I would give more than 5 stars if I could! I didn't meet Reggie and Irene but I didn't need to. Not only were they awesome and available for communication when necessary.. but check-in check-out parking and anything else I needed were all clearly at my disposal and I loved the flexibility/independence! Definitely worth the price and bringing my pup was an awesome bonus. Thanks Reggie & Irene!!
13876498,99108241,2016-09-03,89451171,Anirudh,Dene she is an excellent host. We had great conversations and we felt very comfortable at her place. The apartment is clean welcoming and the view of the city is phenomenal. I would love to stay here again when i visit Toronto. 
28203901,350201465,2018-11-18,13056891,Susan,Impeccably clean large well-appointed and cute two bedroom- beautiful modern Portuguese tiles in the kitchen area are a beautiful touch. Extremely quiet. Entrance around the back of the house...the unit itself has been recently renovated and is very modern.  Two very comfortable bedrooms lovely modern bathroom with good shower. Unit is on Bathurst St. near the restaurants and bars of College St Little Portugal /Italy  Kensington Market. Walking distance to subway. You can buy a very reasonable street parking permit from City of Toronto online for the area.  Checkin super easy and great communication with friendly and helpful hosts much appreciated.

8988016,305022661,2018-08-10,40152733,Katharine,What a great location. It's a super safe neighborhood to walk around in and all of the restaurants we tried were amazing. Su-Ying was super responsive when we had any questions and gave us a huge list of recommendations on things to do and where to dine. 
20965914,293628710,2018-07-20,29567627,Hila,Best airbnb ever! I had a wonderful stay. Penny was the nicest and most generous host. The place had everything I needed plus things I bever expected like food in my fridge soaps and shampoos hairdryer and Netflix. Penny's place is gorgeous and the lication is perfect. I was bragging to everyone about this perfect place.

1382277,75595649,2016-05-22,62100735,Mike,Cristina was awesome and her place was a perfect way to experience a great neighborhood outside of the typical downtown Financial district hotel.  From making restaurant recommendations to being flexible and easy to work with Cristina is a great host. Her place is very nice but would be tight with more than 2 people. The neighborhood was great and walking distance to the distillery district and good bars and restaurants but would not be ideal if spending your trip on the other side of town.  
15770518,468028624,2019-06-11,171727270,Zach,Great location and lots of sleeping options. Highly recommend this place.
28161619,503764611,2019-08-06,108272656,Rob,Fantastic location if you only have a short time to see Toronto and an amazing view from the balcony.  The check in was easy and Jordan responded quickly to the queries we had.  Whilst the property was clean it was disappointing to find the dishwasher full of dirty dishes from the previous occupant.
13322381,187230120,2017-08-26,146594566,Rohan,Clean and a very good house. Mary Anne Is very friendly and helpful.

Besides being a great host the location of the suite was perfect.  Highly recommend."
7107331,150235745,2017-05-07,92631438,Rose,"We booked Kris' home as our ""Toronto Home Base"" for our daughter's wedding and it was wonderful.  The character of the home was a perfect backdrop for ""getting ready photos"" and provided a wonderful home environment to host visiting family and friends.  It was well equipped with all that was needed and clean and comfortable.  It met all expectations and matched the photos and descriptions.  Thanks again Kris for making your lovely home available for us to book for this very special occasion!"
18998698,177079752,2017-08-01,54700499,Asu,The location is perfect. Clean.
25031038,338093966,2018-10-18,65981034,Greg,This place was just as the add advertises. It's cozy but great for 1 or 2 people. It's also in a great location in China Town  3 min from Kensington market.
2478644,22978387,2014-11-19,19887545,Sharon,Natalie and Michael are charming low-key hosts.  We stayed with our adult daughter in the second room.  Comfortable beds.  Great quiet neighborhood.  Breakfast is modest and healthy.  We loved the organic yogurt and barely sweetened granola.  Seriously good coffee on offer (you make yourself).  Arrangement totally worked for us.  Don't be intimidated by the stairs (unless you have balance or mobility issues in which case perhaps better not to risk it.)  We'd stay again in a heartbeat.
23309267,443261156,2019-04-25,48354361,Maria Rita,The basement is comfy and perfect. All the amenities included. The locations is a few blocks away from bus stop and supermarket. Very calm neighbourhood. And Chris was always ready to help!
39202241,564694239,2019-11-16,206056250,Mickael,Perfect better than what I excepted ! Room clean perfect for the low price proposed. Good area in downtown and close from the tramway !
28134682,321564432,2018-09-10,27971514,David,Jacob was very accommodating and responsive to messages. The location was perfect for us as well we would look to stay here again when we return to Toronto.
20014290,289528286,2018-07-12,78856105,Karen,Great Location!!!! Nikki was a very professional host. Would highly recommend.
75051,2135987,2012-08-29,1772049,Teresa,"What a beautiful peaceful experience here!  We really enjoyed having a ""home away from home""  Sandra was available if needed up to leaving fresh cream for us!  From having coffee in the morning to a nice glass of wine in the evening on the serene patio we could not of asked for more!  If you are looking for late nights partying and the hustle & bustle of the BIG city don't look here and I am saying that in a GOOD way.  But.  If you want to be surrounded by architecture authenticity and a great local experience this is your place!  Thank you Sandra  we loved staying here and will come back here if ever in Toronto again :)  No Complaints and wonderful memories."
21457785,338798409,2018-10-20,207226186,Karn,spent couple of weeks here. it was a comfortable stay. Hamilton is a good host. he was also flexible with an early checkout. place is clean. kitchen is equipped. place is convenient for subway usage. would come here for future stays as well.
24995558,404332705,2019-01-23,112270228,Luis Alberto,Location was perfect place is a bit small but comfortable and welcoming. There is an ultra HD tv with Netflix and more apps. Only problem is that the fire alarm if he building went on twice at 4 am because of “technical problems” so it was a bit of a setup obviously not the host fault but still something that might be ongoing for a while. Check in and check out was easy overall and for the price I would recommend it specially for its location right in Yorkville.
20292789,458832363,2019-05-26,135714427,Alice,Great location and parking is available right in the driveway. Very clean home and friendly host!
20458205,522691665,2019-09-02,209322779,Isaiah,Wonderful place! Great host!!! Would highly recommend! Not too far from downtown about a 30 mins drive on the motorway.

The house and the rooms are in an incredible condition and are very organized and tidy. I had a connecting flight so the fact that the house is very close to the airport is very convenient. The house is also very close to a bus stop. 
I highly recommend Erika and her family.
Thank you again!"

6728860,540445333,2019-10-03,45385376,Calum,Our room was lovely bigger than expected very clean and had everything we needed. The location is perfect just off Queen West in a really cool neighbourhood and less than 30 mins streetcar ride to anywhere we wanted to go. Holly was very welcoming when we arrived. I’d recommend her place to anyone travelling to Toronto.

26472655,317761887,2018-09-02,125257705,Sophie,Very spacious and clean condo right in the heart of Toronto. We went to the Metro Convention Centre for the weekend and this was perfect! You have a Tim Horton attach to the building lots of parking space (but very pricy it's Toronto for you) and a small grocery store just across the street. I highly recommend this Airbnb.
13064101,276049767,2018-06-12,110068962,Luke,Ben’s place could not be in a better location! You are just steps away from the hip and popular Queen Street which has all the cafes bars and shopping you could ask for. Transit is also readily available to easily get you to places like Rogers Center to catch a Jays game. If you wish to enjoy a night in the living room has a wonderful TV to and comfy sofa. Or if you need to get away from the warm weather retreat to the bedroom and turn on the robust A/C unit to have a cool down. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting the city.
20845166,339388369,2018-10-21,139065319,Isaac,"O espaço é bom MAS;
Precisamos deixar as malas na casa do anfitrião antes do horário do check-in enviamos mensagem no dia anterior ele não respondeu e apesar de ter recebido as malas.
Foi muito grosseiro e desnecessário em seu tratamento conosco gritou conosco. 
Por isso não gostamos e consequentemente não nos sentimos nada a vontade.
Observação: apesar de estar descrito para o quarto que ficamos considere subir mais de 30 degraus."
390395,234411673,2018-02-12,115175476,Jodi,Sean truly IS a superhost. He was incredibly welcoming and made our stay feel truly comfortable. It was like staying with a friend. The cats were ridiculous sweet. Any questions he was happy to answer as well as provided a clean space with anything you could possibly need or may have forgotten. Highly recommended.

24167253,503261480,2019-08-05,34694605,Dominique,Look nowhere else everyone.... THIS PLACE IS IT!! The location is bomb & the condo was beautiful! The place was very clean as well which I appreciated. AND THAT BALCONY was beyond everything I wanted!!!!!! We were in town for a bachelorette party and  Caribana & OVO Fest was going on. This condo was perfectly located to take public transit if we wanted or Uber of course. There are many restaurants & stores within walking distance.  6 women all slept very comfortably. I would absolutely stay here any time I'm visiting Toronto.
18457960,158179197,2017-06-05,131822769,Umar,Very nice and clean place Hamid and his wife are very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our stay at their place

2267889,37453858,2015-07-07,22891865,Jodi,"We arrived at Genevieve's wonderful and spacious place to find delicious bread and wine out for us (as well as popsicles the kids later discovered in the freezer).  What a great welcome!  We immediately flipped open the binder on the table to find helpful maps of the area and useful info about busses and subways.  Genevieve and her husband were happy to answer any questions that came up during our stay.  

The two bedroom was a perfect space for us and our three kids.  Hearing the odd pitter-patter of little feet upstairs made us feel at home and relaxed knowing a little bit of ruckus on our part was bound to be forgiven."
5629790,182472731,2017-08-14,136333784,Max,Max was a very caring and helpful host. We enjoyed our stay at his place a lot and totally recommend him.

7770469,339485447,2018-10-21,205015366,Wanda,"The apartment is very clean and spacious and had everything I needed for my stay.   The location is fantastic and almost everything is within walking distance - multiple restaurants and a small grocery store within minutes as well as shopping theatre yoga conference centre and waterfront running/walking paths within a 15 minute walk.  
The building had  very good security with double locked doors and security at the front desk. I would definitely stay here again."
10710581,95378587,2016-08-19,84904389,Zach,First and formorst the location of Radu's place is perfect. I stayed here with my wife and i was impressed that we were in the center of everything. A couple of minuted walk to Union Station and to the CN tower. Balconies for me are always a plus and Radu has a nice big balcony to come home to.  After a long day of walking and doing touristy things there's nothing like sitting back relaxing and take the sounds of the city in on the balcony. Radu's place was good for me but my wife wasn't a big fan and here is why: the bed was hard. The futon actually was more comfortable. Towels and no wash cloths. We were only giving two towels to last our stay. (4 days) This wasnt a huge problem for me because I just washed the towels but I dont really like wasting water for only a couple of items. And the bed which im going to repeat because it's that important. Overall good place great location. I wouldnt mind stating here again but my wife would object.
3994370,52508462,2015-10-30,34806530,Iris,"Elain & Greg sont des hôtes très attentionnés je me suis sentis de suite a l'aise et il faut dire que tout a était fait pour. Ça restera pendant longtemps je pense une des meilleures expériences airbnb que j'aurai faites. L'appartement est propre jolie et chaleureux. Il est très bien situés j'ai pu faire tout ce que je voulais a moins de 30min en vélo 15min a pied pour rejoindre Dundas square. 
Je recommande fortement aux personnes qui souhaitent venir a Toronto de se rendre chez eux."

19594119,360148686,2018-12-19,150757600,Dale,This was the worst Airbnb experience I have had. The host would not give me the exact physical address when asked. He proved through private email a screenshot of (Hidden by Airbnb) maps marking the road the home was on as well as a picture of the house to try to find it. He stated the home was too hard to find yet when I finally was able to get the address I ordered food and there was no problems with the delivery. The add said host would meet me at check-in but instead let me in through a security camera that he monitored off site. Host texted me at 1:30 am the first night to see if I got the wifi working. The place was absolutely disgusting and in disrepair. There was caked on grime and dirt throughout every room. Junk and garbage piled up.  It was so cold I had to sleep in my hoodie and toque. The linen  cupboard was locked so I could not get another blanket. There were 3 cameras inside the home which caught me off guard. while they were in common areas I think it should have stated they were there Overall this was a very poor experience. Thankfully Airbnb agreed the home was not to standard and refunded me and booked me into a new place.

Leider ist sie Tag und Nacht ziemlich laut deshalb Ohrstöpsel nicht vergessen. Lan antwortet sehr schnell wenn man die fragen hat und ist sehr behilflich. Ich kann die Wochnung weiter empfehlen und würde jedesmal dort wieder wochnen!
13733748,153066425,2017-05-19,94241944,Digdem,My stay at Grace's place was above my expectations. The room and the house was clean and quiet. The room is spacious nicely decorated and has a comfortable desk as a work area. Much better than the pictures that are currently on the website. Check-in was a breeze despite my very early arrival due to flight times. Angie was incredibly accommodating and a great communicator. I enjoyed my stay throughly interacting with Angie Grace and others. I'd do it again and would recommend it. Thank you for everything.

We had a lot of personal space and at the same time we felt their support. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. We are very happy that we have met this nice family and stayed at their place.
6100731,316570962,2018-08-31,181789144,Irmgard,Lauren & Shawns place really is picture perfect. They also provide you with snacks and breakfast. They even bothered to bring me some almond milk once I’ve said I don’t drink milk and herb thea since I don’t drink coffee or normal thea. That’s very thoughtful of them.

The apartment was cosy clean and a comfortable environment for 2 persons. 

Location was very convenient and close to restaurants the subway and the university area. The Catholic Church was right across the street so that made getting up on Sunday even easier!

Would definitely return to Elizabeth's abode if we pass this way again .

Je recommande vivement."

33742232,462509020,2019-06-02,71994779,Kimya,The hosts communicated well & the place is in a good area.. however we had issues with the cleanliness of the place and we had to waste a whole day waiting for the cleaners to come and go during the first night of our stay. We just believe the place should have been cleaned better before we got there to avoid the inconvenience. Other than that it is a decently nice place.
33772577,461183815,2019-05-31,230523334,Thiago,Péssimo o lugar os serviços prestados não condizem com a realidade. Problemas com WiFi ( 5 dias sem o serviço num período de 7 dias total). Sujo não foi realizado limpeza no período indicado. O anfitrião parece ser representante de uma “ empresa anfitriã “ . Quando questionados sobre os serviços não realizados te induzem a sair. Não recomendo. Perceba que alguns anúncios tem as mesmas características das fotos. Figuram- se como novos anúncios as fotos são artísticas usam termos como “ exclusive boutique... “ . Não recomendo .

Chris and Gordana are great hosts. They supplied us with great information regarding the Open Door event that was going on and accommodated our very late check-in due to flight delays. 
Only little drawback is that the building is still partially under construction and the entrance area isn't fully finished. The apartment is done though. Would definitely recommend staying with them.   "
50110,261000713,2018-05-05,81970481,Tatiana,This apartment was in a great location! Super close to public transit. Everything was clean and tidy when we arrived and it was easy to access the apartment. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because the bed was SO CREAKY! Just sitting down on it made a lot of noise and it was a little hard to sleep since every time we rolled around it was quite loud.
25840740,534515620,2019-09-22,297058781,Carleen,The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

4137783,466723940,2019-06-09,23817018,J,I'm a pretty low key traveler and don't need a great deal  because I tend to be out and about.  This time it was a combo of work and play so I spent more time there during the day than usual.  Wifi was solid they had coffee and tea  if I wanted  but really there are no shortage of coffee places and bakeries in the area to try out.  Bed was clean and comfortable.  I was able to do laundry if need be.  I was pretty happy with the location. I was traveling with my dog  so plenty of leash free dog parks to choose from.  There were a few festivals happening in walking distance as well. Parking can be a little tricky in the area  well  Toronto as a whole but Lauren and her husband helped with permits  and warnings about changes in the parking situation. I enjoyed their hospitality and my stay .
30061545,362142797,2018-12-25,227669842,Paula,The place is spacious and pleasant very dogfriendly is close to everywhere and has an incredible view it is also very safe and quiet. The hostess is a super attentive and always looking for anything you need.

19240280,326577974,2018-09-22,48577443,Ann Marie,My first time using Airbnb . We had travelled from Dublin to Toronto and arrived at the apartment in the evening . Our host did not meet us. He left the key with the door man. We were both shocked by the dirt of the apartment. Stained sheets  sticky dirty couch . The oven  fridge and freezer had not been cleaned and there was food left in the fridge and the freezer. Two rusty stools on the balcony and the windows looked they had never been cleaned. The carpet in the bedroom was badly stained.  The washing machine door wouldn't open so we had to go to the basement and pay $10 to wash our clothes. There was no coffee maker no bread knife no bread board and only two knives. We stayed for a week and there was no extra sheets to change the bed. We spoke to our host the following day and told him of all the issues we had . He was upset that we were unhappy and he arranged for the apartment to be cleaned and he purchased the list of items we needed. The apartment was in an excellent location .
18491349,368703582,2019-01-07,196542093,Shane,I haven't seen Christina and Roger in person during my entire stay. The response from them is not one of the quickest and fullest. This is more like a hostel than bnb. I'm satisfied with the value to money and location wise in terms of concvenience to go to downtown by public transportation but the neighborhood is a little beat-up. One serious problem is the cleanness of the place I found a couple of human hairs on my sheet when I first open up the cover. I also found spider webs on top of the fridge and very dusty on most of the furniture and appliances. It's a good place to keep your trip economical if that's your priority consideration.
10943138,75130433,2016-05-19,50372795,Katrina,Great place great location. Paul was very prompt in responding to any questions. 
21264975,494594953,2019-07-24,143615955,Gabrielle,We had a great stay  at Burkhard's place. The neighborhood is very calm and there are many restaurants. The only negative point is the squeaky bed.
12609494,76598433,2016-05-28,71669211,Benjamin,Very good place to stay at in the heart of Toronto's downtown! My host was very helpful and friendly. Had a very comfortable stay in his clean and orderly appartment. 
13436990,362088668,2018-12-25,25019463,Mehmet,Clarence was a great host. The best host we ever had. He gives you lots of tips to do around. We enjoyed the location. Everyone told us to rent near yorkville but for walking and parks definetally little italy was the best. The house was extremely clean. We had all the inventory at the time we arrived we didnt even go to market for to days. We had two kids he set crib for the baby and bed barriers for the 4 years old... he set a playground for him. Even for Christmas he sent the nicest Box of gifts toys chocolates and a note.. we loved him. Thanks again for the wonderful 2  months you made us feel like at home.
6291995,80893776,2016-06-20,54530788,Salome,Michael's place was great! We really enjoyed it it was clean cozy and well presented. He left sticky notes around that made it easy to navigate switches and there was a small array of books DVDs and games which just enhanced the home away from home feel. Michael even had a dehumidifier which is especially great if you have allergies. I highly suggest booking his place if you are visiting Toronto he is located close to the subway for access to downtown and the rest of the GTA. Definitely well worth the money!
38783878,537348262,2019-09-28,69026687,Rafael,Great place to stay in Toronto! It is well located  in Downtown very close to Union Station and  it has a wonderful landscape view!

19440149,190969443,2017-09-05,53742922,Kevin,"Do not choose this property. You will regret it. Apologies for the length but these people must be exposed. We arrived Tues Aug 29 & immediately contacted the hosts Frankie & Trish because among other amenities listed on the description was a washer & dryer. It was upon our arrival that they clarified there actually wasn't a washer and dryer inside the property but instead they were located on the first floor. This is an amenity that we specifically sought for our week-long Anniversary trip so we expressed our displeasure at the misleading information they provided. We've stayed at other AirBnB properties that actually had a washer and dryer so we're well aware of the difference between that and ""washer & dryer accessible."" They agreed to send a representative with laundry detergent and a wash card. We acquiesced and continued to settle in. During the evening of the 29th we noticed several large gnats – in the kitchen in the bedroom in the living room in the bathroom.  After some investigating we discovered that the trash can in the kitchen had not been emptied. It was full of contents from before our arrival. As well there was an odor emanating from the refrigerator. We took out the trash went on YT and found a home remedy of vinegar for killing gnats. That did not work so we again contacted the hosts.  At this point in the afternoon (Aug 30) we still had not received the laundry detergent & wash card.  The hosts expressed their apologies and dismay regarding the gnats and asked how they could rectify the situation.  We requested that they send someone to 1) address the gnat issue 2) clean out the fridge and 3) drop off the wash card & laundry detergent by end-of-day Thursday Aug 31.  Although we were aggravated by the situation we were trying to make the best of things and allow the hosts an opportunity to address our concerns. They replied by asking us for our preferred time and because our actual anniversary fell on Aug 31 we asked for someone to come that morning before 11A. That did not happen. Instead the hosts’ representative Jamal called us on the property landline @ ~1200 to say he would be there in approximately 30 minutes.  Four hrs later we were still waiting.  We contacted the hosts again expressed our frustration at the situation and requested a partial refund for the 2 days of unsatisfactory service.  They agreed but also made it a point to comment “We are also surprised that you did not communicate this to us earlier Jamal no show.” We reminded them of our early morning preference. To suggest that we were somehow deficient in timely correspondence was ludicrous considering that Jamal was already a day late regarding the wash card and laundry detergent and also considering that he called us.  If he wasn’t going to come when promised the burden to call back and let us know fell upon him.  Finally he arrived at 1722 with bug spray a wash..."
25264127,345230727,2018-11-04,10001773,Hannah,George's space was great for our two couples. We each had our own bathrooms and the kitchen was helpful to prepare food for the baby. A single fob between 4 of us was a little challenging but we worked it out and were happy that the location allowed us to walk to all of our commitments over the weekend. Thanks so much!
26394453,499603651,2019-07-31,50374732,Jorge,"Jo is the greatest host you will find on AirBnB; she is a warm respectful and thoughtful person with an amazing place to stay in the city. If you want to talk she will be friendly if you want privacy you got it.

This is definitely a place I would recommend to fellow travelers to visit Toronto. The room has no windows and is very quiet so I was able to rest as I needed. I found myself sleeping like never before and waking up feeling replenished.

Jo will greet you in the morning with some delicious homemade muffins coffee an other amenities. I’m a fan!

Give Jo’s place a try. You will never regret it!"
13938814,138318158,2017-03-19,18077760,Liv,Perfect size for 2 people! So close to the subway and walking distance from great shops and bars. Would definitely recommend. Thanks for the great stay!

31267035,568595893,2019-11-24,9745276,Jean,Gem and John are lovely hosts who provided a cute clean cozy apartment in a quiet neighborhood steps off West Queen Street.  I got to know the area as if I lived there. Gem and John answered my questions quickly and give very useful tips (parking) and recommendations (places to eat and drink) too.  I don't know when I'll be in Toronto again but I'll stay here when I do!
33735429,536847453,2019-09-27,28940345,Katie,Great location with many spots around to eat well at and shop at however since it is a basement unit it's quite chilly. There is however a space heater she provides. At first the place was missing essential things like towels and bathmat but after communicating that to Julie she brought us what we needed.
28661847,497522165,2019-07-28,233404065,Russell,Zach was a wonderful host and his place is great! Communicates well and has a wonderful personality
280249,3148728,2012-12-24,4351398,Emily,"Linda and her brother were very kind and accommodating. The room is in an apartment separate from the owner's house and you share only with other guests (who we never saw). It was a nice little bit of privacy. My main complaint is that the apartment really was not clean enough. The sheets seemed fine and the bedroom was tidy. But the shower was quite grimy with empty bottles of sample toiletries still lying around the handtowel had stains on it and was never changed over our four-night stay. 

The area is alright insofar as it's close to the downtown core but I would not feel comfortable walking here alone at night. "
7971951,215770726,2017-12-01,33031839,Peter,"Great place to stay exactly as described and with a truly spectacular view of the Toronto skyline.

11653577,494551496,2019-07-24,143189124,Annie And James,Great hosts.  Beautiful condo spotless and quite frankly a home away from home.  Great for business travel wifi access and close to the financial district.  Highly recommend Roksolana and Demetre’s place.
22362467,235674277,2018-02-17,397339,Joseph,"Just the right size and location.

This is a wonderful modern apartment with everything 1 or 2 people could need for a great stay in Toronto. For a compact place it is really well designed with great features and put together in a way that really maximizes the space. It feels very open and airy with a really great kitchen and sitting area with lots of light. It has a very nice bathroom with a rain shower deep tub and good storage. It was also nice to be able to go to the gym right downstairs whenever I wanted without having to trek outside. I also loved the enormous TV with Netflix for when I wanted to have a quiet evening in. I really appreciated that it is so close to a couple grocery stores and the Bathurst subway station that got me everywhere I needed to go.

Patrick is incredibly nice and was very responsive with all of my needs. He even gave me great recommendations for the best coffee and food in the area when I asked. All in all it was the perfect place to stay and was sad to leave.

If you're looking for a great place in a great part of the city then I would highly recommend this apartment."
5434497,48162422,2015-09-24,30470620,Rhoda,We really enjoyed staying at Jurias apartment it was really a luxury. It is high up with a magnificent view and is in a great location for sight-seeing and for shopping. We liked that the Condo had amenities with gym and pool it felt like a really fancy hotel. The room itself was very tidy with USB chargers and everything you would need to be comfortable. I can highly recommend this place as being a positive experience and I would book again. Juria was also fast to respond to any questions we had and her communication was excellent.

4861710,364457234,2018-12-30,9522848,Jennifer,I can’t say enough good stuff about this home. It was so clean. The beds and linens were so comfortable I actually slept in! They go above and beyond for their guest. They reply within minutes and even left us a nice card and bottle of wine. Location was perfect. Parking was easy. Walking to everything you could want. We will stay here every time we come to Toronto going forward.

Carla and her family have been awesome  doing everything she could to make our stay enjoyable and nice. 
The flat is well equipped with all the basic necessities for breakfast shower bath washer dryer Netflix... It felt cosy and warm. 
We travelled with our two young children and Carla gave us access to her kitchen for us to prepare meals. She is super well equipped !!! "

15664293,221446023,2017-12-26,30383381,Twee,"Apartment is exactly as described. It's a bit shabby on the outside but inside is a completely 180 degree difference. Very posh modern and clean inside. Full kitchen (stove oven toaster Keurig machine hot water boiler microwave full refrigerator) utensils plates/bowls and pots/pans. We made a Christmas meal during our stay very pleased with how this turned out. Two rooms very spacious for up to 5-6 people. Super clean & modern decorations inside like 3-star hotel. 10-minute walk from Chinatown and shops. One parking space in front of the house. Post-it notes inside house gave us some instructions (i.e. where to put shoes). They have a an Arlo camera at the front of the house and know  exactly when who comes and leave. Thermostat is app controlled. Bathroom is clean shower is tiled. Hardwood floors with some carpet mats around the beds and in bathroom. TV has basic cable channels.

Very convenient and quick communication via Airbnb website/app. It's a team of 3 people managing the property and they were thorough in details and instructions they sent for us to check in the day before we arrive there. We needed a two hours extension for check out and they were accommodating. Highly recommended!"

It's really clean confortable has a great yard and Josh is a great host.
25262246,346143003,2018-11-07,9875912,Erika,"My mother and I only spent a night there en route to an overseas trip but we really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is great - lots of space and very cool decor - I found myself taking mental notes of how I could adopt the style in my home. The location is great - easy access from Union station and airport and a fun walkable neighborhood. Mark is a very responsive host - I had answers to my booking questions and check-in questions very promptly. 
Great stay - I would be nervous about my small children (who were not with me) wreaking havoc on the beautiful aesthetic - but it would be wonderful for family with older kids or a group of 3-4 adults."

39433116,560680084,2019-11-07,225349654,Sudeep,I found everything perfect except for the difficulty in the availability of grocery store or a market at walkable distance. Overall we had a great experience and definitely recommend it to other travellers. They have a great place and one should definitely rent it out if they are looking for a great place to stay. It’s peaceful and away from all the noise. We would definitely rent this place again if we happen to visit Canada again. Connie is a wonderful host and kudos to her for playing the part to perfection.
21170536,208264758,2017-10-31,62066689,Sophia,Frank was an amazing host. The place was clean and offered awesome amenities. Frank was quick to respond and made us feel right at home.

14760481,284398769,2018-07-01,196187728,Roxane,We really enjoyed our stay. Charming place and convenient location. About 20 minutes from downtown Toronto by car. The suite was sparkling clean the hospitality was  great our host made us feel right at home. And I loved the fact that we could cook our own meals. It is true that a small part of the ceiling of the kitchen is a bit low but it did not bother my husband. The rest of the ceiling in the kitchen bedroom and bathroom are higher therefore not an issue.  I  will definetly recommend Andrew's place in fact we came back yesterday and I already recommended it today to a friend. It was really a great stay!
20665369,217935572,2017-12-10,129573444,Arthur,Very nice place for a big group. Comfortably fit 8 people and was convenient to get anywhere we wanted in the city.

30820195,509474589,2019-08-14,283551154,Jake,Calvin's place surprised me a lot. For the price and the location I wasn't expecting much to be honest. I booked very last minute just looking for a place to crash. The actual unit is super clean super modern with many many amenities. Calvin himself is super helpful and clearly cares a lot about being a good host and about improving his place as much as possible. Great place great host good location too!

좋은 점은? 거리. 다운타운. 파킹 가능한 것. 그궤 끝입니돠. 앞집 뭐하는쥐 다 보이궈 (그렇담 우리도 보이는거) 블 (Hidden by Airbnb) 드를 치려하니 뿌사져있고.... 쓰레기통 발판도 뿌사져있고 심지어 방 안 침대 옆에 창고 같은게 있는데 그 문도 부숴졌...구요.

It is very convenient to the train station and right by a supermarket to get any quick needs. Plenty of room for many guests and well furnished for 6 people.
20772163,420387836,2019-03-06,26796665,Andrea,My colleague and I stayed at Alex’s place for a work trip. It was great. Very spacious clean and had everything we needed. Alex was very attentive and checked in to ensure we had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again!
20771358,233419609,2018-02-09,154873230,Cheryl,Sunita provided a very impeccably clean apartment. It was surprisingly warm for a basement apartment. Sunita went above and beyond with providing many amenities with the apartment ( body wash shampoo continental breakfast items coffee teas milk juice water) I did not have to go do much grocery shopping with what she had provided. She even made me a fresh baked banana bread and supper upon my arrival in the evening. The new bed was very comfortable. The apartment was very quiet and Sunita and her family were always available whenever I had any questions. The apartment is walking distance ( 15 mins) to a couple of shopping malls which have grocery stores/ walmart/ restaurants) and there is a bus stop a very short distance away. I highly recommend  staying at this place. 5 Star plus I rate this place. ❤️
5631851,96337112,2016-08-22,45482047,Jasmine,Chantelle was very informative and really laid back. Her apartments location was perfect. Right next to the water and in walking distance of the entertainment district. Parking was I think $20 for 24 hours and it was across the street. There was a pool and nice gym in the building. Overall good experience :)

23501991,298602654,2018-07-29,21445957,Gail,Great location but more attention to detail required around the apartment itself.  Check-in confusing and too high a price for what you get.
10835701,199297562,2017-10-01,61135436,Hugh,"What I love about this host is their proactive communication. They will definitely make sure you have what you need before your trip! Top notch.

This spot was a bit smaller than expected but the location makes up for it.

The bed is unbelievably comfortable which is really the thing that mattered the most in the space!"

Celestine is a wonderful host providing thoughtful touches to make your stay comfortable. I really appreciated the milk and cereal for the first morning.  We felt safe and at home and would stay here again without question."

20761475,457610689,2019-05-24,263252245,Jake,Fantastic place! It is in an amazing part of the city with lots going on at all hours. Had such a great time the place it self was super nice and everything you needed was there even down to the red solo cups. Would recommend to anyone coming to the city and looking to experience everything it has to offer at an amazing value!
14335973,470732588,2019-06-16,235070138,Nick,Great place for the price clean though the bed is very loud and any time you move it'll wake up the neighborhood. No couch or comfortable seating if you want to watch TV either.
27327623,512571750,2019-08-18,27490342,Catherine,Exactly what we were looking for and as described! The location is great - a 2 minute walk to the beach and so close to many restaurants in the area. The place itself was so clean and lots of nice touches. Andrew was very quick in replying to any questions and requests that we had.

But you can also go by bus or streetcar. We felt very comfortable here and can recommend the airbnb to anyone.  We would like to come again
22106205,299720912,2018-07-31,29155191,Thiago,Tim is a great guy! The best host you could ever have! His apartment is great and all areas are clean and nice to stay. My wife and I stayed 13 days in his place and Tim helped us to find an apartment in Toronto indicating the best neighborhoods. He was always kind and solicitous to anything that we could need.

14585973,321569562,2018-09-10,5080182,Marc,Scott's place is great he is a great host and a gorgeous house in the Trinity Bellwoods area. The room is quiet has central air and all the amenities you will need.  The bathroom is gorgeous and has a wonderful rain shower. Scott is usually working from home and available to answer any of your questions you may need. The location is perfect for getting around all of Toronto and is in the best area for restaurants and bars. I highly recommend staying at his place.

6304719,66747012,2016-03-24,60729225,Christian,"I stayed there with my family totaling 6 persons. The place is nice  and bright as on the pictures. However unfortunately it was not as clean as one expects. Some of the towels were definitely not washed (having make up and lipstick marks and hair). Fortunately the place has a washer and dryer so we could wash the towels and remove the stains.
We were not certain if the bedding was changed or someone else slept in there before because it didn't smell freshly washed and we found hair on the sheets."
24558138,527782047,2019-09-11,17912007,Fernanda,The place is very clean and organized it has a nice kitchen with everything needed to prep quick meals. It takes only a 10min walk from eglinton subway station to get there. The hosts are very friendly and answered quickly to all our messages. Check in and check out instructions were super clear.
12799178,179090046,2017-08-06,111509203,Federico,Was not my first time in Toronto so I already know the city. Honestly the location is perfect you can take the subway (that is 5 min by walk from the house) or just walk (20min from Yonge-Dundas square). I took a single room with a single bed and I didn't have any kind of problem. I recommend it simple and clean.
2267889,70676015,2016-04-19,61996230,Catherine,Genevieve was amazing! She was extremely accomodating and replied right away when contacted. The apartment was very clean true to pictures very well organized and beautifully decorated. (Loved the wood table in the dining area by the way). Genevieve also provided a binder on the kitchen table with directions to the wnearest subway station the bus schedules for the buses that went in Waterloo as well as her personal recommendations for places to see in Waterloo. The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable and overall this was an amazing place to stay. Would absolutely go back again! I know that some people have mentioned that you do hear some noise from the house above but my husband and I had no problem with it and it's really as much noise as you would normally get when you're in an apartment with another one above you. Overall fantastic experience!!! :D 
10646501,215416218,2017-11-29,154710003,Joel,Andrew is a great host and easy to work with - would definitely stay again.
19531218,352737055,2018-11-25,226254167,Monique,Dave is extremely considerate and also very knowledgeable about the city. Showed me around and took me to several spots only a local would know about. Friendly and kind host clean room good access to bus stops and subway station. The fact that the place isn’t at downtown is not a problem at all. In fact for being located in such a nice and quiet neighborhood it’s guaranteed a good night of sleep. I would definitely stay there again.

27524546,494567296,2019-07-24,253570025,Abdon,Place is located in a convenient location. Lack of respect from other guests in term to keep civility during the night and the fact that the owner couldn't succeed on respecting the rules may me leave the facilities at 12 am. For 2 nights I couldn't sleep because the loud music and people laughing and screaming was too much.
27266110,452588919,2019-05-13,178867362,Mohamed,Great hospitality
789266,233425911,2018-02-09,10594158,Mimi,A great repeat stay at Michelle's. Highly recommended if you require a walkable west end home away from home. Such a high style spacious yet cozy and welcoming home. Great linens and kitchen amenities. Right on Dundas W but surprisingly peaceful. Fantastic local offerings all within 3 blocks stroll. The place has a couple minor quirks but Michelle's gracious hosting has solutions for all. Would definitely return for a third stay and beyond!
35060837,557231017,2019-10-31,301133612,Candice,This location was amazing and close to amenities.  The response time to inquiries before we arrived was fast and extremely helpful.   The unit was clean and exactly as expected.  We would rent time property again without hesitation.

26474360,540451758,2019-10-03,293219717,Xi,The place is very clean. Behjat and her husband gave us a warm welcome.  The place has all the amenities. It is my parents' first time to come to Canada and they love the place. I would recommend this place for anyone!
26066413,514691696,2019-08-21,119484105,Ines,Benjamín has a beautify and confortable house. The location is good near to CN Tower parks and near to subway I recommend so much.
15597460,303970495,2018-08-08,61716935,Katie,"Emily is a wonderful host and very personable. The space is a good size to be comfortable and relax in and the area is very quiet. The proximity to L’Amoreaux Park made this place perfect for me as I needed a place to put in a few miles everyday. 
The closest grocery stores are Asian supermarkets (and if you can’t read Chinese no worries there is English writing everywhere too). The kitchen worked well for me to cook my own food but I didn’t see a spatula or similar cooking utensils so I used chopsticks to move my food around the wok. Worked perfectly for me. 
I had read other reviews about there not being towels so I had brought my own. Not sure if I could have asked for one or not but I was not provided one. 
Overall I was happy with my week-long stay here and felt relaxed and ready to do well in my competition the next week. I would stay here again and it’s hard to beat the price!"
5825038,147042326,2017-04-24,45236432,Joel,Our trip was very short but everything was as advertised and Anita and Ben made us feel very welcomed. Thank you.

29848931,462859445,2019-06-02,8719279,Veronica,I returned to TO after a few days in Ottawa and was greeted with a warm welcome. Curtis&TC pay meticulous attention to details and put a lot of effort into making their house a 'home'! I felt totally safe and comfortable in the cozy & tidy basement. I also got the chance to share travel experiences with them:-) I left early Sunday morning to catch my flight and Curtis was so kind to drive me to the nearest subway station. I highly recommend their place to anyone who would like to stay in a 'home' away from home!
13769161,179010929,2017-08-06,126496300,Maya,Maureen was the most helpful and attentive host I've ever had. Any questions or concerns we had she was there to help. She even let us use her stapler printed our parking pass for us and notified us of items we had left behind before we even left the city . Her place was clean and organized and had everything we could've possibly needed. Perfect size for 3 people. 
10309309,83861240,2016-07-04,75098496,Tara,"This was my first experience with airbnb. Unfortunately it has put me off of the idea entirely. The reviews for this apartment made me very optimistic but unfortunately my stay was less than enjoyable. When we arrived the apartment seemed ok it was rather warm as it was 30 degrees outside but the host was willing to turn the air conditioner on. We booked to stay for 2 nights Sat and Sun. It was myself my sister and a friend. On Saturday evening we noticed quite a few ants in the apartment and the Ac had been turned off. Being in the basement we were willing to deal with this and move on. I made sure to rinse any cups/cans used to keep the ant issue under control. We applied our own bag in the tiny garbage can to ensure the best results. The next morning around 9 we noticed it was not a small and issue at all the basement was infested with ants in the 10s. I contacted the host and received the following reply. ""Yes we're working on it but it's a slow process apparently. For now just clean them up as you see them. I have ant killer up here I can reapply it"" upon receiving this message we weren't quite sure what clean them up meant in the event that there were so many and nothing to use. The host never came to apply the ant killer he didn't even come to see the issue. We ended up using windex to try to be rid of them it only worked on some and we were left with the rest. We decided at this time that we would leave and not stay the second night. I contacted the host to tell him this and was told the issue was fixed (after we had left). He refused to consider refunding us for the 2nd night even though we were very open about the issue and asked for help. He proceeded to tell me we left an excessive mess and complained that we 3 females used 4 towels. I wasn't aware there was a limit to towel use. In addition to this before leaving we made the bed folded the blankets on the couch hung up our towels and were sure to put all garbage in the tiny can (it was said that we left it overflowing) I provided the bag myself for the tiny can and everything was in it the lid did not close. I didn't realize this was excessive mess. We were accused of spills being on the floor and breaking the shower knob. I cannot even grasp at these lies I leave hotel rooms as I enter them let alone someone's home. If anything was left messy or damaged I would immediately acknowledge it and offer to pay. We were 3 mature adults having a few nights away. There was no reckless individuals present. I was appalled by the response. I was told I..."

Recomendo muito a estadia na casa da Cathy! É uma imersão importante na cultura Canadense."

Very clean and all the amenities you could ask for with a fully equipped kitchen which we used a lot. I loved that there was pop/beers available in the fridge and thought the honesty jar system was great for this. We also really appreciated the tips sheet which included local recommendations. Plus good WiFi and located in a super nice area. Can't fault the place! Thank you Phil!

4311914,166449567,2017-07-03,20782838,Jessie,Good situation.Nice neighbors.Convenient  Parking.When we arrived we can't open the door because of wrong password setting.When we opened the dishwasher All dishes last guests had used were still filling in. When we collected trash bags according to the direction above the garbage bin we found all the trash beans too full to add on.Therefore we think the house can be better.
9493062,489837723,2019-07-17,18770954,Shaikh,Amazing location! Great for visits to downtown Toronto. The views from the apartment can’t get any better.

In addition the place was really clean a nice couch and a big tv and good water pressure in the shower. This was my first airbnb so I wasn't good about checking my messages and needed a parking space John arranged that for us while we were driving up very last minute and it was great.
35381453,469411844,2019-06-14,262314331,Juan Jose,100% limpio pero falta de atención al detalle la zona es muy cercana al centro de la ciudad. El ingreso es algo complicado para una persona con poca movilidad pero la privacidad es muy buena la comodidad y espacios son idóneas al precio
25426961,416929283,2019-02-25,88759045,Alexandra,The location is very convenient especially if you are flying Billy Bishop. Very walkable part of the city easy to get to Queen St West. Secure clean modern building. Unfortunately no pool access as was advertised at the time I booked.
6843406,104134434,2016-09-25,31418110,Amber,David's home was charming comfortable and clean. We had a great sleep -- the beds were super comfie and the house is very quiet. We were just a short walk to the heart of Queen West - great restaurants coffee and shopping.

37431114,560731858,2019-11-07,299160117,Nizza Joy,We stayed at Jen's place for 3 nights. Upon arrival we were sooo happy how beautiful the place is and the location is just superb you have the CN tower as your view which you will never get tired of looking. However as we explore the place further we noticed that it wasn't clean very well. We found hairs on the bed which made us doubt if the sheets were even washed. My friends and I had to vacuum again and we washed the sheets just to make sure. I messaged Jen with a prompt response which is great. We couldn't get the TV work which I think was the previous renters fault. Ty I think came by the next day and fixed it for us. Some stuff written in the description such as salt and pepper weren't available so I guess it needs an update. Overall it was a nice stay. It was still a memorable experience with my friends.
15082256,211297318,2017-11-12,154688064,Jenn,The location is perfect for all downtown activities!! And the fact that there is a Longo’s and LCBO located directly below the building was awesome for grabbing food snacks and drinks! We didn’t even have to go outside in the cold!
6732046,156641332,2017-05-31,19241471,Desmond,Jonathan & Joanne really deserve to be called super hosts - we were really impressed with what they had available and their personalities are great for hosting people!  They provided a pack-n-play toys and books for our 19-month-old son ensuring the place was kid-friendly.  I can't imagine better hosts than them!  Thank you so much Jonathan & Joanne!! =D

Pall was also really quick to reply with any questions or concerns we had. The upstairs guests were quite loud on our first night while we were trying to sleep but Pall was able to get ahold of them and deal with the situation. Great value overall.

13031045,225475914,2018-01-06,108863623,Mitchell,The room was perfect for 2 people but could manage 3 and had alot to offer with a microwave  coffee maker  and a kitchenette. The bathroom was well maintained and clean. The location is amazing and you will not find a better value for a night's stay downtown Toronto. It was about an 8 min walk to the St George terminal and we could park our vehicle on site so there was no stress of having to drive anywhere. Natasha was not physically there but offered us lots of support and was very helpful and quick to respond to my questions. Couldn't have asked for a better host. Highly recommend staying here!

6047019,261479587,2018-05-06,31520679,Daniel,Crystal was incredibly accommodating of an uncharacteristically chaotic check-in; she accepted our booking the day before we were to arrive after another host cancelled and she rolled with the punches after our flight into Toronto was delayed. Eminently responsive and thoughful Crystal was a dream host and her elegant condo with terrific amenities made our stay in Toronto one better than we could have hoped.

He was understanding when my flight arrived at 1130pm and was still willing to give me a house tour. Everything was very clean and very roomy! There were plenty of cooking supplies dishes linen towels etc. Thank you again for the wonderful stay!
1856109,252437701,2018-04-10,6147190,Dragos,This place we awesome. The location was great for us as we headed off to see tourist attractions with easy. It is basically 3minutes away from the subway. Perfectly located one smal block of the main street so the street noise is inexistent. Very little noose from upstairs. It is a garage apartment so little light is expected. The decor is homely.

14471456,282167045,2018-06-26,12404591,Jeremy,LP's place was in the perfect location close to transit and shops and services. The place was beautiful with all the amenities you could ask for! Was very clean and organized and check-in was breeze. I had won a contest and they want to ship it back to my place and I didn't have time so LP allowed me to send it to her place. Very fast communication! Would definitely stay again :)

32184389,503783642,2019-08-06,181157772,Eleni,"This stay has probably been the worst experience I’ve had on air bnb. 
First and foremost the suite was not the problem it was the communication with the host that was the issue. 
On the day of our arrival we realized that our flight would not be getting in during the three hour window for check in so naturally we made sure to contact the host to let them know we would be coming in past check in hours. Someone over the phone had said everything would be fine as long as we followed the check in instructions that were texted to us. The reporting instructions called for us to enter a code to a part of the building that housed the lock boxes with keys for each room. 
Unfortunately the key for our room was missing when we got there with the lock box to assigned room completely open. We were trying to contact the host several times and they were not answering messages through the app and they were not picking up our calls. Whoever was on call that night later responded to us saying they were “at an event and they couldn’t talk to us over the phone.”
Long story short responses were very delayed and the responder had no idea where our keys were so they had to put us in a different room for the night. The room that he put us in was smaller dirty and clearly not made up from the previous guests. No sheets on the beds no towels the bathroom was filthy and we never got a response from the host after I had told him the condition that this room was I and for him to keep us updated on our original room. That night we slept in a space that was absolutely unacceptable for Airbnb standards.
The next morning we heard a knock on the door from who we then learned was the house keeper. She immediately apologized and did not realize she had taken the key with her after cleaning our scheduled suite and seemed very genuine. We completely understood that the part she played was an accident and we were not upset with her but as we went on further expressing our frustration with the situation she had said “wow I wish they would’ve asked me about the keys I would’ve ran them over last night I live so close I didn’t know.” 
It was then that we became even more upset that’s our host could have reached out to her knowing that there could be a possibility the key could be with someone from housekeeping to alleviate the problem but instead we had just spent the night in a filthy room. 
After getting into our new room we realized it was not prepared for 4 guests; the number we had listed. We had to ask housekeeping for pillows towels and sheets. The only thing that bothered us about the room was the pull out couch was stained and smelly.
We had tried to ask them to bring us a comforter and toilet paper in the middle of our stay and they said they would but no one ever brought us any. 
After that whole situation with our room we had tried to contact the host a series of times to figure when we can plan a phone call conversation to talk about a refund. The host knowing that we had gone through all that did not even contact us till 7pm the next evening. Stating that they were trying to accommodate our late check in and situations like ours could’ve been avoided if we came during the hours house keeping was in the building. 
It was super upsetting to receive a response like that. After several delayed responses and never getting not one simple phone call they had finally said they would issue a refund for our first night. I had messaged them asking when I should see the refund in my account and at no surprise I still don’t have a response. 
Let’s just say this whole experience ruined our whole weekend in Toronto. If you want an air bnb host that is prepared responsive and sympathetic this is not the one for you. 
I truthfully would not recommend this place to my friends or family."

Host was welcoming and checked in regularly to make sure everything was okay.

We were conveniently located in the heart of downtown within walking distance to most of tourist attractions! Might I add the price was amazing for the location! The apartment was spotless with more utensils and home items than expected! And the wrap around balcony with the CN tower and Lake Ontario in the background made for an awesome photo shoot 

Al was quick with his responses and so accommodating to our last minute change! Thank you for making my birthday trip that more comfortable and pleasurable in freezing Toronto 

I will book you any and every time I can!! "

28633724,524779425,2019-09-06,257579286,Alan,For anyone coming to Toronto this is perfect place. With a location right on the lake bus ride away from downtown and 5 minutes from local shops and bars and restaurants this could not be bettered. It’s peaceful and quiet. Zenya is a great host. The apartment has the basic you need it’s clean and light and airy. And with prompt reply to queries the service Zenya provides is first rate. I hope to be back

The space is great for a couple. It is a bit old though and the kitchen could be better equipped but the price was really good.

12042727,123101226,2016-12-27,31631893,Damien,We stayed at Kim & Neils place over Christmas 2016. Our family have stayed at airbnb's all over the world and this place is the best yet. Kim and Neil are great hosts The property is centrally located and the house itself is fantastic for a big family. Kim's attention to detail is flawless. Great bathrooms plenty of linen well stocked kitchen I could go on and on. This place is perfect.
20798561,528704693,2019-09-13,11771789,Scott,"You couldn’t ask for a better location as the apartment was located right in the heart of the Entertainment distract in Downtown Toronto. Check in was quick and easy.

In terms of the place itself it’s very much a city apartment meaning it’s very compact but it works well for a single person or a couple. It has everything you would need in an apartment minus a few minor issues I had. 

You can tell that this place has been used as an Airbnb for a while now as half of the blinds in the living room were broken. The place looked like it was half cleaned with some trash still in the unit and a water bottle that was half way filled sitting on the kitchen counter.

In terms of the bedroom the missing blinds caused the room to be very bright in the am. In addition the bed was very uncomfortable due to the fact that the springs in the mattress felt like they were coming up.

As a host Kev was friendly and responsive but when I spoke to him about my issues he didn’t seem to care all that much. I got a simple “I’ll get them fixed” response but that didn’t help me. 

As long as these few issues were addressed I would happily stay with Kev again because of the location being so perfect."
9826723,218707028,2017-12-14,31663097,Katie,Very clean comfortable bed. Ivy is extremely prompt to reply. Great location!
27877707,462930972,2019-06-02,191500967,Sandra,This is a perfect place to stay in Toronto. Everything is in walking distance especially the Metro convention center. ( that was  our purpose for the trip) Graham was a great host and was very accommodating. He was very quick to respond to any questions or concerns we may have had. His condo  is really nice and we would definitely stay there again!
14874961,279754920,2018-06-21,81565338,Greg,The place was what we expected and it was worth the cost we paid. Satisfied customer.

35604779,553246008,2019-10-23,55261214,Angela,"This place is in a perfect location!  Plenty of things to see/do within walking distance and Union Station is moments away if you need transit in general or if you are taking the Union Express from the Pearson airport.

We really appreciated the opportunity to drop off our bags earlier than 4pm since the previous guests had left earlier than the check-out time.  Nabeelah was very easy to connect with before and during our stay.

The place was clean and just as presented in the photos.

Having the extra bed was very convenient as we used it as a ""catch all"" for our stuff so even though there is little storage in a downtown TO condo you can really utilize that extra bed if you don't need it as a sleeping space.

Couple things of note:
If you plan to use both beds please note that the sliding glass doors for the actual bedroom are clear glass with no frosting so no privacy.  This wasn't a problem for us but may be for others.

The box spring for the bed in the actual bedroom is quite noisy *very* creaky.  If you happen to get up in the middle of the night there's no way to be quiet.  We almost considered sleeping on the other bed as that one wasn't noisy at all but we were using that as our catch all."

13876498,245495961,2018-03-22,72122007,Erin,Dene’s place was super close to Exhibition Place where I was attending a conference. It is also close to many shops and great restaurants. Clean comfortable and an amazing view.
1360718,78165572,2016-06-05,1127705,Marjo,Glenn's house was very beautiful the room and bathroom were cozy and clean. I also liked the green backyard a lot. The neighborhood is central yet quiet and calm. It was easy to get along with Glenn. I highly recommend this place and would be happy to stay there again.
28264606,558182917,2019-11-02,62929445,Tracy,We enjoyed our stay as it was perfectly situated to access all downtown attractions and activities. The accommodations were convenient and clean. The views of the CN Tower were spectacular!
14093125,220268578,2017-12-21,85180894,Steve,Nice condo in a quiet and convenient location with public transportation very close. A short walk to Liberty Village and the eclectic Queen's Street with markets restaurants and bars. Nadia is a great host that is readily available if there are questions or concerns. It was a great experience for my extended stay.

6843406,286563701,2018-07-06,46504966,Simon,This location is just so convenient and the neighborhood is fantastic to explore with lots of little local shops and eateries on Queen and Dundas and also quite convenient to Chinatown and the Spadina corridor not to mention practically everywhere given the tramlines close by. The apartment is comfortable and quiet. King bed has a memory foam topper and is quite comfy. Other br is a queen. Bathroom nicely redone with very large shower. Good supply of nice towels. Really large place with lots of room. Stairs are a bit steep and narrow which might be a problem for some. We had our 20 month old daughter with us and she did fine in the space. When we are back in toronto we would stay here again no question. We didn't meet David but he was very responsive to messaging before during and after our trip.
18776711,322998041,2018-09-14,64436390,Bharat,Louise and Bal are simply great hosts; they were always prompt in responding to my messages. The house was neat and well-maintained the room was cosy there was always coffee tea and some snack :) and the locality was awesome ! I highly recommend them to you.
12007026,320288858,2018-09-08,3031046,Mélanie,"La chambre est idéalement située dans downtown ; tout est accessible à pieds (les restaurants les magasins notamment).

Les parties communes sont propres et tout est mis à disposition : une colocation qui fonctionne très bien car les règles de vie sont indiquées avant même l'arrivée dans la maison.

Par contre à moins d'avoir le sommeil lourd ou l'habitude des boules quiès sont indispensables (centre ville oblige : travaux au coin de la rue et sirènes de pompiers à toutes heures du jour et de la nuit) mais cela est bien indiqué par James avec les règles de la maison."
20256395,293091885,2018-07-19,75433825,Marie-Laure/Fabrice,Lovely and really cleaning house. Good geographic place to go to Toronto Down town near bus station and Subway.  We recommand it !

6641916,572342942,2019-12-02,152051268,Elaine,Guy & Darlene’s place is truly amazing!! Probably the best Airbnb I’ve stayed! The place is the definition of “sparkling clean”! Looks even more impressive in person than in photos! Every furniture decorations and arrangements are well thought out! You can tell they really put in a lot of effort to ensure everyone’s comfort and meet all our needs! Bed is also extremely comfortable!! Even better than home! Would highly recommend!
12737927,76016715,2016-05-24,8088609,Gabriel,"The house was very well located. All the services were close by the subway station and park and everything else we could need.

Ryan let us use the bar-b-q which was appreciated. He was a good host. Lots of room. I was there with my wife and 2 small children. They slept comfortably upstairs while we still had all the downstairs to est and hang out in. The kitchen was very big and all the amenities were there. Parking was a must and was provided.

The upstairs bathroom is very small but was fine for a couple of days. We would have liked to have some drawers set aside to put our personal belongings instead of keeping them on the floor. There seemed to be a lack a surfaces to put things on. 

We also found the pace tidy but could have been a little cleaner.

We would definitely return here because it met most of our needs.


Thanks again Ryan.

36118964,505617941,2019-08-09,47622265,Ellison,It is an exceptional property not a large space but quite efficient. Very comfortable and new from the building to the furnishings. Once the construction( it is ongoing) the place will be extraordinarily. Location is great and adjacent to the downtown area. Walk or uber to most attractions. Richard was extremely helpful.  His instructional video priceless. Well worth it!
31038635,426282656,2019-03-20,11332144,Stefan,Great place perfect location near large conference sites. Really quiet and far better than many local hotels.
22151339,561533877,2019-11-09,123653091,Brian,Great place close to Ryerson where I was visiting my son.  Levee and Jose are outstanding hosts and very easy going.  Room is basic.  Very clean and tidy.   I appreciated the parking.
31652227,522865522,2019-09-02,279546992,Daniel,Great host and comfy amenities with few unexpected personal touches.
16335447,246514879,2018-03-25,91274860,Jared,Jonathan's place offers a great value in a convenient location--and is within walking distance to many great restaurants and bars. The free off-street parking allowed for us to leave the car parked and explore Toronto by public transit (located close to the place). The apartment itself is very comfortable quiet and private and both Jonathan and his wife are very friendly and communicative. I would stay here again without hesitation.
33931772,540016103,2019-10-02,49649781,Andrew,"We arrived in Toronto at 1630 to hot humidity and heavy rain. Taxi (and Uber) Farr from Union station was nearly 50 dollars due to the time I guess. We had chosen to abandon dinner up the CN tower due to the rain and saving our luggage from getting soaked. The room was well presented if small in what appeared to me to have previously been a hostel but I may be mistaken. I was told that the 1st floor had been renovated for air bnb rentals. 
Compared to downtown hotel rates we paid less than half prices quoted on those hotel sites. So good value. Breakfast was not great but sufficed. Unfortunately for us the weather remained awful and we chose to head to the airport early the next day and collect our rental car. Hence we will need to visit Toronto again. 
I would stay here again because of its value compared to alternatives."

It also was perfect for getting to downtown  as it was only a quick car or train ride to downtown. A few times I walked to the Convention Centre downtown  which was slightly longer but very easy. 

Wengsi also sweetly left a map and tips for places to go  which was so helpful for a new visitor like me! I highly recommend staying here for a comfy affordable stay in Toronto."

22036701,259245111,2018-04-30,151403838,Emmanuel,What a great little place ! Lovely mood friendly and helpful host. Everything went smooth I recommend !

23756166,468079707,2019-06-11,233958617,Cailey,What a wonderful place to stay! Highly recommend if you’re traveling to Toronto.
17643109,267416557,2018-05-21,132663118,Katharina,Tiffany ist ein toller Host sehr hilfsbereit und nett. Die Wohnung bzw. das Zimmer hatte leider einige Defizite wie z.B. mangelhafte Sauberkeit im Bad Zimmer über einer Bar (enormer Lärmpegel) sowie kein Fenster (wurde sehr warm Lüftung zwar vorhanden jedoch sehr laut). Für einen längeren Aufenthalt würden wir uns mehr Komfort wünschen für eine Nacht ist es zweckmäßig und ok.
19029163,562269803,2019-11-10,11549390,Cara,A charming room in an amazing location in the city. I recently moved away from Toronto and on this visit back I was especially excited to stay here so close to so many great restaurants and bars. (Rest assured though that you don't really get much street noise since the house is on a small side street.) I was later checking in than I originally expected but Jia made sure it would be no problem. She also kindly let me check out a bit later in the morning to  accommodate my plans. The room has a lockable door and is a great size with plenty of simple seating a desk and lots of closet & drawer space. Having the private ensuite bathroom is awesome - the shower is small but there's also a Jacuzzi tub in there! (I only wish I had enough time to try  it.) The bed is quite firm and the pillows a bit floppy but it was comfortable for me. I met Jia's family who live in the house -- they are very nice and you may meet them when you come in and out or hear them going about their day or smell the meals they cook (the bedroom is just off the kitchen area). I came home pretty late both nights I stayed there and it wasn't a problem at all even though I was walking through the common areas. (Obviously I did try to be quiet!) For a short stay for 1 or 2 people this is an incredible value. Thank you Jia!

18430765,467648228,2019-06-10,17260142,Ramy,The flat is in a perfect location. Walking distance to the subway. Pamela was also kind enough to let me check out a bit later than usual. Highly recommended if you want somewhere private central and well equipped.
24371282,264284676,2018-05-13,317744,Nikki,Kevin and Ophelia’s space was perfect - such a great location big windows and extremely clean. They were easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Would definitely recommend!
5016678,98354720,2016-08-30,64995455,Warren,Beautiful basement suite with all the amenities you'll need in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Robbie was a great host providing us even a map of local restaurants and bars.
28047686,526909358,2019-09-09,91679460,Rachelle,We loved our stay here! A great area in Toronto lots of great restaurants and bars around and very close to transit. The loft itself is beautiful great natural light bed is super comfy. We would definitely  want to stay here again!
10835701,161062102,2017-06-16,86942186,Glenn,Wonderful place to stay!!!
21667340,241056400,2018-03-07,102782088,Lori-Anne,Elias’s place was perfect for our group of 16 people the two separate apartments were definitely a perk because some of us could be louder in one and others could have peace and quiet in the other. It was great to have two kitchens and the rooms were very spacious. We were also very well isolated from outside noise and communication with Elias was easy and quick. Chinatown is not the cleanest area in town but there is a great choice of authentic restaurants. The nearby underground parking was also very convenient.
11594529,116035378,2016-11-27,85185047,Jeremy,This place in in a great location. You can walk to union station CN Tower the Aquarium and a lot more. The pool and workout rooms are clean and in good shape. The view is really nice. I would have liked to have had more kitchen utensils pots and pans. Also the washer was a little dingy. Overall this was a fantastic value and I would definitely stay here again.
14075100,268687526,2018-05-25,66268244,Nafisa,This is a great place to stay in an awesome lively location! The apartment is very clean and the rooms are spacious. Reem was an excellent host throughout making sure that everything needed was taken care of and checking in if I had any questions or concerns. She was super friendly and helpful and gave great suggestions of places to eat/shop/hang out in the neighbourhood. I would highly recommend staying here and will definitely come back.
14282725,235695154,2018-02-17,120230547,Crystal,"Our family was specifically looking for a place to call home for a month and Cindy and Michael's apartment did not disappoint. A wonderful place to stay and call home for any period of time. We could go and come as we pleased. Close to public transport and great little shops and restaurants. With 2 small kids this place was great. They had space to play and loved the snow man Michael built a memory they will cherish. 

Cindy and Michael themselves are very nice people and extremely helpful. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy your apartment. I would recommend this apartment for anyone wanting to explore Toronto while enjoying the comforts of home when you lay your head down to sleep."
32387616,546330054,2019-10-13,28569635,Don & Ming,"Excellent location. We literally walked to most of attractions. For places that are farther we were able to catch subways and trains in short distance. 

We enjoyed Newman’s place very much."
445708,151955389,2017-05-14,15769414,Jean-Karim,Megan is great host. Her loft is very nicely decorated and well equipped. Super clean. Boutique hotel type of feeling but in a very big loft in the heart of Kensington market. Recommended!
27980430,426639643,2019-03-21,122742677,Janna,The neighbourhood/general area is pretty sketchy but at least since it's in downtown Toronto places like the Eaton Centre are within walking distance. I just wouldn't recommend walking around here after dark. The room itself is very stylish and clean. Bed is very comfortable but it can get noisy at night. Hosts were communicative and friendly. Good value overall.
39137057,560683638,2019-11-07,16778383,Jay,Azis place had everything I needed for a one night business stay. Very safe block in heart of downtown super clean easy communication and really good value! The view - which was frankly breathtaking - was a bonus :)
4507958,91723555,2016-08-06,29586667,Illy,"We came to this flat with our child  and my mother and enjoyed it very much. my mother uses a wheelchair and the apartment was fully accessable.
The neiburhood is very nice and the flat itself makes you feel at home. It is clean specious and has a nice balcony.
We had the impression that people leave there and rent it from time to time.
Nicely orgenized has 2 bathrooms that include baths and toilets - this also makes ones stay very comfertable.
The internet access was good.
Frank welcomed us  and Jared was always availble online.

We highly recommend it and would love to come again."
21081966,249736594,2018-04-02,39044558,George,This place is outstanding and in the perfect location. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Toronto.

4424775,289158443,2018-07-11,4673174,Jana,We stayed at Ariane’s place for one week and we loved it! The apartment is in a great location with lots of bars restaurants a shops and just about 20 minutes (walk) from the beautiful beach and Lake Ontario. Perfect activity for sport lovers. We walked or ran there every morning. Ariane’s family is nice and kind the children are really cute. The room was clean and big enough. The private bathroom is just an other positive thing. When we come back to Toronto we will stay at Ariane’s place! Thank you ;-) 
14612745,529349662,2019-09-14,8348783,Brianna,Great place within 30 minute train ride to anywhere in the city. Ceilings are quite low but my partner is 6’3” and managed just fine. Loved all the personal touches and quick communication
18557039,289156556,2018-07-11,200205552,Luana,Exactly as it looks beautifully clean and a very nice location. Sunny was so accommodating texted back fast and personally met with us to show everything. The apartment is small but very beautiful and everything is a nice walk away. Would definitely rent again! :)
21405992,419228404,2019-03-03,213349818,Amanda,"I had a great stay at Soni and Suresh's place! 

First because the apartment is great: Large clean and equipped. There is Wifi and even a small TV with Netflix. There is a small office space to work if needed. The bed is large and the mattress very comfortable. Perfect to rest! The kitchen is well equipped. I especially enjoyed having some drinks in the fridge when I arrived but also enough coffee for the next day etc. Soni and Suresh have thought of every detail to make your stay enjoyable! The bathroom is clean and well laid out. It is also fully equipped when you arrived which is very pleasant: soaps shampoos shower gel towels … The apartment is well heated (appreciable in this winter period) and there is even a small electric heater provided just in case. The washing machine and dryer which are just next door are very convenient for a long stay. The apartment is also well located. There is a bus 2 min walk which allows to reach the warden subway station in 3min. And shops nearby. The neighborhood is very quiet and the house too. 

Then and above all it's Soni and Suresh who are great hosts! 
They were welcoming and then caring throughout my stay. I had announced an arrival around 9pm but due to bad weather my plane was late. I arrived after midnight and Soni and Suresh were waiting for me anyway! More than that they even came to help me with my luggage that I couldn't push alone on the snowy sidewalks! Seeing that I had not planned anything Soni even offered me something to eat in the evening and the next Morning. Suresh then accompanied me to show me where I could find grocery stores nearby! Throughout my stay Soni regularly texted me to make sure I had everything I needed. She was also very responsive to my text when I needed her and was always very understanding. At the end of my stay not only did they allow me to stay out of checkout time but without asking for anything Suresh even offered to help me join my next AirBnb.
I think I had a lot of luck meeting them. 

Soni Suresh thank you very much! :)"
18549087,182467080,2017-08-14,104240772,Leslie,Amazing condo we were very impressed!!!
32958299,557672331,2019-11-01,93164663,Hannah,My stay was so amazing. I knew nothing about Canada when I went and stumbled upon this place because it was in the location I needed looked clean and not to mention all the wonderful art touches. Didi was extremely helpful and responsive the whole time gave me suggestions on where to eat and gave me a little home to call my own. I cant wait to visit Toronto and stay in the art house again!
4601876,400319111,2019-01-11,58995384,Isabella,"best thing this place has going for it is the location which is great.  You will be asked to sign paperwork as a tenant.    This is not a proper two bathroom very strange setup.  furnishing are miss matched and in poor condition.  beds are jury rigged with 3 (old and lumpy) mattresses stacked and no boxspring.  very uncomfortable. owner did order a foam mattress pad after a complaint but this didn't address the lack of proper back support.  this was a problem for a 6 week stay.  no tv service  other than an antenna which provides  3 English speaking stations.  generally very cluttered up with poorly stored cleaning supplies and miscellaneous and not very useful ""spares"".  sorry but a basketof goodies on arrival does not a super host make."
35641861,539064749,2019-09-30,51510824,Niki,"This was not an Airbnb for us. A big house with 7 rooms on Airbnb is a business. 

We liked the room it was clean and big. 2 bathrooms was also a good point for these 7 rooms. 

For tourist as us who wanted to see the city it was a bit far from downtown. About an hour with the subway to go downtown. 

Otherwise the bed was confortable and the house in a calm neighborhood."
12799178,441007954,2019-04-21,38933250,Annette,Great location surprisingly quiet for the middle of town! Good value though some cleanliness issues.

19094099,291196033,2018-07-15,77613245,Victoria,Marie was a great host! Everything about this trip was perfect for my birthday.

He gave us a great suggestion to go Lula which is a fabulous salsa club with a live band. Also several great places to dine.The apartment was spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom is small and cozy. It was walking distance to the bus and street car's. It was also minuets away from many bars and restaurants in very hip area. We were able to take one street car to Kensington Market and China town. public Transportation was very easy and runs 24hrs a day. We had a great stay and would love to visit again.
39129227,569160764,2019-11-25,48246921,Lara,An extremely clean cozy and wonderful stay. Simona and her family are so inviting and kind. Extremely enjoyable spot in a great location in TO.

12007585,107964627,2016-10-13,79855636,Jan,"It felt like home from the first day on. 
We had a great time with James and all the other guests. James is a very gentle and generous guy always willing to help. 
The accommodation is located in one of the best parts of Toronto we never had to use a bus or subway. 
We stayed for three weeks and we will surely use the opportunity to book a room at james apartment whenever we come back again.

3290328,76324908,2016-05-26,72771151,Samantha,Awesome stay with Anya! The neighbourhood was lovely very safe convenient and vegan friendly! Anya's apartment and the room are beautiful but the best part was her! Super welcoming it was a mix of interesting conversation good coffee and the perfect amount of knowing when I wanted to do my own thing! Highly recommend for anyone wanting a clean affordable and (thankfully) air conditioned stay! 
16756260,202990306,2017-10-13,11424125,Christy,Loved the location!  The 504 streetcar was right down the street to take you directly downtown.  Hadi was very attentive and accommodated a late check in and a hair dryer emergency :). The place looks just like the photos!  Thanks for a great stay!

Keep in mind that the street gets noisy (and is audible in the apartment) on Friday and Saturday night but it was otherwise very peaceful. There are many cute cafes and restaurants nearby!

3315154,201582006,2017-10-08,71067538,Andres,"Great location great neighborhood great apartment. The apartment is just one block away from Parliament St. which has a number of stores and restaurants including and LCBO and a bank (just in case you need one or both). 
The neighborhood is wonderful. It's full of beautiful houses friendly people and it has a charming vibe.
The apartment was spacious and clean and the included parking space is great. Like any big city parking can be difficult if not impossible to find so having a guaranteed spot (just behind the back patio no less) is wonderful. It is a basement apartment with a tight spiral staircase leading down to it so maneuvering up and down said staircase can be challenging if you have say bad knees difficulty balancing or lack the requisite strength. There is no designated kitchen just a small area that includes a microwave utensils plates and bowls. There is also a Keurig coffee machine: The included coffee pods were a nice touch."

Just that the room is not as I was expected- the floor is not clean the towel is dirty I found somebody’s hairs all over it which was (Website hidden by Airbnb) the corner of the bed left someone’s socks with dust.

33277120,457259224,2019-05-23,80995855,Kyle,Great location and a fantastic view! The house gets plenty of sunlight and the balcony is really nice.
28219043,512593711,2019-08-18,121462175,Petra,"Wir waren sehr zufrieden die Lage ist  einmalig  allerdings muss man sich darauf einstellen dass es laut ist wegen der Nähe zum Highway. 
150 Meter zum Hafen 100 Meter zum Aquarium und CN Tower zentraler geht es also nicht.
Wohnung mit allem ausgestattet also sehr konfortabel.
Wir würden wieder dorthin gehen."
22083516,284507973,2018-07-01,127403157,Paddy,A great place to stay if you want to be in the thick of all the action.  Loads of good supermarkets nearby - high end stuff (and prices).  Noisy due to construction site/trains and traffic but no construction work at the weekends.  Very comfortable and a great location.  Alper very helpful at all times.
19432168,478164475,2019-06-29,138978265,Gisele,A estadia na casa no Petter foi perfeita ótima localização perto das principais Avenidas de toronto Dundas Bay shopping e bares a maioria dos lugares no centro conseguimos ir andando respostas rápidas as dúvidas o host super prestativo  indicamos estadia no local do Perder e se voltarmos para Toronto alugaríamos novamente!!!

1844121,138373760,2017-03-19,32114013,Matt,Amazing host your time here will be unforgettable.
33606701,500754070,2019-08-02,126538295,Meme,Johns place is really clean and perfect for cables stay if definitely go back there  worth the money nice view of the lake and the BMO field
5681246,334153774,2018-10-08,187869,Sarah,Beautiful home on a quiet lovely street. Tyrone was very accommodating by helping us print the parking pass and seemed eager to assist us in any way during our trip. Heavenly bed and shower! Gracious hosts with a beautiful home thank you!
19606512,175763850,2017-07-29,7378716,Paola,Lovely apartment very comfortable and super location with easy transit options to go everywhere else. 
37516294,530915060,2019-09-16,455772,Kelley & Jen,Nice cozy spot in central area . Very nice to have easy parking  private terrace  and was surprisingly quiet for such a busy location . Easy check in and host provided many comfort items not seen too often ( robes slippers  fruit  pastries etc) we would recommend and hope to return
18112815,338843556,2018-10-20,162572421,Courtney,Mar was very easy to get communicate with and made the check in process easy. The only comment I have would be re: the cleanliness (wasn’t super clean but definitely not dirty by any means) and the fire alarm went off twice in the middle of the night (although I know this is common for condos in the area). Overall the place is cute and cozy and pretty good value for the money.
22189094,423542118,2019-03-14,200183540,Tom,For me this was a great location as I had friends nearby. It is in a nice quiet neighborhood and being a bit outside of Toronto helps with that. Not too far from necessities and if you do require more shops there are busses subways and Uber nearby. The place itself was nice. Clean nice looking and a big comfy bed. Just be careful about the ceiling in the dark ;)
4719324,316107211,2018-08-30,52796676,Ben,Darya was a great host! Very quick to respond!  Everything was as described and a perfect location for seeing all the sights. Very walkable even with kids.

21081966,516574483,2019-08-24,2457039,Kelly,We loved our stay at Jerome's. Location is fantastic and we enjoyed walking around the area as well as the easy access to public transit from his location. I would definitely recommend it to visitors who plan to be out and about touring the city and all of it's wonderful attributes!
21065274,332141782,2018-10-04,62489390,Murphy,The house was clean and comfortable. Lots of snakes repaired for us. Well located.
18998606,324073095,2018-09-16,127423707,David,"I was in Toronto for a class reunion and I was looking for a central location. Lily and Jing’s place was perfect for my needs. It’s close to everything downtown and practically next door to the Rogers Centre Aquarium and CN Tower. 
Jing showed me where to park and gave me a quick overview of the apartment which was appreciated. The condo was clean and exactly as advertised and I was quite happy with my experience there. I would stay in this Airbnb again."
34511952,554500838,2019-10-26,44472422,Mia,Confortable condo  in a central location. Would book again.

23167228,471963391,2019-06-18,16037105,Maeghan,Perfect location right near Bloor subway station. Easy check in place was pretty spacious. Cute balcony off the kitchen bathroom is a bit small. Place had extra blankets and pillows. No air conditioning but if you leave the windows open you get a nice breeze. Overall I would stay again great value for money and location you can’t beat it.
26352715,422203543,2019-03-10,59999126,Lexi,Ann response very fast! Thank you for hosting us!
9495542,127026705,2017-01-15,93329586,Rodrigo,A hospedagem foi perfeita desde a nossa chegada até a saída. O basement é confortável bem equipado e com boa privacidade. Feela trabalha muito e fica pouco tempo em casa mas mesmo assim nos tratou muito bem sendo sempre uma pessoa muito agradável. A localização é ótima com metrô e linhas de ônibus bem próximas além de mercados e farmácias. Gostamos muito e esperamos ter oportunidade para voltar outras vezes.
23418598,359942677,2018-12-18,227898571,Alexandra,Perfect location and very timely responses!
27108691,440293476,2019-04-20,60066096,Gordon,Great home very clean and perfect hosts to communicate with.
14925943,159038613,2017-06-09,118756509,Amanda,Adeel was incredibly prompt and amicable in all communications. Since this was my first Airbnb experience and first time staying in Toronto the detailed maps and instructions for checking-in Adeel provided were helpful and greatly appreciated. The availability of Adeel via phone and email was great in addition to his thoughtful message during the stay to ensure everything was going well and to see if anything was needed. Overall Adeel and his studio exceeded my Airbnb expectations and made for a wonderful 5-night stay. The price for the stay was an absolute steal given the superb location amenities and the studio's overall look and feel. I highly recommend Adeel's space especially for anyone attending a conference at the Westin Harbour Castle which was a quick 5 minute walk from the studio. 
7075498,364876408,2018-12-31,7991621,Jennifer,This is an apartment-rental company masquerading as an AirBnB. Locations and prices are excellent but be aware that check-in is at a second downtown location during office hours only communication will be through an answering service and they don't provide even basic amenities such as bath soap or a second roll of toilet paper. This is a profit-first operation with no attention to the customer.
33074336,565657773,2019-11-17,304929029,Victoria,My friends and I really enjoyed staying at Mo’s place. The listing is centrally located in a safe downtown area with so many options for food drinks and entertainment within a 5 minute walk. The apartment was clean and the building was impressive. One side note that it’s a bit noisy at night- the noises from the surrounding night life made it tough for me to fall asleep as a light sleeper. Aside from that the only hiccup that occurred was that upon arrival my friends and I were confused about the location of the parking spot. However Mo answered my messages immediately and was really helpful.
19763098,321927140,2018-09-11,69538113,Shrey,"Great Host. Makes you feel like family. I ended up extending my stay by 2 days here instead of looking for another place and they happily let me. Very accommodating and very friendly. Did a ton of things to help me out.

If you’re coming in late make sure to let Ivan know in advance in the introductory message as he tends to accept offers really quickly and later gets mad at you for not telling him before he accepted."
30594050,558108094,2019-11-02,6959561,Sungwoo David,Great location and super clean!!
1510402,67910774,2016-04-01,30259423,Marie,"I stayed at this place during my first month in Toronto and am happy I could picked it up. Amy and Graeme are very friendly and helpful hosts. They showed me the neighbourhood and gave me valuable advice and tips. 
The room looks exactly as it is shown on the pictures; neighbourhood is pleasant safe easily reachable from both the airport and from the city center. And there are several nice cafes and pubs around also. 
I definitely recommend it! "
26746164,412099616,2019-02-14,301645,Mike,Yet another great stay at Elaine's place!!
23632672,302992389,2018-08-06,178269674,Lauren,Close to small shopping and restaurant area bus and metro shop. Amazingly nice hosts who have literally thought of everything. You won't regret staying here.

Le parking est un plus  on peut laisser la voiture et visiter la ville à pieds. 

"
21982595,466667759,2019-06-09,50688481,Nico,Jack's Airbnb is great!  Lovely backyard and sunny deck. Unbeatable location - the beach is just a few minutes walk away. You can see the lake from the front porch! Parking in driveway is very convenient. You can count on Jack to reply quickly to any questions. We would definitely stay here again.
27052799,413930038,2019-02-18,45449283,Josue,This is by far one of the most beautiful apartments that I have stayed in my life. The view of the city was outstanding and the modern furniture made the place an interior designer's dream
18112815,206948655,2017-10-27,156205956,Ashish,Nice private condo!!! Parking spot came in handy
24084277,546404827,2019-10-13,300591187,Teagan,Great location! Perfect for leaving your car and taking the subway to explore. The place is so cute and cozy!
29593171,473398015,2019-06-21,101867290,Lyndsay,Check in was easy and the communication was great!  We ended up traveling in on the day of the Raptors parade and they we quick to send us all the road closures.  Location is good quick 10-15 min walk to all the good restaurants in downtown.  The building is a high rise and although the views are amazing waiting fro the 3 elevators the building has is not.  The apartment itself was clean my only two callouts would be the bedroom rugs although clean were stained and a little unsightly and the towels (which they are very quick to ask you not to soil) are a little rough.  Overall excellent experience and would stay here again!
13084226,149719568,2017-05-05,4186682,Aldo,Joanne's apartment is beautiful as seen in the photographs. It is away from the center enough to spend a quiet night but at the same time it is a few steps from the subway which connects you easily with any place in Toronto. The apartment was clean and even offer some amenities. Of course I would return in the future.
35540690,531444370,2019-09-17,211110506,Hellen,The apartment is great. Very spacious and clean. The view is beautiful! Darnell was also a great host. He gives very detailed instructions and is quick to respond. My family and I were very pleased with everything. I would definitely recommend staying here.
10835701,93047971,2016-08-11,74203210,Julien,Easy and simple check-in and check-out. Room is as described and shown on the pictures and from a good walkable distance from the major attractions in town. Couldn't find any blankets for the sofa-bed and since it was late we didn't bother David. I guess if you plan to use the second bed make sure to request more blankets. Otherwise everything was perfect!
5629942,319192453,2018-09-05,30071658,Tina,Had a good stay wonderful view great location close to Rogers Centre CN tower restaurants St. Lawrence Market. We had a short stay so location was very helpful would have loved to take advantage of the pool or other amenities in the building if we had more time.  Convenient to have parking.  Anton was responsive and sent detailed check in instructions. Would stay again.
7951517,63355807,2016-02-22,48698103,Melissa,The host canceled this reservation 116 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13527303,281759191,2018-06-25,25240829,Danielle,Great location safe neighborhood with plenty of street parking (need to pay for permit but was an easy process...).  Easy commute into the city and walkable to beaches/stores etc. James is very responsive. Only regret is that the BR had a little mold in the shower and the kitchen needs more counter space (but it is as pictured!) Overall I was happy with our stay.
21150160,320995856,2018-09-09,171216776,Leah,Beautiful place. Super clean with cute little finishing touches. Prime location on Yorkville and directly above STK. Ela is a fabulous host. Quick responses and always super helpful. 10/10. Will definitely be back in the near future. Thank you Ela!

10287803,166187438,2017-07-02,25797306,Daniela,My husband and I came to Toronto for a vacation. The location was perfect for us. It was close to everything. We were able to walk almost everywhere. Check in was easy and so was communication with Wayne. I highly recommend!

31242824,428081228,2019-03-24,38668890,Kristina,Cinders was a great host the space was super cute and had everything we needed for the night!
16087849,503235773,2019-08-05,176596649,Michelle,Zak’s place was very easy to check in to. Everything he leaves an instruction to and you really don’t need to contact him unless it’s something major. He literally sets you up to not have any issues while you’re there. Location is perfect! Gym and pool is a bonus on top of free parking. And for those who don’t drive catching a Lyft or Uber is faster than I’ve ever experienced.
17682332,260994691,2018-05-05,9748977,Simge,"NEGATIVE: unfortunately That room is very noisy to have a peaceful stay. we were hearing continuously the door lock till lates and we were hearing all guests around the entrance and kitchen. We were woke up several times during nights and morning by other guests. Not good !...
OBSERVATION: The house weren' t like Airbnb house which has no interaction no communication with no one but much more like a HOSTEL.  Just a bit more comfort on it. it was really sad to stay but someone can prefer it.
POSITIVE: Clean well organized. The room itself is like in the pictures. 
Good and Super fast communication with hosts good checking -  check out instruction. Great location. 
This room in this house would not recommend... maybe other rooms are better ?!"

28464826,484773342,2019-07-09,20450182,Livija,Our group of 11 family members enjoyed this comfortable and clean house. The neighborhood is well-kept clean and safe.  Good parking. The host provided coffee tea water bottles bananas and bread were very appreciated.  The house is a bit away from city center so guests should plan to get familiar with the transit system.
24034669,466764931,2019-06-09,129629688,Sabrina,Most deff would recommend this location
75051,1229864,2012-05-05,1395614,Eric,Sandra is an excellent host and the other reason I continue to come back is that everything you could ever think of needing is provided even a stack of games a croquet set as well as bocci balls. The location is perfect walking disance to shops and public transport. It's just the perfect pllace! Thanks again Sandra! 
18389561,275200705,2018-06-10,45210590,Jonathan,Kris was an amazing host. He gave me life advice travel tips local tips free water free coffee and even a gift for visiting and cause it was my bday!!

13224752,173681687,2017-07-23,5655641,Tanya,Small and quaint the accommodations were exactly as described and suited our needs which were basically to keep our drinks cold and to lay down our heads to rest! No more than 2 people will fit in Unit B trust me! Summer and her husband are nice hosts; not intrusive but they are available should you require anything.
24493089,431110689,2019-03-31,34611574,Nancy,This accommodation in the heart of Toronto is a delight.  It is beautifully furnished with a spectacular view comfortable livable and enjoyable.  The sheets and towels are of high quality the kitchen well stocked for cooking and the appliances of top-quality.  The host responded to our many questions in a timely manner and provided extra bedding and an inflatable mattress for extra guests.  His instructions for checking in and out were very clear.

19491048,233015881,2018-02-07,55468965,Patricia,This airbnb is just as the site states. AJ is a very responsive host. In addition the airbnb was supplied with thoughtful additions such as milk eggs and butter in the fridge.  It is perfect for conferences at Beanfield center.  The beds are comfortable the bathrooms are sparkling clean. The gym facilities are good. It is very close to public transport. I highly recommend AJ's place.

Great for all people looking for good place to stay and pay less"
28741119,455357590,2019-05-19,99560069,Jimmy,This place was awesome. We had 8 of us and everyone loved it and had a great time. Everyone was able to sleep comfortably. Enough linens and towels for everyone. Place was clean and nicely furnished and decorated. Location wasn’t bad. About a 10-15 ride to downtown but only blocks from bars and restaurants. Chui Yi was very attentive and answered any questions I had in a timely manner. I would definitely stay here again.
17847665,200478064,2017-10-05,106844844,Danielle,This place is everything that could have been expected and more. Myself and 7 of my friends came to Toronto for a fun night out. Kat and her partner Farid were amazing hosts extremely helpful and always replying quick whenever we needed anything. They were both super chill so as long you and your group follow their simple rules you will have a great stay. We will definitely be back again!
9975236,290556016,2018-07-14,188936763,Trista,Close to everything! CN tower hockey hall of fame aquarium harbor to toronto island . All walking distance 10 to 15 minutes. If in the area will stay again
1641240,86179383,2016-07-15,9198395,Gaurav,A very tastefully done apartment in a great location in downtown Toronto. 5min walk to Metro convention centre 10 mins to Union station / Air Canada centre and with lots of shopping and eating options close by. Had no problems whatsoever during my stay. 
17302790,480790419,2019-07-03,21874862,Judith,The appartment is location in a quite street with lost of shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood. It is beautifuly decorated and has everything you need for a few days in the city. Erin is very hospitable and makes you feel at home right away.
20826348,318418563,2018-09-03,30579129,Melody,"Indra is very sweet and really accomodating. We were in TO to see the air show and she let us park our car at her place before the check-in time and checking-in was super easy!

There was little attentions in the appartment: treats in the kitchen and fresh water bottle in the fridge. Cleaning was done every day.

The appartment is located along a highway which is easy to go downtown Toronto either by car or streetcar. 

However we had one of the hottest week-end of the summer and had a hard time sleeping because there was no air conditionning. There is also 2 dehumidifiers which we had to empty every couple hours (even during the night) because the appartment is in a basement and it is really humid.

Also the mattress was too soft we were rolling to the middle of the bed. I’ve discussed that point with Indra and even if she added a top foam on the mattress we suggest that buying a new one may be a good solution.

Overall we had a great week-end and thanks a lot Indra for your hospitality!"
6277844,33312738,2015-05-26,27510943,Jason (Junsang),Her place was very fantastic. Her house has lovely interior and decorations. She was very kind very nice and very cool. She recommended where to visit and which retaurant to go. She provided us a wonderful breakfast. Her hosting would be the most memorable part of out trips in Toronto.
16195283,260978557,2018-05-05,60831930,Han,We had a great stay at Sisi and Jhon place. They gave us very clear instructions full of information and provided everything you need during your stay. The place was clean and organised. The view is awesome and location is convenient. Will stay again!
9756835,307083209,2018-08-13,87140410,Isabelle,Appartement super propre dans un voisinage super tranquille dans un décor super beau et a quelques coins de rues d'un metro. Pour résumer c'était super!
19870812,291970160,2018-07-16,125960366,Carlo,L'appartamento è in una zona con molto ricca di locali aperti fino a sera molto adatti a persone giovani. Dall'appartamento molto ben collegato con i mezzi pubblici si ha una bella vista del parco e dello skiline del resto di Toronto.  Chiara ci ha accolto molto calorosamente dandoci molte informazioni sui locali e sulle cose da vedere in giro.
17160679,331018456,2018-10-01,6194923,Oceane,Nice location includes everything you need (it's labelled with your bedroom number in the kitchen). Mostly clean (what wasn't was because of the other guests). We highly recommend it!
21831039,226223420,2018-01-09,530017,Angel,"This place is perfect for any business person/executive that needs temporary accommodations. It comes with a small office that contains a nice ergonomic workspace with multiple monitors that I could just plug into and immediately be productive.  Personally this is what made the unit absolutely great.

It has an excellent view of Toronto a very comfortable king-size bed and a kitchen with full amenities.

Overall I could not have asked for better – although it would've been nice to have access to the fitness center. I'm sure the host will make adjustments in the future to ensure that guests have access to the gym."
12042727,334267317,2018-10-08,27374553,Kelley,Beautiful home in great location!   Very gracious owners with super fast and friendly communications. We loved it and highly recommend!

36808844,545100234,2019-10-11,130682403,Nichola,"Michael's place is amazing - you will probably get the best view in Toronto here. Our group was blown away by the location and the interior of the condo. Communication was amazing and the space was very clean. 

Would definitely book again!"
4838440,317739480,2018-09-02,1009355,Danny,Amazing hospitality easy communication with Adam and he really went above and beyond to help with our schedule.
31898846,452675682,2019-05-13,213788239,Alondra,My sister and I were in town for TCAF and we trusted Aisha to provide us a hospitable stay. Aisha exceeded our expectations and provided a full kitchen comfortable beds TV and a laundry space. The whole space was sparkling clean and we felt right at home.   Although we were sight seeing Toronto for most of our four night stay we felt at ease knowing that we had a place to wind-down afterwards.  Aisha checked on us frequently and was able to answer questions as soon as possible. I'm really glad that we decided to stay at Aisha's place and I would love to return again. I highly recommend booking with Aisha!
15271092,412867168,2019-02-16,219965506,Teodora,Great place if you like privacy with just a little bit of company. Everything is provided (including shampoo) and it’s very clean. Sadly I couldn’t find a toaster or microwave but you do get a small fridge free tea/coffee and the stove is convenient. The host replies quickly and is very hospitable though I personally only saw her a couple of days. Overall great place close to everything don’t be fooled by the way it looks from the outside!
15774267,566097503,2019-11-18,36660656,Cielo,Cuenta con todos los servicios. La relación precio-calidad muy bien. Es tal cual lo que ofrece. Está ubicado en un barrio tranquilo. Hay una plaza comercial / mall que incluye un walmart a 15-20 minutos caminando.
18791219,246910557,2018-03-26,34014563,Marcie,Sheri is a very helpful host. Her place is super nice! I really love it very much.
13370172,135821856,2017-03-06,112416415,Kimberley,A cozy space complete with a kitchen and bathroom. Also a ton of ameneties included to ensure that your stay is comfortable. Connie is a wonderful host and was incredibly helpful. The neighbourhood itself is quiet and in the heart of Greektown which is lined with shops and restaurants for you to pop in if you wanted to try something new. Steps away from two subway entrances (Pape and Donlands) it was easy to get to the Downtown core without too much trouble. 10/10 would recommend!
13532029,522701218,2019-09-02,59393952,Jason,Great stay. Clean comfortable place. Hosts were easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Highly recommended!

19798087,236878013,2018-02-20,135384798,Tito,Charlene’s place is spectacular and I will agree with a review below that the photos here do not do the space justice. From the modern kitchen beautiful bathroom (that rain shower!) spacious living room and lovely natural light throughout to the awesome neighborhood it’s nestled in that features some really amazing restaurants this apartment is more-than-wonderful. Can’t say enough great things about it along with Charlene who was such an accommodating host. Would really love to stay here again in the future.
35682640,532362759,2019-09-19,52994255,Hélène,"The apartment is very tiny but clean. The communication is easy. 
The entrance is very very narrow with stiff stairs so It may be complicated with a big suitcase. 
Turn the ventilation on otherwise it smells humidity"
21868557,225828997,2018-01-07,25006114,Chloé,La chambre était parfaite pour quelques nuits
21327987,212193727,2017-11-16,99417244,Dash,"Doesn't get any better than this. I've found my new go-to spot in Toronto. Amazing unit in a great building steps from the Rogers Centre. 
Dale is a great host. Check in was very easy at the key drop at the corner store. Dale was very quick to respond when I had a question about the tv (which is HUGE and nice) and he was very friendly and helpful. 
The balcony is nice and private too. Great view. Everything was super comfortable. Only wish I had booked a longer stay!

The internet was a good speed too. 40Mbps down and 30Mbps up when I tested. Great for gaming on the nice big Samsung tv. No walmart brand here!

Top notch listing. Thanks Dale!"
4881531,80914211,2016-06-20,1971302,Michelle,Checked in super late but it was no problem Aleef was there waiting to hand me over the keys.  Place is exactly as described location couldn't be beat! Will definitely stay here again! 
37782336,547082184,2019-10-14,296679235,Vincent,Super emplacement !
31041783,512565990,2019-08-18,20017361,Keesha,"Cleanliness was a lack. I had to wash my own dishes before using them. Bathroom was not clean had to mop the floor because the floor was dirty when we arrived. Washed towels and sheets were left in the washer machine. So I had to wash my own laundry and they did not have any detergent. Overall was not happy with cleanliness. One of the major reasons I decided to book this place because there was a 
""pool"". I had messaged the host even asking which they confirmed it did but did not mention it was in construction. The balcony space is very narrow. The view of the CN Tower is not even their picture."
19825694,364397350,2018-12-30,2403748,Brandt,Very good value for money.
29988364,455972195,2019-05-20,95581297,Samantha,This was my very first time staying at an AirBnB. I am impressed!! Cute little touch with the Jolly ranchers on the information sheet!! 
18024250,219501466,2017-12-17,112598029,Siqian,Great location and amazing place!
12836500,538985722,2019-09-30,43292441,Roxanne,A friend and I only stayed in Azin place for one night but it was very comfortable and convenient.
5025880,80467948,2016-06-18,45830708,Trisha,This was our first Air BnB experience and I have to say that Lina and Paul have set a very high standard. Communication prior to our stay was excellent. Paul met us at the station and Lina took us shopping for groceries beer and wine. They recommended a lovely restaurant for our first night and drove us there. This was very much appreciated as we had flown in from the UK and were  both very tired. Throughout our stay  we felt very much at ease and were made to feel most welcome by this friendly and thoughtful couple.The studio apartment was spotlessly clean and had a kitchenette and private bathroom. The studio was very private but Paul and Lina were on hand whenever needed. The weather was beautiful while we were there so we made good use of the lovely pool and garden. There is also an area to sit out and eat and we used the BBQ on the last evening. Situated less than 10 minutes from the GO station it was easy to get downtown with trains running every half an hour. We would highly recommend Paul and Lina as hosts.
3332077,22229186,2014-11-02,19591366,Jessica,Jelena and Carlos's apartment is very cosy and comfortable it had everything that we needed and was lovely and clean and welcoming. We really enjoyed staying there and it was a great base for getting around Toronto. 
21702224,426308355,2019-03-20,81697887,Angela,Cindy’s space is in perfect location. Just a short walk to St Laurence market and restaurants. It is nice it has parking spot as well. Me and my friends stayed for a training and we chose the space because it has kitchen where we can prepare our food. But unfortunately there’s not enough cutlery for us. We have to share spoons and forks for us to eat our meal. The trash can was an issue as well. We have a compost bin in the bathroom and the bag in the trash can by the kitchen does not fit. The power room and shower room is separated as well which is great but the doors were broken and the sink in the powder room is clogged with stagnant water in it which she is aware of it but did not give us a heads up and she just called after we are already in the unit and says she will have someone fix it but never did. The directions finding the parking is rather confusing but able to manage to find it. The covers could be better for every hair sticks on it . It could have been a perfect space. Hopefully this is something they could fix in the future
4510872,553586957,2019-10-24,171449243,Ozaawaa,Good space. Clean. Great location. I’d stay here again.
15497982,148256003,2017-04-30,68275792,Stephanie, We had a great time. Johnny recommended some great restaurants. The view here is fantastic everything is as advertised and  there was so much to do in walking distance. We enjoyed ourselves and would definitely stay there again. 
11720805,304427079,2018-08-09,19158687,Merritt,great place!
20620905,495746702,2019-07-26,233193762,Catherine,Very good communication!
29862424,547056517,2019-10-14,181941267,Charles,"It was really easy to get access to the streetcars to head downtown and the area itself is close to a lot of green space and up and coming shops.

Keep in mind that this is a shared room."
18037900,503289637,2019-08-05,184238527,Samuel,Small but exactly as described!! Perfect for a vacation where you’re juste at the appartment to sleep
7307503,83833359,2016-07-04,33153983,Rick,Linda was very nice felt very welcomed
6349559,122151658,2016-12-21,29899350,Rob,Sabah was a great host. Clean and modern one -bedroom within walking distance of a ton of great Toronto attractions. Thoroughly answered any questions I had about check in/out and parking. A+ would absolutely stay again.
1945120,87373000,2016-07-19,64579615,Shuo,The neighbourhood is very safe and quite close to many things. The room is comfortable with everything you might need with a separate private washroom. Gg and Archers are warmhearted caring and hospitable. I enjoyed my stay there. Highly recommended.
13605154,126996705,2017-01-15,83202875,Stevie,Olga's place is everything it says we had a great time and would go back at a drop of a hat thanks Olga 
19662741,194029186,2017-09-15,18361896,Victoria,Helen was a great host! The building was doing routine maintenance but Helen was on top of it with communication. Great location! The home definitely has a few nicks and scratches from wear and tear but overall very clean and had all the amenities in there that you'll need. Instructions are very clear. The parkade is a little bit of a mine field but once you go through it a few times it's reasonable. In the parkade there are two buildings linked to the same parkade so follow Helen's instruction to go to the entrance that is closest to the parking stall 29 to find the right entrance. Overall great stay!

1382277,350547771,2018-11-19,11615169,Anika,Cristina’s place was very nice spacious and unique! Very beautiful during the daytime with the sunshine bursting through (although it does interrupt sleep due some blinds not working). The location is great very close to downtown highways and East York. Lots of great eateries around the area as well. Cristina was very helpful in answering all questions.

27551245,469976368,2019-06-15,19457066,Killashandra,We had a brief but pleasant stay at Madeleine's. She was really responsive to questions and check in/out was smooth. Her flat was very comfortable and the location  is brilliant for exploring Toronto.
4565516,141550588,2017-04-03,100398318,Jodi,This is a great location central to everything! My husband and I were able to walk everywhere.  The security was very good on the building and it was convenient to be able to park in the underground parking as well! The condo is very cute and nicely decorated.  I loved the memory foam bed! We also enjoyed having the balcony!! 
24911265,324657896,2018-09-17,211685767,Odaine,The host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

32381906,443727310,2019-04-26,86799369,Diah,I definitely will reccomend this place. This is basically and inn with homy touch. I felt like home and like the interior. The neighbourhood is also good as it is in residential area quiet and nice. I like this place.

One big problem that made us feel very uncomfortable however is that the property does not permit AirBnB's."
23030613,513559074,2019-08-19,238729862,Matteo,Just amazing! I went there with my family and everyone was very happy about the apartment very clean stylish close to the center and the station. I definetly recommend it!
27582013,527752836,2019-09-11,242573862,Candace,I wouldn’t rent here! We were terribly disappointed. There was black mold in the shower and the baseboards by the bed were filthy dirty. The pillows were very old and lumpy. You have to go down very steep narrow stairs that turn to the left. With no handrail. The suite is at the opposite side of the house. There are no egress windows ( window is 18.5x20” ) and it is blocked by a tree even if you could wiggle through it. No fire extinguisher. We felt it was a fire trap very dirty and it had an off putting odour in it.
15853135,197968399,2017-09-27,80465869,Abhay,Five star setup for a decent price. It is a steal.
6406028,280185676,2018-06-22,8152581,Danielle,Elaine & Greg's place is a nice place to stay and I highly recommend it for a great budget-conscious stay. They both very very lovely and everyone I met was super nice! Have a great short time with them.

It was perfectly clean and our host answered very quickly when we asked for the heat to be turned up."

I really enjoyed this hip neighbourhood on the weekend and during the week was easily able to get downtown for work.
18072185,292682403,2018-07-18,90123016,Jessica,This was my first time staying in an airbnb so I was a little sceptical but this place is great! Everyone was friendly so I felt right at home. It had everything I needed and it felt very secure. Definitely recommend! 
8077,1796126,2012-07-25,36786,Collin & Nandi,"Our second time staying with Kathie and Larry. They are very friendly hosts. They offer some nice extra touches like a bottle of filtered water and a clear information card in the room.

Be sure to check out the view from the roof deck it's pretty incredible. Look out for the view of Toronto Islands during the day and the CN tower at night.

Very comfortable bed."

4240983,39452064,2015-07-23,7077021,Tamara Hope,What a breath of fresh air this gem was indeed! I've stayed in a numerous amount of accommodations world wide hotels airbnb bnbs hostels home away from home but this flat takes the cake! You feel at home from the moment you walk up to your door sets everything about this place in inviting! The fresh ground coffee and homemade granola are over the top and speaks to the generous person your host Abigail will be throughout your stay. Abi was terrific very prompt to get back to us with any questions we had during our stay she even granted our request to arrive an house earlier!  Having lived practically next door for over 6 years you'll be delighted with all this neighbourhood has to offer as well! Great pubs diverse dinning options and super amazing cafés all around. My husband and I look forward to staying at this flat again sometime soon! 
23277408,514151099,2019-08-20,283995737,Rachel,This was such a great place stay. It was so clean affordable and beautiful. Lulu was very great communication wise and we enjoyed her as our host. This made the trip so much better coming back to such a nice place.

11168201,499528396,2019-07-31,65828403,Valery,Stayed for a month; really enjoyed the area and appreciated the host's excellent communication and thoughtfulness. The place was also tidy and very comfortable.
13826293,93120111,2016-08-11,2500870,Amos,My stay was too short but it helped to be a short stroll from the restaurants / cafes of Queen Street West & Dundas Street West.  Donnie's place was spotlessly clean and nicely air conditioned.  The room was a good size and had its own en suite. Check-in instructions were a breeze.  I only saw Donnie in the morning but he was friendly and helpful.  Good coffee from White Squirrel Cafe opposite Trinity Bellwoods Park; good gelato and cakes from Sud Forno; excellent southern BBQ at Smoque 'N Bones; and wonderful ceviche at Bent.  Enjoy!
23924383,337554109,2018-10-16,108550147,Molly,There is just one bedroom but the space worked fine for our group of 7 for the 2 nights we stayed. Great location

23823207,302402112,2018-08-05,196413970,Rob & Hanneke,Roger and Alice are wonderful hosts. They gave us a warm welcome and they were always willing to answer our questions we had. Parking in front of their house is not allowed however Roger recommended to park at next to Landsdown subway station. This is a municipal parking lot we paid for two full days as we bought a weekend pass to travel by subway. Roger and Alice also offer the use of their washing machine and dryer this is an excellent service. The room is spotless.

24971304,466669963,2019-06-09,85964899,Hrishikesh,"I had a great time staying here. Although I couldn’t meet Cherry which I would have loved to her husband James was a very helpful person and always smiling. I would certainly book here again if I am ever going to go to Scarborough to stay.
However I think it’s better if they took extra care to keep the bathroom cleaner and made sure it also smells good. A few extra things such as these would only make the guest feel welcome and being looked after."

15097290,221182430,2017-12-25,119450614,Bella,"John and Jinja are a very warm fun accommodating couple. I felt at home as soon as I walked in the door. The big bright room is as is in the pictures. It is well furnished. The space is clean and I love the decor. It speaks of people who travel. The bathroom is very clean and the little touches of colour add life to the room. It is basically a bachelor minus the kitchen. If you are looking to go somewhere in the city with your own space to just have a change of scenery I totally recommend it. Be it a little to simply write a novel read books be lazy go for it. I shall definitely go visit again and keep in touch with them. They  made my first Christmas in Toronto truly memorable. 

Thanks J&J"
7003701,168557569,2017-07-09,8077631,Bonnie,Ahmad's place has a beautiful welcoming atmosphere and is located in a fantastic part of town near shops restaurants and parks. Ahmad was super easy to communicate with and responded very quickly to questions. The plants artwork and well-curated lights were very happy-making. Definitely recommend :)
960627,13556024,2014-05-30,13103103,Effie,This place was exactly what we were looking for: a clean place to sleep close to the downtown core as we explored the city. Brahm also met us at the apartment when we arrived and helped get us oriented and was willing to let us leave our luggage there even after checkout which was much appreciated
31152671,560685619,2019-11-07,303884592,Irina,"Great little private space! Located two minutes away from bus stops small convenience and grocery stores as well as a pharmacy (privately owned ones the only downside being they have a small selection and close early). The basement unit was fully equipped - stovesinkfridge iron/ board coffee machine (w/coffee!) towels shampoo TV (bring an hdmi cable if you need to connect a laptop). The host introduced themselves kindly without invading - they reside right upstairs so standard considerations for ""quality of life"" reasons are to be expected (like keeping the chatter/sound down after ~10pm). Overall impressed and recommended."

14715527,337219233,2018-10-15,207131239,Siddharth,Coreen for us was family away from family. She is very welcoming towards the guests and also helps in every way possible. The best host and the best place I have been to. Thanks Coreen!
31470612,434366073,2019-04-07,5197957,Taryn,The apartment was very clean and Rory and Alita were very friendly and welcoming. We felt at home here and it was a great location - 5 minute walk to Subway and located in nice area of Toronto. Also for a basement apartment it was cozy and warm which we appreciated especially since we were travelling with a toddler.
25066463,344059081,2018-11-02,218438409,Lildonia,"I had a great time staying at Heathers. The room was cosy clean and tidy and I loved the additional gym space. Breakfast and refreshments were topped up daily and Heather was super flexible and helpful. 

The area was family friendly but also trendy and easy access to downtown."
35379698,528750245,2019-09-13,129213484,Laura,The place is close to the public transportation in a quit locality nice and clean. The staff at the reception is very nice and ready to help or just chat with you if you feel like doing it. There is always good coffee available downstairs at the caffeteria and it is also available in the room together with refrigerated water and some soda. My only problem was the fact that windows cannot be open and the airconditioning is very noisy and not working properly. We Europeans prefer to open the window when it is nice outside instead of trying to get a filtered air of proper quality and temperature. :-)

14471456,206024265,2017-10-23,46649559,Michael,I chose Lp’s place as an affordable option for a quick one-night stay. As a solo traveler I felt completely safe and comfortable in the neighborhood and the space itself. The unit was very clean the bed was comfortable and there is more than enough space for a comfortable stay. If you have a car there is an easy and accessible lot within a short walk from the unit off Margueretta St. that offers mobile pay and mobile time extension if needed. This would be an alternative if you happen to forget to print a street parking pass as Lp suggests doing. Overall: great stay!

19891685,260995172,2018-05-05,21559743,Òscar,Robyn's place is one of the best Airbnbs apartments where we have been on Airbnb. Also she and her partner were very good hosts and solved all the small problems that appeared.Definitely if we come back to Toronto we will stay in Robyn's place.

20014026,526069043,2019-09-08,223442378,Maria Daniella,Our stay was amazing! We loved how clean and cute this space was. It was perfect for two couples and we loved having our own TVs to have a chance to spend time separate. One of our favourite parts was the shower super nice. We also loved all the instructions and reminders around the house it made it very clear what goes and what doesn’t. We also loved the back patio with a great view. We didn’t get to enjoy it much but definitely would have loved to spend more time out there. We also got to use the kitchen for breakfast and they had all the essentials which made it a breeze. Loved it lots!
31517226,495300952,2019-07-25,273559312,Sopiyatra,ashy's home was a wonderful experience. She is a very nice host who does her best to ensure the satisfaction of her guests.

While I didn't see the host during our stay it didn't matter everything was great. Very clean with own bathroom and comfy bed with beautiful linen. A lounge with some cable TV options were luxuries. 
Only thing that could make it better would be a little fridge. 
Neighborhood is pleasant with Coxwell subway an easy 5-10mim walk. 
Recommend."

Mark made sure that we have what we need and he provided us with booklet that has every thing we need to know about the house and the Neighborhood. 

My only concern that the house was full of nice and beautiful stuff that can easily be broken so I was worried most of the time that one of the children could break something.  "

19156653,499524241,2019-07-31,32928203,Lauri,Location location location!!  You can walk to many places.  We stayed for eight nights and it was a good value.  It was a bit hard to get into and since Matt was in France he was unable to help when issues arose.  Wish he had someone in Toronto to help when issues arose such as clogged sinks no internet and troubles getting into the apartment.  Furniture is comfortable but worn.  Our stay was comfortable overall.
23979609,502435736,2019-08-04,162714984,Iesha,I got a call from Chris prior to arrival . It was very pleasant and thoughtful. She have me contact info to reach her quicker than the air bnb website . The instructions for check In made it very easy . The place was clean and stylish. However there is no toaster. We had to heat the bagels in the oven . Otherwise Chris is an awesome host and has a awesome place . Very close to experience Toronto!
24857151,522101766,2019-09-01,16609827,Alejandro,"The location and the amenities are really good. I think quality/price of this place is in another level.

At our stay we found really convenient the parking space in downtown Toronto because there ain't to many options with this benefit. Also it is a great location to use the public transportation because there is a metro and tram station just a couple of meters from the apartment.

Also the place is super clean and with an amazing view of Toronto area. The room is enough for a couple and the private restroom is really a great asset.

We enjoyed our time in Toronto and definitely we will decide to come back."

5959077,452201909,2019-05-12,99067536,Hugo,"Well priced for a downtown appartment with a fantastic view!

However as others have mentioned the apartment is in need of some love! It really needs to have some money put back into it and it's clear its a money making venture.

Got stuck in elevator #2 the locals said it had been having issues for while. An outdoor garden plant had blown over and soil was spread around on the balcony with the wind and rain it had covered the windows. So they required cleaning to have the benefit of the view. Blinds most definitely need replacing I like others continued attempting repairs. The furniture is basic.

Again great view and the price is what it is for a reason. Had a comfortable weekend stay."
13661927,343130856,2018-10-30,5327945,Mohammad,We enjoyed staying at Sunny's place. We had a smooth check-in and we had a short walk around showing the neighborhood :).

Despite being a basement there is a reasonable amount of sunlight coming in plus the lights inside the apartments are positioned in a way that makes the place as bright as possible. The place is very clean and well maintained the linens were as clean as possible. There is everything you may need in the kitchen and more. If you are a coffee addicted as I am you will love to know that you'll have a coffee machine and a coffee grinder at your disposal. Danny is an amazing and lovely person every time I needed something he was ready to help including when I had just arrived in Toronto and needed someone to talk with. Highly recommended.

This was our second stay at Tony's and we'll definitely be back!"
4687194,78056952,2016-06-05,6341870,Nazanin,Don is a great host and his house is lovely. When visiting Toronto we usually stay downtown but wanted something with better/quicker access to the 401 so we stayed here. It's a lovely spacious house and my kids (1 and 5) loved it. My 5 year old is asking us to go back. The koi pond and solarium are a lovely spot in the house to just hang out. The place was impeccably clean and Don was very accomodating and easy to contact. There's a lovely park with a splash pad and tonnes of space for kids to expel energy within a 5 minute walk of the house which we took advantage of.

The location itself was quiet and peaceful with nice access through public transportation to getting you to Downtown Toronto though still about a 20-30 minute commute or so.

15917764,260643751,2018-05-04,120494093,Marc,Ich verfasse so gut wie nie Bewertungen aber dieses Apartment hat es mehr als verdient. Ich habe in Toronto gelebt und bin immer wieder dort -- diese Unterkunft war mit Abstand die beste die ich je in Toronto hatte. Die Angaben in der Beschreibung können der Liebe zum Detail und unglaublich üppigen Ausstattung kaum vernünftig Rechnung tragen. Hier passt einfach alles. Ich weiß jedenfalls wo ich in Toronto in Zukunft übernachten  (oder zumindest zuerst anfragen) werde.
10205625,69251556,2016-04-10,6452431,Cat,Suzanna's place was great! She was very warm and welcoming to our family. Exceeded expectations by stocking the fridge with essentials! Very smooth and seamless experience. Location is excellent too. Everything was superb.

19862765,283343365,2018-06-29,47850444,Joseph,"The good and the bad. 

First the good! The best part of this accommodation is the host Hospitality! Some of the best I have experienced on Airbnb. I missed my connecting flight and came in later than expected but she was available and responsive when I arrived at midnight on a Tuesday and even chatting with me while I waited for hours in the airport. The checkin process is fully automated and for being a shared house I didn’t see a single person in the 3 days I was there. It is all silo’ed pretty well. The location is also great. Very close to king St and the markets. 

The bad
This is a no frills accommodation. The bed is a 4” foam pad on a piece of plywood. There is no iron or hair dryer. I’m sure they will update these items so the next person will have it better. The last two are minor items. "
9586519,288778920,2018-07-10,55574320,Erik,"Was perfect for getting me started in Toronto.
Christina helped me out where she could and was very hospitable."

Doliina always made sure we were happy well taken of and always answered very quickly if needed. We highly recommend her place. We will be back! Thank you for the great stay!
27549705,507533716,2019-08-11,195517370,Max,Great place to stay at Toronto. The room and bathroom are clean and host is very nice.
13031045,354945239,2018-12-02,65821662,Jamie,"Overall stay was good. I recommend staying there for a maximum of 2 nights because it’s really basic and only has the BASIC necessities. 

Only downfall is that the washroom needs a GOOD SCRUB because the curtain looked so mouldy and the shower head was rusty. The towels were also folded for way too long because it had a very strong odour of musk.. 

Parking was a bit of a problem because when we arrived we did not have our parking spot and we had to park and block the entrance. Natasha was very good at communicating with us and made sure we were still able to park."

5006252,47719368,2015-09-21,20533903,Jonathan,Neema was an excellent host  lines of communication were always easy finding the place and getting in also no problem. Very nice information binder with snacks left for us (even fresh fruit!!) Upon reading an older review that says she doesn't have a coffee maker I can assure you that she does! Awesome neighbourhood close to everything you would ever need. Would definitely stay here again!
29861027,473978911,2019-06-22,106899162,Andrea,The room is clean and the host is very helpful and ready to solve problems. I asked to change the mattress and it was done promptly.  Public transport is close and frequent. Overall a good stay.
20070052,484832208,2019-07-09,18728167,Elijah,Yuri and Katie’s place was perfect during our week long trip in Toronto! It was in a great location walkable part of town and really close the trolleys in the area. The apartment had everything we needed they recommended great local places to check out and were flexible with an early check in for us. Highly recommend to other travelers!

25939178,336089971,2018-10-14,32675652,William,I can’t comment on anything about Benjamin’s space because I was never granted entry. What I did experience however was extreme rudeness being forced to sleep in my car in the middle of Toronto losing my money and zero understanding over an honest mistake of not taking note of the check in time and arriving late. According to Airbnb policy Benjamin did nothing wrong but to deny a fellow human the basic need of shelter after they have paid you to provide exactly seems unethical to the point of cruelty and left me feeling as if I’d been robbed. I’m sure Benjamin’s condo is fine but I would strongly advise anyone reading to spend your money elsewhere and stay with a host who has a bit more compassion for fellow humans.
36414456,500087718,2019-08-01,83856445,Simone,Me and my boyfriend stayed at Irene’s place for 8 nights and everything was perfect! The house was super clean modern and nice furnished. Irene and her husband Vlad were always super helpfull with local tips and practical information and they were overall just really nice and lovely hosts. A huge plus was also that the house is placed REALLY close to the streetcars (they will take you all around downtown for only 3 dollars!). Beside that the neighborhood was really cute with a lot of places to buy food and so on. Me and my boyfriend will definitely come back and give Irene the best recommendation!
22283448,267739429,2018-05-22,47292825,Sheila,We had a great vacation! Perfect location to walk to restaurants nearby waterfront Rogers centre grocery store etc! Lots of space floor to ceiling windows with incredible views no problems checking in or out parking space was a bonus tons of storage in suite laundry the list could go on and on! Winnie always responded right away to any question I had! A successful girls trip with my sister and daughter!

4951472,58976704,2016-01-05,9239618,Jennifer, Booking over Christmas and New Year's can be a challenging time but Dale and Karen made me feel welcome.  The space was perfect and their home is in one of the best parts of Toronto. I had almost given up on AIRBNB but Dale redeemed it with a fantastic experience. Dale is definitely a superhost. Booking here will not disappoint
6107554,34364120,2015-06-07,25821749,Adriana,The condo was much more spacious than anticipated!

Apartment furnishing is basic as noted in description so is suitable for a place to sleep rather than a place to hang around.

It is extremely clean and it is a pleasure! The view on the balcony is amazing and the location of the apartment is very great too. We parked the car and we walked all our weekend. 
Just I would say that the apartment is for 2 and not 3 I slept on the sofa and it is not comfortable at all.... 

Thank you Andrew it was amazing ;)"

The street is nice and quiet (we didn't hear any traffic noise at night) so it's perfect for sleeping. Darya greeted us upon our arrival and gave us a tour and answered our questions - she was also readily available by cell phone to answer any questions. Pictures are true to life - place is perfect size for 4 adult guests.

20524898,458997231,2019-05-26,239643597,Crystal,I cannot rave enough about marlo’s place! So beautiful lovely view of the city  and so stylish and comfortable. Marlo is a fantastic host. Her communication is exceptional and her generosity is too! She was quick to offer a bottle of wine to me and left a night cap on the counter when I arrived. Great touch was a little toiletrie cart in the bedroom in case you forgot something at home. So thoughtful!! Very quiet neighbors ensured very restful evenings which is something that can be hard to find in a typical hotel or other Airbnb’s. If you are considering staying at marlo’s do it!! It’s the best experience with Airbnb that I have ever had. Thanks a million marlo! I’ll be coming back to you when I need a place in the city again for sure! :)

Amazing views and great layout.  The space has a much bigger feel than the photos suggest.  Great light and flow.  Sheryl was the perfect host.  We felt like we had a friend in Toronto that was available to help with anything yet not overbearing.  We felt welcomed and at home.  Thank you for making our weekend such a success.
9969830,231127434,2018-01-30,160478999,Pia,"My sister and I stayed at this apartment in Toronto during the 26th-30th of Jan. The apartment was very nice however we encountered a few issues. We arrived in Toronto at 12am (nighttime) due to the late check in we had to pay an extra 50$. We do not understand why we had to pay this extra cost as there is self check in through a lock box. Also the homepage said that there would be a shared pool but this was not accessible at the time due to repairs. This should have been mentioned prior to our arrival. Another point I would like to add is that the floor was not particularly clean. 
Aside from this we really enjoyed our stay in Toronto."
32956682,567461927,2019-11-22,67133986,Isai,Si este alojamiento atrajo tu atención es porqué realmente mereces dormir en una cama comodisima mi esposa y yo repetimos una segunda estancia aqui por la excelente calidad y hospitalidad de Nelly y Steve  además de todos los beneficios que ya describimos en la primera estancia...simplemente genial... :)

The house was great - very accurate with the photos and descriptions there was always easy parking and the outdoor space was such a nice feature of the house! Aj and Dave were so lovely very easy to talk to very welcoming and they added so many thoughtful touches to the place. It felt safe and homey and Queen St really has everything you could want within walking distance. Thanks again - this was the perfect cottage in the city! :)

Not only is this Airbnb in a perfect location (extremely walkable to many awesome restaurants bars parks and stores) but it is also absolutely beautiful. The apartment’s modern renovation felt very comfortable and was sparkling clean. The space was a perfect relaxing place to come back to after a long day in the city!

390395,1669489,2012-07-09,2167333,Clara,Sean est un hôte extra qui aime recevoir les gens et ça se sent ! Dès notre arrivée après plusieurs heures de route bonheur: une bière rafraîchissante partagée sur un balcon fleuri magnifique au coeur de Toronto ! Et puis nous avons craqué pour ses 2 adorables chats très calins ! Enfin surprise au petit matin: nous avons eu droit à un délicieux petit déjeuner pris encore une fois sur le balcon en profitant du soleil et en discutant avec notre hôte. Bref c'était une courte halte mais elle nous a enchantés et nous comptons bien revenir voir Sean ! :) Merci encore pour cet accueil chaleureux et décontracté !
23576267,253996341,2018-04-15,26954793,Aimee,Samar was a great host! She was so helpful in accommodating us when we had some troubles with parking and she was always quick to respond to our questions. Her place was perfect for what we needed and very clean! It was an amazing location as well!
24743672,294835875,2018-07-22,1000583,Nicks,My stay at Vikram's place was great! He is a very warm and friendly person who made me feel at home.  People say that dogs reproduce their owner's personality so that might be the reason why Moka his dog is so sweet. I was in Toronto for a conference and my daily routine consisted in going every day to the city center. Even though his place is located in the Danforth the fact it is a couple blocks from a subway station made my daily journey very easy and fast. I strongly recommend staying with Vikram and Moka.
13139555,342366603,2018-10-28,147517739,Maria,My boyfriend and I had a great time staying here. Carlos & Mari have a beautiful space in such a cute neighborhood! This apartment had so many personal touches that made you feel like you were in your own beach house. Would definitely stay here again.
18173998,445519347,2019-04-29,145325245,Sepideh,Lovely relatively spacious clean and importantly for Toronto quiet. Fully equipped kitchen and bathrooms. There was even spare toothpaste which I had forgotten to bring with me. Check in was very simple. Parking lot was very useful. Would definitely stay here again.
6868389,276715551,2018-06-14,72861724,Zach,Linda has an awesome place! It is beautifully designed with lot's of room and great amenities. Will definitely be back!
1001438,237916522,2018-02-24,51115639,Nadia,My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed staying with Janet in her beautiful house. One of my favorite airbnb experiences so far ! The location is amazing as it's only a short 5 minute walk to Queen St to the south and Kensington market/Chinatown maybe a 10 minute walk North East. She had a lovely place to come back to very stylish and clean. As a host she is well travelled a great conversationalist and made us feel right at home :)
18393666,440271188,2019-04-20,42783707,Leandra,"I honestly don’t have much to say about this place other than I’m disappointed because it wasn’t what I expected. The unit itself was beautiful. The pictures were pretty accurate very spacious and beautiful artwork all over the apartment. As a blogger myself I would’ve loved to taken advantage of the space to take photos in it however I was dissatisfied majority of the time due to being woken up both mornings of my stay because of loud noises from the owners downstairs. Although we had very little interaction with them I could hear them walking around slamming doors talking etc. Also the part that made my stay the most unenjoyable was the constant cigarette smell. I smelled it in the unit itself as well as the hallway. It was to the point where we had to go out ourselves to get air freshener and lysol to get rid of the smell. Which sucks because in the description it stated “no smoking in the apartment” soo.. that’s just something to be aware of. As for parking there’s no driveway you have to park on the street which we ended up getting a ticket because of lack of instructions on where to park. 
Honestly the only good part about the stay was the area; there’s plenty of restaurants and things to do in the area itself. Very close to TTC stops. Also the unit itself was beautiful like I mentioned earlier. 
Everything else was a complete disappointment. I’d rather spend my money elsewhere."
27806092,498880320,2019-07-30,12865008,Lester And Morgan,Rebecca's place is very cozy and clean. She was very communicative and was there to greet us on arrival and to get the dogs acquainted. Traveling on a road trip cross country her place was a warm welcome for us! The back yard is a nice fenced in space for the dogs to stretch their legs. Brady their dog is very sweet. A short drive from Toronto it's a very convenient place to stay and explore the area. Would definitely recommend and stay again!
4226656,28452690,2015-03-23,5237452,Gattlin,The check in process was super easy and the building was beautiful! The apartment itself was very clean and modern. Its location couldn't be more conveniently located as it is only around 10 minutes walking from any major tourist attraction. I definitely want to come back in the summer months to enjoy the balcony and pool area!
29702333,505042099,2019-08-08,58144884,Long,Convenient location in Toronto; all necessities are available in the apartment and around the area; clean comfortable and enjoyable. Definitely recommend Salman's place to everyone.

20732368,514633722,2019-08-21,56681500,Messiva,Le logement était parfait il y avait tout ce dont on avait besoin. L’emplacement est correct le bus 506 connecté au 504 vous ramène en plein centre ville. L’hôte nous a très bien accueilli et nous a tout mît sur une feuille de route (indications attractions... ). Je reviendrai sans hésiter !
4808701,461985942,2019-06-01,255255720,Christina,A wonderful place to stay. Beautifully decorated close to everything. I will definitely stay there again and am looking forward to it. Thanks Robby!
15204457,481358117,2019-07-04,254401877,Courtney,Fantastic location! Having parking here at Anton and Natalia’s loft was super clutch. Very kind with local suggestions and especially not being from the area we appreciated the fast response time of we had questions or concerns. The check in was a little confusing but overall a good experience and I’d recommend it.
11878962,190558758,2017-09-04,225739,Jingwen,Quaint cottage style apartment conveniently situated downtown and walking distance to most places and public transport. The apartment was fully equipped with all the things you will need for your stay.  The owner was also very accommodating with the check in time. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Toronto at this lovely no-fuss accommodation. Totally recommend staying here.
24431562,446484817,2019-05-01,161154649,Jiachen,Linens and pillows didn't seem washed. Was getting bug bites as I slept on the bed somehow. Location is very good however.

Clean safe and friendly space."
25773926,498341823,2019-07-29,42299981,Anne & Dave,This home is located in close proximity to public transportation. We used bus 505 to travel to downtown as well as the UP station at Bloor. Accommodations and amenities were great for a large family group. 4 comfortable queen beds provided sleeping for the adults as well as sofa beds for the children. Parking for 2 cars  in the back was convenient and appreciated.

1510402,58152112,2016-01-01,48367254,Xinyi,We stayed at Amy's house for 2 days. The room was spacious warm and cozy. Amy gave us plenty of wonderful advice on eateries & shopping malls & places to watch the fireworks for New Year. Their house is very close to Dufferin Station which only takes about 15-20 minutes to downtown Toronto and 30 minutes to Pearson Airport. My friend and I had a really loving stay with Amy& Graeme. I will definitely come again next time we exploring Toronto.

9969830,278740797,2018-06-18,163925703,Els,Great place! The appartement was clean and had everything you could wish! Great connection with public transport and the private parking was the best!
20757986,407590844,2019-02-02,176601409,Julian,"worked fine for what we needed which was simply a bed to crash in 
upstairs neighbors were fairly loud throughout the night and morning"
7971951,141549212,2017-04-03,721877,Chris,"We really loved staying at this apartment in trendy Liberty Village. I think it would have been hard to find a better view in all of Toronto - and it was incredible to watch the sun rise behind the CN Tower in the morning. We were two couples and it was a perfect hub for us to get out for lunch return early evening and then out for the night. Downtown was only a short tram ride away and Queen Street West which had some excellent restaurants and bars was a short walk north. 

It was exactly as is pictured in the listing and everything was very clean. It was nice to have access to then pool and gym (even though we didn't end up using it!). Only a couple of negatives; one being that one of the TV's only plays from a laptop and the other being that you've only got one key which means if one of the guests leaves another guest has to go down to the ground floor to let them in. 

Make sure to check your messages from J.A.M. as the address that is listed is incorrect. And whilst this apartment is only 2 mins away it caused some confusion when we arrived. 

J.A.M. were incredibly responsive and answered our questions quickly as well as giving us great tips for making the most out of Toronto. We'd definitely stay here again! "
20965914,552868731,2019-10-22,49579307,Wayne,"Amazing place to stay close to queen street west . The host was absolutely fabulous and the Airbnb was out of this world. It was beautiful decorated and very comfortable. The host when out of her way to make sure that we had a few basic items in the refrigerator to start our day . That was very thoughtful of her . You have to met Joe the cat he is adorable. Overall a great place an amazing host . Merci encore une fois
Wayne and Christian"
28684811,424972435,2019-03-17,247607843,Jacquelyn,Nice clean studio with an excellent kitchen. Especially good for a family with young kids.
23860245,310420669,2018-08-19,46797235,Alex,Pegah’s place is outstanding! 6 of us stayed there comfortably. It’s beautiful clean close to so many options for food and fun. Pegah’s tips for places to go were very helpful. We had an amazing time. 
20094311,263318592,2018-05-11,185234756,Elizabeth,Lydia was amazing at communication. Very quick with responses to all questions. Her space was clean and welcoming. Perfect for  2  people. Maybe a few more. Easy for walking or driving.

38775190,542735106,2019-10-06,274093364,Rhoda,Awesome host..
6692118,83778740,2016-07-04,2589399,Ann,Sarah was flexible and accomodating. We did not meet but Sarah made it very easy for us to get into the apartment. She checked on us via email and answered our questions. The apartment has a back door with little patio area that can be accessed from the side street which made it perfect for storing our bikes and carrying in our gear.  The apartment is the perfect size for two adults. It is very clean and decorated with an artist's touch. The bed is comfortable and there is a drawer and hanging space clothes. The bathroom and shower sufficient. Sara left space in the refridgerator for our food and welcomed us to use the food she left behind. It is in a really great neighborhood within walking distance to lots of good restaurants (Tibetan and Nepali are our favorites) coffee shops groceries and other conveniences. It is just two blocks from the park and bike path that runs along the lake. We biked into Toronto twice - just an easy 15 minute ride for a 60 year old woman. High Park with its zoo and pond is within riding or walking distance too. Public transportation is plentiful. We really enjoyed our stay in this cozy well located apartment and would definately stay with Sarah again if we get the opportunity.
6620431,107162406,2016-10-09,49125034,Tuukka,Aamer was a great host. The apartment was in good condition and also had a central location. Easy access to everything in Toronto

13805486,339438454,2018-10-21,1942701,Allison,Great location in downtown area with nice accommodations. James was very helpful and provided local spots to visit and eat. Hosts were easy to communicate with for check in arrangements.
29999182,553182351,2019-10-23,115712627,Andrew,Repeat visitor can’t beat the location. Great communication with host.
25288689,468071564,2019-06-11,152991047,Olivier,"I'm calling this a 10/10 subjective to your needs obviously. Thanks Amina.

Not meant for tall people (low ceiling) thankfully I'm 5""8 and it was perfect. It's a really convenient location with the bus stop at 2 seconds from your door and it brings you to Ossington Station in 5 min. Amina gave me 2 coins to help me settle in and get familiar with the TTC. There is also a coffee shop next door which is always nice. The place was super clean and cozy. Because it's a small loft-appartment it has a private kitchen bathroom and living room which made it worth every penny. It's a basement so it gets a bit stuffy but Amina has all the equipment in place (dehumidifier and such) to make this irrelevant. On the contrary it was nice and cool during warm days. Just make sure to turn off the dehumidifier before bed cause it might wake you up at night. 

That's it I liked it!"
15081835,173631244,2017-07-23,55105210,G,nice place! 10 out of 10  :)

20771358,211815579,2017-11-14,154869668,Sinan,"Nice place close to the 401 so it's easy to drive around. The nearest subway station is a little far but there's a bus stop just down the street. 

The place itself is great. Not too noisy it's on a major street so there's obviously going to be traffic but it's not unbearable. The kitchen was filled with essential supplies. Milk bread water cereal etc.

I have no complaints and the price is very modest."
33887055,567059161,2019-11-21,36772864,E. Jean,Loved this rental! If I could give 1000 stars for location I would. This is the best location in Toronto and the pool is stunning. Great spot for families as the pool has a shallow area and it's connected to the PATH for those cold winters. I found the host helpful and responsive. Will stay again!
19458394,179476330,2017-08-07,84695265,Zach,This place was perfect for us in a nice quiet safe neighborhood. Jennifer made the stay perfect by being on top of all details and answering questions very quickly. I would not hesitate to rent with her again. thank you Jennifer.

17224913,203259133,2017-10-14,20209378,Pramod,"A hidden gem of a place!! This apartment is a unit on the ground floor of a 1950’s home with tons of character. The suite is completely independent with beautiful scenery and excellently sunlight. The house is located in the quiet and hilly neighborhood south of Bloor 5 min walk from Jane’s subway station. Parking is available. 

Audrius and Mary are excellent hosts who accommodated us though we arrived past 10pm. They provided a number of clean white towels and that was much appreciated. There is fresh coffee and microwave plenty of water and ample supplies. Bed is comfortable. Hot water is plenty. 

All in all this is an outstanding place to stay. Don’t miss this gem if you like old world charm."

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Toronto; we had a great time enjoying all the local amenities and tourist attractions. We didn’t need to drive anywhere everything was in walking distance.
27524266,520496956,2019-08-30,289184813,Hussain,Very clean room. Sharing one bathroom between three different rooms was a bit tough though. Great location if you don’t have a car as parking is 5 minutes away and you have to pay for it
28808797,529251051,2019-09-14,270966051,Chetan,A bit expensive for what it is but overall its an ok place to stay not somewhere youd like to spend more than a couple of nights very basic.
3332196,46429446,2015-09-10,27866137,단비,"Very clean and nice place to stay! Also Tam is friendly and very willing to communicate. 

It's right next to a big market and also there are some small cafes around. If you need a place to stay for couple days I would recommend her place! "

33851393,510079735,2019-08-15,283774669,Dara,My girlfriend and I stayed here after our trip to Toronto for my birthday. The location was close enough to downtown so that we were able to Uber when we got sick of driving and a mall nearby came in handy when she needed to buy a new pair of heels before dinner. The place itself was spotless and very cozy and comfy. It had everything we needed and more with nice little touches such as snacks and tea bags as well as a kettle! Thank you to our lovely hosts for everything and we hope to be back :)

655522,8060212,2013-10-14,2398349,Julia,Basil's home is comfy and colourful and perfect for anyone looking for a creative vintage-inspired space. It's on a quiet street near Baldwin Village Chinatown and Kensington Market and is only a short walk to the Queen West shopping district. It was perfect for my 2 week stay in Toronto. Basil was very kind and accommodating. I would definitely recommend his beautiful space.
17541440,540991537,2019-10-04,297786303,Diesha,Great location and a super responsive host. Check in was smooth. The unit could have smelt better but overall an okay experience

He was fine with us arriving earlier than mid day and was very helpful in telling us about different places to eat/drink in the area. The room was quite spacious with lots of natural light. The area is great for bars and restaurants (Korea town is just down the street delicious food!) Overall a great stay! Cheers Alan!

1552251,57111526,2015-12-22,34496375,Lars,I stayed for four months at Mable’s place. It was an unforgettable experience; everything I could have wished for and more! First of all the basement apartment provided me with all the facilities I needed: a spacious bedroom with a huge bed and a very nice (nice nice) clean bathroom with shower and bath. In addition the other facilities throughout the house (including the Wifi washing machine dryer and kitchen appliances – not that I cooked that much except for baking some cookies and cake) were in a perfect state as well. Yet even if these facilities would have been in worse condition I would still  have had an amazing stay during those four months as I spent most of my time outside my room. Mable James Melissa and Stephanie are very welcoming helpful open and warm-hearted people who made sure that my stay was not ‘just’ a great stay. Specifically thanks to them I felt at home during those four months. In my opinion that is the biggest compliment one could get (and I could give)! All in all I would definitely recommend this place. From the bottom of my heart thank you Mable James Melissa and Stephanie for the very memorable time I spent at your place!

The apartment was quiet comfortable and very clean. Check in and check out was very smooth as it's very easy to talk to Kien-Thao. 

The neighborhood is also perfect. Close to Christie Pits Park and Koreatown we were never too far away from things to do or places to go. Highly recommend a stay here!"

Sincerely thank you Paul."

They are wonderful hosts and have been very quick in replying our questions. The House is beautiful really perfect for a family with kids and our two sons very much enjoyed the backyard. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood and you can reach everything you need for your daily needs. There are lots of bus stops street car stations and 2 TTC stations within walking distance. Everything was prepared for our arrival and Cayleigh and her husband showed us the house have us helpful explanations about the use of the appliances about shopping and dining facilities and they had also prepared a booklet with information about the neighboorhood where to eat where to go etc. We felt home from the very first day and this thanks to our hosts. All is very clean the kitchen very well-equipped and this made travelling with our kids very easy and convenient. We absolutely recommend this house and certainly Cayleigh as a host who even prepared a welcome gift for our family. Thanks again so much to Cayleigh and Patrick for their hospitality!

When we arrived the room was just as nice as it appears in the pictures and the bed was supremely comfortable! Harry offered recommendations around town and was friendly in every way. He even made it a point to come down and say goodbye to us when we had an early morning send-off. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Toronto! 
18971463,198490381,2017-09-29,20788044,Lai Hock,Good location and great view of the Canoe Landing Site. Quiet despite proximity to the busy city center. And there are 3 separate bathrooms one for each of the bedrooms.
18717210,446505576,2019-05-01,200836234,Hema,I stayed at Peter’s place for a conference. It’s a cute space in a nice building. I had no problems. Peter was prompt with responses. The building is located in a fun area in town.

Check-in was easy and accommodated our arrival time. The home was very clean - spotless! It was fully stocked and nice and quiet without any interruptions to keep us up or wake us early. The neighbourhood was lovely quiet and walking distance to many great restaurants and means of transportation.  
25728134,542669197,2019-10-06,295204438,Aimee,"Nice place in walking distance to cool semi-upscale (not commercialized which is great seemed local which is great) good toe into urban for non urban tourists!! Made me miss living in the city. Off street parking! 30 min walk from the Toronto (Website hidden by Airbnb) you can walk off dinner feeling safe. 

The place was nice also. Comfortable bed and sheets! If we had stayed when warmer we would have surely used the cute back patio!!!"
18795361,234027066,2018-02-11,86319718,Adam,Andre was a great host! He was very friendly and hospitable. We had a late check in on a Friday night and he was still very patient and accommodating with my girlfriend and I. The location itself is very close to downtown and has a perfect view of the city. We would absolutely stay with Andre again.
11533218,130680757,2017-02-07,110654579,Illakiya,Alpers home is located in the heart of downtown Toronto. He outlines the process for check-in and check-out on the itinerary which is clear and concise. Alper was easily accessible and would respond to messages with urgency. His home is what you see in the pictures- he was a great host and I would defiantly recommend booking with him. 
19593508,192947006,2017-09-11,145072009,Deidra,This apartment is in a charming quiet neighbourhood. It is spacious and clean with nice furnishings. Andrea was quick to answer any questions I had and was perfect to communicate with. Within walking distance from a lot of popular places and only 15 minutes from downtown in moderate traffic.
26394453,485891324,2019-07-11,264092469,Stephanie,It‘s a very nice and clean Airbnb on a really play near the centre. Jo is very friendly and helpful for every question.
38755110,557316677,2019-10-31,162361,Tanisha,"We rented this place as it was listed as an ""entire apartment."" The listing is misleading; it is not the entire apartment but rather the top 2 floors of a 3-floor apartment (i.e. shared apartment). There is no separate entrance nor any option to close off the top 2 floors. The main floor of the apartment (which is not part of this listing) occasionally has guests as well. From the main (and only) entrance  the 2nd floor landing is clearly visible i.e. no real privacy. For example if you walk out of the bathroom anyone standing by the door on the main floor will have a clear view of you. Although Heri reassured us that the main floor guests would never be allowed upstairs there is no actual barrier to stop someone from doing so -- they literally just have to climb up the stairs to be in our space. We cancelled on our first day after viewing the place; not only were we concerned about our own privacy and safety we also did not think it was appropriate for our pet cat whom we had brought with Heri's consent and for whom we had paid a hefty overcharge. There are locks on the individual bedrooms but we feel that in renting an ""entire apartment"" we really should not have to lock our own rooms before going out. 

This apartment ought to be listed as shared accommodation. The misleading description caused me an enormous amount of stress as I then had to scramble last minute to find a safe accommodation for ourselves and our animal. Unless you are looking for a hostel-style accommodation I cannot recommend this place."
14471456,108121405,2016-10-14,22677067,Jamie,"This was our first visit to Toronto and the apartment is a real gem! It was super easy to find on a nice street in a cool part of town. LP has done a great job with the space - it feels modern homely and clean. There were some lovely local beers waiting for us on arrival as well as fresh milk and coffee. 

We highly recommend a visit to High Park (20 minute walk) and dinner at Burdock Emerson and Three Speed (we did them all!). Starving Artist is a super spot for breakfast. 

We hired a car to drive to Niagara and used a very cheap car park next to Lansdowne subway instead of getting a permit - it cost $3 from 6pm - 7am. 

We really recommend staying here. It's a great spot within stumbling distance of some fantastic restaurants.

14407173,172684946,2017-07-21,136993362,Geraldine,Very quaint and comfortable condo the location was fabulous and so close to the TTC. It was my first experience and I was nervous so thanks to Alex who made my trip to Toronto a memorable one.
31151644,458809900,2019-05-26,231515792,Indrasen,Very bad experience. As a woman staying there  I was very uncomfortable taking shower because of men hair in the bathroom. His friends was home when we arrived and they were loud also the house was smelling food late night.   We had to go and warn them that they should keep quiet as we were trying to sleep.. I did not like my stay at this location and I not recommend it. ( Reviewing this as a wife )
25266223,336576347,2018-10-14,167751087,Helmar,We had a great stay in that nice und bright house with a lot of space. We really would like to stay there again.

The apartment is on a quiet street and just minutes to the Yonge subway line - perfect for getting downtown. Parking onsite is such a luxury in the city and that was very convenient. We were only there for one night but could have easily settled in for a week! This unique home is an absolute must if you’re visiting Toronto. A truly beautiful Airbnb experience. Thank you!
7774544,457637447,2019-05-24,162265664,Katy,Listing says unit #445 but upon check in I was told the unit was #604. Not sure why the listing is incorrect but that should be fixed. Place could use a good cleaning. Seemed as though it was not cleaned between uses which was pretty annoying to deal with. Some amenities were missing or didn’t work. Wouldn't rebook here again. Good thing here was the private and free parking on site.
22048823,228597838,2018-01-20,81978165,Josh,Great space for a great price close to downtown clean comfy and stylish I'd definitely recommend.

There's a really cool pedestrian bridge behind the building that crosses over the rail lines for an easy walk into the entertainment district. Pedram was very responsive to my questions and everything was exactly as I expected.

Liberty Village is safe and you can find everything you need. We enjoyed coffee at the condo and took a quick walk to Metro for groceries. We also loved Balzac's coffee just down the street. 
Sean answered so many questions I had within minutes. 
A lake view and CN Tower view. You really can't ask for more. I want to go back."

Though we only stayed one night it was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. The apartment comes with a private balcony fully equipped kitchen lounge room and so many interesting and artsy pieces throughout. Would love to stay again!

The bedroom and the bathroom were lovely and my overall stay was very comfortable. I had all the privacy I wanted and Ellen was quick to respond to any inquiries that I had. I would absolutely recommend.
33497563,526851594,2019-09-09,175223302,Szofi,Michael's house is conveniently located near the streetcar stop and is sparkling clean. The loft is a really cool space the only thing is that it's connected to the staircase so it's not a 100% private but that's okay as everyone in the house is nice and respectful. Tubes the cat is super adorable and made an already perfect stay even better. The only disadvantage might be the distance from downtown but as mentioned the streetcar stop is just around the corner and public transport is easy to use.

24113998,365688903,2019-01-01,74780289,Nathan,"The Host is very nice and quick to replay to any issues as we had a few. Let’s start with the unit it is in a house converted to 6 studio apartments. We stayed in Unit 3 which is on the bottom floor near the front door and It was very Noisy. There are 2 front doors to get through to get to the unit’s door. The washer/dryer is also located outside this units door and isn’t quiet. The windows in the units have blinds that help block some light but don’t help with road noise. (Need some curtains for the bedroom to be dark) 
Also the bathroom is a stand-up shower big enough for a child. I’m 6 foot tall and had to literally squat to wash my hair as the shower head is about 5 foot high but that wasn’t worst. The shower is tiny I hit my elbows every time I used the shower because it’s so tight. Overall it’s not a bad place to stay but at $100 a night with cleaning fee etc I would pick somewhere else."

27276604,345928357,2018-11-06,199548741,Parvathy K,Communication was excellent and Jackie was prompt with replies. She was kind enough to come pick me up when I got to the apartment late. The negatives were that there was some dust beneath the bed and the room was a bit smaller than I expected. If you have a lot of luggage it might be a bit of a squeeze. Had some difficulty finding the apartment but the location can't be beat. Great access to Toronto.

It was in the perfect location for us to talk to the Distillery District the lake and St. Lawrence Market. Parking was easy and our room was super comfortable. The only downer was having to share one bathroom with other guests but it was a small inconvenience to stay at Harry's great place!

I was alone and although there are a lot of homeless they don’t bother you. The city is very clean.  You are very close to DT Eatons centre Dundas street. I walked. About 10 mins.

553972,29438446,2015-04-07,6854482,Nagat,I loved my stay at Caroline's. She was a great host very friendly warm honest and helpful. My room was clean cosy full of art which is great for an artist. The bed was comfortable probably more so than some of the highly rated hotels I've been to before. The location was great family friendly safe  and close to public transportation and downtown. I highly recommend her place and I would definitely always consider her for my visits to toronto.

Milana was a perfect host - friendly and helpful - and her cats were a great bonus! I would recommend this room and would happily stay here again.
4929467,85649804,2016-07-12,24817173,Brittany,Coolest possible place to stay in Toronto. My boyfriend and I really wanted to find a unique spot in TO and this fit the bill. Tanya and Enzo were chill and we found the whole experience very laid back and relaxing. Loved our room!

18615582,202983606,2017-10-13,24815244,Nicolas,Tristan is really a nice host ! He spoke with me all time : before during and after the trip. The flat is very nice clean and have good equipments. 20 min walk to the CN tower and there is a bus station at 2 min if needed. Very quiet and the night view is awesome. I recommand it !
4030789,209585440,2017-11-05,10374451,Giorgio,The apartment is nice cozy and well organized with comfortable bed and sofa bed. The space is stylish and furnished with an eye for details in decor. The communication with Ilya was prompt and satisfactory and he always made sure all was well (the guests from another unit in the house were having a loud late night party on one of the nights and Ilya made sure to shut down the party immediately after I messaged him about it). The only minus of this place is its location: even though it's walkable and close to public transit the neighborhood is pretty bad (it definitely isn't the host's fault though). Overall it was a good stay and Ilya is a great host!
12088303,127002496,2017-01-15,45230419,Paul,Lynn is accommodating and friendly! She really cares about your experience and the place is very central and cosy.

30004816,352661843,2018-11-25,33364182,Zou,A cosy room with a confortible bed in a nice house. Very clean. I liked my stay. Sally is nice. The only negative point is that I asked her before I booked how far her place is from my work(I gave the exact adress  my work is close to the CN Tower) and she answered a half of an hour. once booked I discover that the traject takes more than 1 hour. I asked her to cancel the reservation and she refused :(

26842154,324225741,2018-09-16,73105007,Bruce,This is an excellent location for visiting TIFF or any other Toronto tour. Close to the St. Lawrence market Bay Street business district Goodlife fitness Union Station Eaton Centre tram system subway access. For TIFF a leisurely 15 minute stroll to the main theatres at King & John 10 minutes to the Winter Garden/Elgin theater and another 5 minutes to the Ryerson. No subway tokens required! The neighborhood includes a 24 hour grocery store across the street a burrito place at the end of the block and the best burger joint ever at the other end of the block (the elk burger is phenomenal). There are a wide variety of restaurants cafes crepe places and night spots within walking distance.  The condo is new and very clean with a high tech (Hidden by Airbnb) home system and large tv screen with chromecast. Awake to ask Ok (Hidden by Airbnb)  what is the weather like to get a verbal response. Thankfully the hurricanes  in the States every TIFF festival keep the weather sunny and warm except for the odd umbrella required day. 24hour parking on level 2 for about 14$ per day (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Security at entrance. I'd be (Website hidden by Airbnb) a New York minute.

6541318,64706779,2016-03-06,45662190,Allison,Rebecca's place is exactly as described and better. The condo itself is very comfortable and there is lots of space. Rebecca was a very nice host and made my first AirBNB experience a great one. She was flexible with check in and check out times she was quick to responded to all messages and she left clear instructions and tips on her place as well as the area it is in. I highly recommend staying at her condo if you are ever in the great city of Toronto!

15806233,260069708,2018-05-03,177478212,Utsavi,This is clearly one of the best option to stay when you are planning a trip to Toronto. We checked hundreds of hotels and apartment before booking this one and glad that we chose To stay at this apartment. It gives you an absolute homelike feeling. Area wise the apartment is bigger than most of the hotel rooms and other condos in downtown. All the amenities are in perfect condition and gives you a hasslefree stay. The area is very safe and all necessities Like Bank Grocery Restaurants Street Cars are just within a 5 minute walk.

The location could not get any better!! The neighbours are friendly and complex is filled with trees so it really doesn't even feel like you are in the heart of downtown Toronto. 
Thanks Tara!! "

1066718,56511545,2015-12-14,38871074,Natalia,"Our stay at Emil's in Central West Toronto was superb. We really felt welcomed by Emil and very comfortable his home is the perfect layout for a BnB with separate living quarters own ensuite and adjoining private courtyard. The house has character and style and a freshclean and airy feel. As far as location goes couldn't have been better Queen street just 100 meters down the road truly amazing such a diverse area with cafes restaurants boutique shopping bars and the list goes on. We went down for a coffee and came home 12 hours later. When we came home and couldn't wait to tell Emil about our experience. We understand now why Queen Street was voted by vogue  Magazine as the 2nd best street in the world-Wow!
Thanks so much Emil you are a charming and hospitable host who went out of his way to make our stay a wonderful experience.
Emil you make the best coffees.

6406028,507381977,2019-08-11,199058366,Helen,Lovely place just right outside of down town. Close enough that nothing is too far. Far enough that you don't get that downtown noise.
4058460,261547058,2018-05-06,170944419,Jasmine,Alex was a great host and the place was exactly what it was advertised to be. My friend and I were new to the city and Alex was very helpful in helping us get around the city in terms of informing us about different modes of transportation. He was also understanding when we asked to check in our luggage early which helped us get the most out of our trip!

1066718,51286021,2015-10-19,6442335,Tim,"Not only is Emil's the PERFECT place to stay in Toronto but Emil himself is the BEST! First of all you have your own beautiful apartment all to yourself on the first floor with everything you could possibly need. Then within a 10-minute walk is every type of restaurant and shop imaginable on beautiful Queen Street West. But Emil's place is very quiet so you have the best of both worlds!!

There's NO way I'd stay anywhere else in Toronto! Thanks so much Emil!! :)"

38754258,541021258,2019-10-04,48903524,Xiaowen,Sandy's place is quiet clean spacious. It is steps away from the CN Tower and many other attractions we enjoined. Lots of great restaurants and bars in the area. Jasper was very nice easy to talk to and answered all our questions. I would definitely come again!
27080380,526091984,2019-09-08,79132641,Katherine,Roland and Lynn are very kind and friendly and willing to provide insight and history on the area -- they've lived there for more than 40 years! While you do have the entire basement to yourself -- which is great -- it's worth noting that there is no physical door to close at the  top of the stairs leading into the basement and this open doorway at the top of the stairs leads directly into the shared kitchen space.  I slept fine but if you are a light sleeper I could see this being an issue.

Leo was most helpful in explaining directions and how to navigate the subway (I'd never been to the area before).

Leo also took care of the parking permit required by the city.

If my health care system related advocacy work ever takes me back that way hope to stay there again."
23939125,544665375,2019-10-10,281592623,Zuberia,This was my first experience in an Airbnb and it was a really good one. Alice and her husband Roger are great hosts such warm and friendly people. We had so much luggage with us as we were in between moving apartments and they were so kind to accommodate our stuff. Their place is very comfortable and they've kept it super clean. The location is pretty good too just a 3-4 mins walk to the nearest bus stop or 5 mins drive to the subway station. Would definitely recommend this place to others :)

17154713,262662752,2018-05-09,83010623,Robert,We had a great stay at Marnie and Tom's. The location is quiet and you have your own private entrance to the apartment. It's a simple 10 minute train journey into central Toronto. They added their own special touches by leaving a basket of fruit out for us in the morning and Netflix is always a positive when the weather isn't great. Well worth the stay and i'd happily come here again. Rob & Sam

The place is equipped for prepping breakfast (coffee included) and that’s also what we really needed.
28316485,402782767,2019-01-19,140359592,Damon,Great location with easy instructions for access and quick responses from Spencer. Would definitely recommend staying here to anybody looking for a cozy apartment and the optional onsite parking is a huge bonus if you’re driving in to the city!

Soni was very quick and helpful when we had questions or requests. 
The only thing that was a bit bothering was the heating room next to us which sometimes got a bit loud but only for a few mins. 
All in all a very good price-performance ratio."

Ben was very helpful and clear about check-in and other expectations."
5785794,38306641,2015-07-14,4370675,Emanuele,Our stay with Angela and Chris was extraordinary! We were lucky enough to spend a week at their amazing house and feel at home! They are a kind generous and considerate couple who share the love of travelling and meeting new people. They have lived in the Toronto for many years and can tell you great places to eat and how to get around. The house is next to many eating options great coffee houses and shops. The bedroom is spotless with lots of storage space and a very comfortable bed. The kitchen is well equipped and the bathroom is spacious with a great shower. Highly recommended!

19718705,194318890,2017-09-16,18895136,Becky,Location is spot on (walkable to a lot of hot spots) and bed was super comfy! Thanks Brent!
21373802,524267654,2019-09-05,9176661,Kevin,Helen is great with communication prompt replies. The space is a basement apartment located in York Ontario. Helen lives in the house above. The space is quite cozy private and secure as there is a private entrance. Comfortable for 2-3 people to be able to stay. Only complaint would be you can sometimes hear noises from upstairs but I guess that's expected living in the basement. Thanks for being an accommodating host Helen!
15222379,298556436,2018-07-29,121421751,Dawn,Great space in a great location - we were within 25 min walking distance of everywhere we wanted to be. Public transportation also steps out the door. Hosts were very flexible and communicative - a wonderful first Airbnb experience. We hope to visit again soon!

2078597,75199286,2016-05-19,4996438,Christiane,"We didn`t meet Kate in person however felt welcome from the very beginning to the end of our stay.  Kate and Mike checked by e-mail if we had arrived safely and greeted us with a lovely flower bouquet a welcome card and a bowl of goodies.  In general they were totally dependable friendly in tone helpful and prompt at replying.  
The loft was delightful and we couldn`t dream of a better neighbourhood: quiet green with tons of little cafes and stores close to public transportation.  Can`t wait to come back!"
33880246,567835346,2019-11-23,166600996,Lorna,"AMAZING PLACE to stay very clean and very cozy near everything. Communication is fast easy check in.

26348407,508256852,2019-08-12,60290405,Ulises,"An amazing spot in Toronto close to not only already some interesting spots but also the subway making it extremely easy to move around town from here.

If you are a light sleeper you might struggle since you are right next to the entrance and with people above you as well so ear plugs recommended.

But overall a great place to stay."
14585271,262623955,2018-05-09,185823290,Syméon,"Great place to stay at Toronto. We received many tips about attractions to do and see in the city.
The hosts are very kind and welcoming and they are always ready to help if you have questions !"

4733208,312491971,2018-08-23,107210257,Sen,房东非常热情耐心负责｡一开始房东主动和我联系说是预定的住宿地方厕所可能会有点小问题问我想不想换到另一处｡我个人觉得吧厕所可能第二天我入住的时候已经修好但是房东还是主动给我提供免费升级大概不想耽误房客的行程或者降低房客的住宿体验｡直至成功入住房主一直会保持联系各种给我提醒｡当然了房子设计很简约;物品一应俱全;所以这次住宿体验真的很棒棒的!#responsible#nice#

33583213,511561607,2019-08-17,189382987,Rebekah,Andrew and Rina's place lived up to the pictures! It was clean well decorated and had an amazing balcony with a great view of the neighborhood. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and chocolates when we arrived. There were extra sheets and blankets for 2 people who don't like to share. :] The bathroom had some extra body wash and shampoo in case you forget yours. There is a Metro grocery store a block away so we walked there to pick up some snacks for our weekend stay. It was a little further of a walk to get to Queen Street than we expected but it was easy to get an Uber. When we had trouble finding the room and when we ran out of something Andrew was quick to respond and quick to provide us with what we needed. They also sent us a list of restaurant recommendations. Mildred's Temple Kitchen was a short walk and Her Father's Cider Bar had an amazing menu and was worth the 15 minute drive. If you go to the area on the weekend definitely check out St. Lawrence market. There are so many incredible European food booths; it was our favorite part of the trip! Overall definitely recommend staying here!
32847721,434178515,2019-04-07,55080091,Joe,Really lovely space beautiful neighborhood good view. Very smooth check in and check out--like hotel service. All in all probably the best experience I've had with AirBnb.

1699994,462932896,2019-06-02,1389177,Michael,John's place is fantastic.  So spacious clean and accurately presented on line.  As well as being a gorgeous place it's the little things that also count enough keys for all guests plenty of towels toilet roll beautiful clean linen and comfortable beds.  It's a great location near open spaces great for Queen West and Garment District plenty of restaurants cafes and convenience stores on your doorstep.   I can't recommend this highly enough!  Fabulous
18893052,324223114,2018-09-16,76752129,Jasmine,A lot more spacious than I thought! Everything is pretty much a 10 minute drive or a 5 minute walk away. Gas stations LCBO there’s a whole strip of stores a 2 minute walk away. Loren was a great host and would get to us immediately when we did need him.
13825593,524287379,2019-09-05,227551772,Gwendoly,Great place and host! Thank you!
14227945,147938495,2017-04-29,92159522,David,Lovely apartment in good central location for all the sports fields and close to the main roads.  60 floors up is a great view but the lifts get a bit boring after a week! 
20439435,269597535,2018-05-27,167870962,Nancy,I don’t have many experiences with Airbnb hosts but Josh and Suzanne definitely have set a standard! Their location is crazy good right beside a beautiful park in K-Town. We had everything we needed (cleaned linens and fresh towels) and then some (thank you for the extra rolls of toilet paper)!! Suzanne would answer all of our questions in less than an hour via text even though it was late at night! We had a bit of trouble of with the patio lights and just when I was texting Suzanne Josh came into save the night. They are  very responsive and accommodating throughout our week stay in Toronto. If you have a chance absolutely book with them!!

7486942,175306744,2017-07-28,135937861,Chris,Close to public transportation walkable to nearby attractions. If you're looking for a convenient low frills place to sleep this is it. Cat is awesome as well will welcome you back after a day of exploring.
27131740,449414243,2019-05-06,41850593,Seb,"Toronto is an overwhelming city. Kayleigh was great to get me settled in and met with me during the day. She was easy to reach and made the hassle of travel easy as I had a lot of other commitments to attend to. 

Would I stay again? The answer to that is yes! Just overall easy and convenient and I wouldn’t change it!"

27806092,478259600,2019-06-29,155191709,Derek,This was my first trip to Toronto and I could not be happier that I chose Rebecca's Airbnb. The space was great (had no clue it backed up to the river and how close it was to everything) Brady (the dog) brings a smile to your face and I cannot say enough about how great the hospitality and friendliness of Rebecca and Kieran was. I highly recommend this Airbnb!

Easy 10 mins walk from Union Station.   Starbucks in the same building and lots of restaurants within minutes of working.   Perfect location for anyone who wants to be in the downtown area.   Apartment was clean and spacious with a great view of the city especially during sunset.  

Would definitely stay here again."

Her place included everything I needed to stay in Toronto for a couple of days. So many stores to choose from nearby whether it is for shopping of food. Loved the comfortable bed. Definitely best value for your money. Would definitely book again in a heartbeat.

I loved the area and it had a super easy commute to downtown Toronto with the subway right around the corner. All in all it was a perfect stay.
7341262,330994188,2018-10-01,204590406,Kris,Nik is a wonderful host - welcomed me and my friend graciously. Made sure everything was ok upon arrival and helped describe best ways to get downtown. A nice walk from the train station in a beautiful neighborhood - this basement studio was perfect for our visit. Fresh linens and sheets provided and a small kitchenette available for basic needs. Overall a great experience - highly recommended!
1843242,39323161,2015-07-22,37190960,Hannah,This apartment was exactly what I expected from the listing.  It was very cozy and my sister and I had a wonderful stay. Cynthia was extremely friendly and she had the place looking great for our arrival.  She had helpful literature on all of the popular sights to see showed us where we could park during our stay and answered all of our questions.  So happy that we were able to see some of the Pan Am Games during our stay too! If we are ever in the Toronto area again I will definitely be looking to see if Cynthia's place is available.
4518633,338115047,2018-10-18,214483439,Rhonda,A great place and a great location!
28101958,495755387,2019-07-26,259790789,Kim,Although the location was great the host was late meeting us.  We stood outside an alternate location (at host's request) for 30 minutes with our luggage.  The condo's walls were dirty and scuffed throughout.  There seemed to be an infestation of fruit flies.  There was also spoiled food in the fridge.  We were not allowed to speak with anyone in the building and we were asked to lie if anyone approached us.  We will not stay here again.

1486931,29577580,2015-04-09,8282864,April,Dave's loft was amazing and so comfy. Great location close to cafe's restaurants and transit. A very hip and trendy neighborhood very safe too. Dave was a huge help by leaving instructions for the loft and getting settled. Also insight about the neighborhood and directions. The loft is very welcoming and bright.  I would definitely stay here again. Thanks again Dave you were a wonderful host. 
1560977,413981199,2019-02-18,28351634,Sonja,Beautiful bright apartment that felt warm and welcoming. There’s a great view of the lake and the location is fantastic—a short easy streetcar ride away from union station. The apartment was clean neat and had everything we wanted. Highly recommended.

Not too far from DT and in walking distance I could find StarbuckssubwayTim Horton and supermarket.
Especially I recommend u guys who plan to stay somewhere shortly and near to DT"

38999892,545060076,2019-10-11,67118774,Jeff,Sams place was good You get what you pay for and especially when you book a room  someone else’s place. You have to be ready to expect their friends over etc.. no shampoo or towels or anything of that nature but the bed was comfy and the condo was a good setup. Not bad for like $100 a night.

13814263,250933198,2018-04-06,177069855,Lindsey,Myself and 2 others were staying the night in Toronto for a conference and thought this 3 bedroom suite would be a great alternative to booking 3 hotel rooms.  It was fantastic!  Instructions were detailed and accurate the place was very clean and welcoming the view was wonderful and I wish I could give 10 stars for location.  One tip that may be helpful: if you arrive at the building when there is a large crowd around the elevators as we did it is much faster to take the non-high rise elevator and then just take the stairs the extra two floors.  I highly recommend this suite thank you again Kat!
7131751,63954327,2016-02-28,12395427,Jun-Lei,Vincent's place was in a good location within walking distance to Chinatown and easy to get to various sites  downtown. The place itself was nice and cosy had amenities and kitchen space to cook. Vincent was easy to communicate with and very prompt with replies. Vincent's mother was very kind showing me around the place and helping with my luggage. Thanks again for everything!

3332077,70235577,2016-04-17,58926933,Jeffrey,Jelena made us feel very welcome! The accommodations were lovely and perfect for our needs. We enjoyed the private entrance and the Apple TV. The location was excellent. Close to the subway with grocery convenience stores and parks nearby. The neighbourhood while close to the Danforth was quiet. There are several good restaurants and bakeries nearby. We particularly enjoyed the Viking bakery.

The perfect house at the perfect location with the perfect hosts."
9139993,193198791,2017-09-12,27526398,Lucie,Jonathan's place is lovely very well located (a few mins walk from the Entertainment district where I had to go most of the time for the festival) and also quite close to Kensington Market which is a lovely area. The place is very clean calm and even though we only met briefly Jonathan has been very communicative and precise in the information he shared. I'd definitely recommend this place!

29522689,347013967,2018-11-10,183929492,Nicholas,Kalvin's place was fantastic! A definete recommendation!
16243949,360149205,2018-12-19,38237613,Alvaro,"It was an experience with different feelings related to Paul's place.
The location was great in a really interesting neighborhood and close to Downtown.
On the other hand the apartment was really cold and the way to heat it was kind of ridiculous. A bit noisy as well because the apartment is literally above a bar.
Also check-in and check-out need to be done by Keycafe (basically picking up the keys for the apartment in another place). Well this method was giving some troubles and we lost time once we arrived and later when we needed to leave. I suggest a change in the way this procedure is done. 
The price was good but I would probably think about paying a bit more for another apartment and that way being able to feel confortable at home."
14633216,251735101,2018-04-08,117371228,Kamill,Greatest host not just a host but a friend now. Great value for this place would recommend.
5755168,122438734,2016-12-23,49384163,Marc,Tom and his family are remarkable people.  I was welcomed and shown the highest degree of respect throughout my stay as well as being provided all elements required to feel like I was in my own home!  Thank you!
10646501,152206082,2017-05-15,52669723,Leah,Me and my partner had a great stay at Andrew's place. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet whilst we were there but he was very friendly in the messages we exchanged and was kind enough to let us keep our bags at his apartment on the day of check out as we had a late flight. There is a streetcar right outside with great links to the city which was good. We would definitely recommend a stay here if you are in the area :)
15497982,180920943,2017-08-11,14915398,Heide,The view from the condo is absolutely amazing. We just had a perfect time. 
12605193,523400757,2019-09-03,220466076,Davey,Location is great especially if you plan to see a Bluejays game and visit the many attractions in the local area very close to public transportation to get you to wherever you need to go.
20665369,448740556,2019-05-05,184458687,Steve,Felicia and her place were amazing. My friends and I had a great trip and the place had a lot to do with it. The common area is huge and fit all 9 of us easily. The place was super clean. The location is perfect. Her responses to all my emails were super fast too. I would certainly recommend staying here if you have a large group of people. There are not to many options that will fit 9+ people and I assure you that if you stay here you will not be disappointed.

24755730,307508364,2018-08-14,57467486,Victoria,Yufang’s place was clean stylish and in a great location! Walking distance (about 10-20 min) to all the main attractions!

The location was perfect a short walking distance from where we wanted to go in Toronto. The unit itself was great it was super cute and clean. We appreciated his help and letting us stay in his unit.

24388472,321622832,2018-09-10,49727178,Isadora,"Let’s start with:  we couldn’t get in the building - the buzzer wouldn’t work as we arrived there. 
Finally she spoke to the concierge as he gave us access to the  floor. 

We get at the suite the handle is broken we can’t open the door. My husband had to slam the door we finally got in. 

Get in the washroom pubic hair on the little “soap” and “shampoo “ she gives to the guests. No hairdryer. 

Fire alarms are activated all the time early in the morning.

Elevators stopped working several times. Note that we are on the 42th floor. We missed many meetings. ( we did went down 42 floors by stairs I don’t recommend) 

The place is dark lots light burned asked to change they never did. 

I canceled my stay and went to somewhere else. 

Don’t make the same mistake I made on getting that place."

19831971,438847848,2019-04-17,135099099,Jennifer,Chic and comfortable! Incredible views and so close to many fun activities. My husband and I and our teen boys were comfortable in this relatively small space. We were able to cook a simple breakfast in the kitchen.
4525382,62685173,2016-02-16,42228887,Robert,John & Jenny made us feel EXTREMELY welcome. All the information we required during our stay was meticulously documented and readily accessible. They communicated with me the whole trip and made themselves available for any questions. The neighborhood was very nice quiet and extremely close to the downtown area. We couldn't have asked for better hosts on our first visit to the Toronto area. Thank you so much we cant wait to return!
37599735,522772661,2019-09-02,183028001,Klaudia,"Amazing host (including Juno his rescue dog). I am constantly on the go from work to school and this home is very quiet in a lovely neighborhood. Very close to street cars and Roncesvalles neighborhood/ queen st west .

Super clean and quiet. Michael was always making sure I had everything and was very accommodating . 

Had a very nice stay :)"
7602269,199982231,2017-10-03,148539822,Kiri,This lovely and spotless Yorkville apartment is in a restored Victorian home and is perfect in every way!  It is a four minute walk from Whole Foods Market and there is a full kitchen with a modern range for cooking.  We found great local restaurants a short stroll from the apartment and a cafe at the corner.  We walked to the ROM and to U of T and the subway was only 10 minutes away.  We felt very lucky to have found Elizabeth's place!
9651151,156102033,2017-05-29,38936831,Leanna,We LOVED our stay at Harry's place. Not only was the room beautiful but Harry was so helpful with giving us suggestions on cool places to visit and eat. He made our stay comfortable and enjoyable. We'd definitely stay here again if we were in Toronto!
16235236,553568957,2019-10-24,135543575,Tarah,You are really great nice patient host. It is like you are in an Hotel 5 stars.
28833053,458937344,2019-05-26,158907067,Meghan,Very happy with our stay and Fran's communication. The unit was clean and spacious for our group of 6 people. The beds were comfortable and the location worked perfectly for walking to nearby locations in Toronto. Fran was always quick to respond to our questions and was able to provide a few items we requested upon arrival. Would recommend this location in Toronto.

29817480,468907748,2019-06-13,63992131,Bing,I and my family had a good time while staying in Brendan's house. It was such a lovely and  beautiful house. It was clean and well maintained. I also do appreciate that the host gave chocholates to my kids. Moreover everything was prepared well for us during our stay in Toronto. Very recommended  accomodation. Thanks Brendan
25446479,444216651,2019-04-27,257801993,Yan,The place was clean and really nice. Nicer than the picture. I had a great stay
8427466,101294252,2016-09-12,82198913,Emily,My family had a great experience staying at Mike's house! I booked the house on behalf of my in-laws and coordinated all the details with Mike and he made them feel very comfortable and at home. He communicated really well with me leading up to their arrival so I didn't have to worry about them getting into the house. He was a great host and they had an awesome time. The neighbourhood is beautiful and really convenient to get around and my brother in law used the bikes that Mike left in the garage so he was able to tour High Park and check out some of the more central areas. 
3176828,18904088,2014-09-02,19874016,Peter,Emily and her husband were great hosts. The room was clean and quiet (besides a few brief disruptions from the neighbours) and I was able to accomplish my goal for the week of securing a rental lease in Toronto thanks to the fast Internet.  The neighbourhood was nice and safe and close to everything in the downtown and to U of T.  I will recommend this place in the future to friends looking for cheap accommodation for a visit to Toronto.
19701022,222318783,2017-12-29,127973798,Steph,Tout était comme la description
11624582,452070293,2019-05-12,187888727,Mary,"Pros:
1. Gabriel & Sarah’s place is a walking distance to a wide-array of dining establishments. We loved the convenience!
2. The home is well-insulated. Although the outdoor temperature was very cold the temperature inside the home stayed nice and cozy (without turning on the heater).
3. The bed mattresses were comfortable. 
4. The hosts were hospitable and respectful of our privacy and communicated with us as needed through Airbnb.

Cons:
1. Because the home is located near a subway station you can hear the subway trains arrive/depart at frequent intervals. This becomes particularly bothersome when you’re trying to  get some rest & sleep for the night. Three of us (out of 4) are light-sleepers. 
2. We stayed at Gabriel & Sarah’s for 4 nights. We were awaken early on 2 separate days (before 7:30am on one of 2 days) by loud footsteps from above the ceiling that sounded like a combination of walking and running footsteps (children?).
3. There’s one bathroom that can only be accessed through the main bedroom. If you’re staying in the other bedroom you will need to go through the main bedroom to use the bathroom. This can be awkward particularly at night when others are sleeping.
4. The kitchen only had coffee cups but no drinking glasses."
10681478,150830365,2017-05-09,107389736,Fiona,Fab apartment doesnt look much from outside but so lovely. It was very clean & super comfy bed. The leather couch very uncomfortable Great location.

12382195,422182484,2019-03-10,90339452,Alycia,Super clean super cozy and stylish. Brenda's place is the perfect spot to stay to explore Leslieville. Brenda was SO attentive and responsive; it truly felt like home away from home. We would definitely stay here again :)

5122953,236106917,2018-02-18,19933629,Celina,Buyer beware . The pictures of this condo are only ONE of the units that this renter owns . I encourage the renter to post the photos of all of the units they rent out  as guests have a right to select the actual suite they will be staying in . The room I showed up to upon check in only shared the same beautiful view and layout that the pictures portray. Nothing else was the same . The bedding  decorations  style and upgrades that the pictures demonstrate are no where near the same as the room I arrived at . Not to mention the condo had underwent a wild party the night before which we only found out about upon arrival to broken furniture spilt drinks and scuffed walls  and a broken balcony door which was unable to shut. I appreciate the partial compensation the renter offered us after quite some time of expressing our disappointment over the phone  and I genuinely do feel for the renters of having to undergo such serious damage to their unit. However  I encourage the renter to provide such information to the guest as soon as they realize the terrible conditions of the condo  so that the guest can decide if they would like to continue with the reservation instead of being “stuck with it”.
6170154,218006751,2017-12-10,26904821,Benedict,"David is a friendly and helping host. We had some trouble finding the parking lot since it lies behind the house. He was available for us on the day we arrived to help us find the expected parking space. He stayed in touch during our stay and made sure that we do not miss anything during our stay. 
The apartment itself is very comfortable and the location itself is very convenient since it is close to the subway to reach downtown. One thing to remark is that there was no frying pan which made it hard to cook something by yourself."

28156206,550897674,2019-10-19,134079093,Victoria,The stay at self was great no complains they were quick to respond and communication was great! However when we arrived the host said the door will be unlocked and that wasn’t the case. We had to wait outside of the door for almost an hour until she arrived and opened the door for us. When we walked in the whole living room and kitchen was messy. We had to wait another 15 mins till the host cleaned everything up. She apologized but that’s about it didn’t say or offer anything else.
33407501,459481435,2019-05-27,247315263,Thomas,Agréable mais un peu petit pour 3 ou 4 personnes. Néanmoins les hôtes sont très chaleureux !
2319682,123970401,2016-12-31,66604647,Zachary,Great little loft space to stay in. Perfect for 1 to 2 people very comfortable and lots of nice natural light. Quiet and cozy have pretty much everything you need in the kitchen and Adrian was nice enough to leave us homemade cookies and basics in the fridge like drinks and condiments.   Adrian is very easy going on the ball with communication and made us feel right at home. Would stay again! Thanks Adrian! 
4951472,49029338,2015-09-30,33372166,James,"Very nice space!  I loved having my private living area - it felt like home.

Very friendly hosts. The whole experience was easy and efficient. 

My only warning to anyone looking at this place is that the 15 minute walk downtown is past some pretty unfortunate homeless people. It didn't bother me but nervous types might not like it. 

I would definitely stay with Dale again !"
10354275,503225801,2019-08-05,8866713,Inga,"Die Wohnung von Susan ist super um

31224049,458937723,2019-05-26,32535237,Jesus,"We spent a great weekend at Nick’s house. It is beautifully appointed with antique furniture and brand new appliances. The first floor is open concept with a fantastic kitchen/eating area.
All of us enjoyed the spacious and bright bedrooms and the very confortable beds.
The garden is large and full of greenery and flowers.
We were in Toronto for my daughter’s wedding and the happy couple took their First Look pictures there.
The location was excellent with a great little restaurant and a convenience store just in front of the house.
Nick was very helpful and always replied promptly to our inquiries.
We would definitively stay at Nick’s in the future!"

The house itself was beautiful in an excellent location not too close but not too far from the city centre and in a very quiet neighbourhood. If I visit Toronto again then I'd want to stay here again."
31175715,424413080,2019-03-16,235991699,Nonso,Andrew’s place was beautiful and clean. His location was perfect and it was walking distance from the CN tower Ripleys nice restaurants markets and the train station. He responds very fast and is helpful throughout your stay.

4653024,74321097,2016-05-14,44218361,Clara,"Cristina no solamente es una excelente anfitriona también es una excelente compañera para conversar de la vida compartir el tiempo libre y conocer la ciudad. Estuvo pendiente de mi todo el tiempo desde mi llegada hasta el último día. Compartió sus cenas conmigo me enseñó cómo moverme en la ciudad fue cómplice de mi leche achocolatada con galletas aunque también me enseñó a comer saludable! Me ayudó con mis maletas y hasta me regaló un morral para mis estudios :) !! Fuimos de compras juntas y aprendí de sus proyectos DIY.  Siempre estuvo atenta a que estuviera cómoda y no me dejó sola cuando necesité ayuda con mis traslados y con el idioma. Cristina es amable divertida ingeniosa y muy servicial. La casa es muy acogedora equipada con todo lo necesario para cocinar un baño recién remodelado y buena calefacción. Lo mejor es que está ubicada en una zona muy conveniente cerca a Downtown a supermercados librería pública estación de bus etc. El barrio es muy tranquilo y bonito con casas grandes y con un parque en frente de casa para relajarse y respirar aire fresco. 

Recomiendo 100% el lugar y 100000% a Cristina! Quedamos en hacer planes en verano en algún bello parque de Toronto. 

Pd. Cristina tiene una gatita adorable que vive en el garaje. Es bastante amistosa y consentida ideal para quienes nos gustan los animales :) Para quienes no yo me enteré que existía 2 días antes de irme jajajajaja...."

21748991,252172850,2018-04-09,107303441,Alex,I loved the location and view. Great that it was close to Union Station. Ripley’s aquarium CN tower Air Canada centre and Roger’s Centre are all within walking distance and visible from this place as well. The only thing we struggled a little bit with was retrieving the key and the later check since our flight arrived early but she did let us drop off our bags before check in time.
22676052,295891426,2018-07-24,1339940,Jonathan,I really really enjoyed my short stay in this stylish apartment in a great neighborhood. We walked to “The Pearl Diver” for a great dinner and got to see some beautiful architecture on the one-mile stroll between. What a lovely city!

She gave a map of how to get there along with some restaurant suggestions . She was very prompt replying to any questions we had and if I was back in Toronto I’d stay again."

6755327,51299158,2015-10-19,773173,Gabriela,Matt was amazing! My in-laws come to stay for a few days and they loved the place and location and how attentive Matt was! Thank you Matt! The only unfortunately thing was - which was totally my fault - that the house is not great for older people that need to get up a couple of times during the night. They had to go up or down the stairs which is not very practical for 70+ yr old people. Nothing to do with Matt and the apartment but it's good to remember these things with renting a place for others!

1009656,29855433,2015-04-13,22191353,Aline,Me and my friends had a lovely stay at Holly and Chad's apartment. It's wonderfully furnished with a warm and homey feeling and enough space to comfortably accommodate four people. The both of them were really nice too and responded to any questions immediately. Except for the long walk to the closest subway station or grocery store we can definitely recommend staying here.

18970777,268042762,2018-05-23,50743609,Shanon,John’s place was great! The location was awesome and he was super helpful. The beach was less than a block away and there were lots of awesome bars and restaurants in walking distance. It was also super close to public transit! I would definitely stay here again. It was a great value!
21411007,277482640,2018-06-16,142143728,David,I would definitely recommend staying here - it's in an excellent location clean and the hosts were very accommodating.  My group arrived in the morning after a red-eye flight and was able to get early check-in at 11 AM instead of the scheduled 5 PM which we greatly appreciated.

18308187,335940288,2018-10-13,19053536,Rod,Sean’s condo is fantastic.   The view is phenomenal from this corner unit and everything is as advertised.  Sean is an amazing communicator and answers all questions within a few minutes.

9826723,186792782,2017-08-25,34645037,Priyanka,"Ivy was a great hostattentive and  very helpful with our early morning check in request ( we arrived at 9 AM instead of the 3.00 PM check in time) and she was also great to connect with before the booking and during the booking despite having tooting troubles with Airbnb while booking 

In terms of the place i read in one of the reviews that it's actually better than pics and i have to agree the place absolutely bedazzled us and we were extremely happy with the set up and cleanliness.  

Location is perfect with a great view of CN tower from the endless pool on roof deck which alone is worth the price you pay here :)

We just came back yesterday but are already looking forward to our next visit to Toronto and staying at Ivy's pad again.."
21500140,268042972,2018-05-23,13554375,Jane,The house is spacious with three bedrooms. It looks quite modern with all amenities needed. We had 4 people but got 3 bedrooms which are really handy. Peter is very responsive which we find very helpful. The only downside is that 2 bedrooms are downstairs which look like basement rooms. Windows are tiny which made rooms very dark. Fortunately we are usually out in the day so it doesn’t look too bad when it gets dark when all lights are on. Considering its very reasonable price and quite popular location I think this is a quite good choice. Thank you Peter!
32781031,424397237,2019-03-16,16470912,Elena,Staying at Marlena's was lovely and convenient. She is right off Bloor and near a subway stop plus there is free parking n her driveway! We did not stay very long with her but the short time was enjoyable. I liked the funky touches in her house and comfortable bed. We would stay with her again!
16336524,452646327,2019-05-13,219779979,Shohon,Neat and tidy place amazing location though it does get a little warm. Great hosts so overall good experience.
36146621,508226549,2019-08-12,84754541,Eduardo,We had a great stay!  The location is super convenient!  Communication with the host was very good and fast since before check-in.  We were in a group of 7 adults + a baby and were well accommodated in the apartment.  Would definitely return.
4721087,530165504,2019-09-15,229916813,Jacob,"Great location you can’t beat it.
It’s walking distance to all sorts of dining and shopping.
The place is clean has a nice balcony and the bed is comfortable.
The room is not very sound proof and if you are looking for quiet this location may not be ideal as neighbours in surrounding buildings and the sound of the parking garage opening at night is quite noticeable.
The check in process went smooth but there is a slight sense of
Unease with there being no short term rentals allowed in the building. You get over it and getting in and out is smooth as the host responds to the call quite quickly.
Other than that it was great!"
29153243,555351209,2019-10-27,228415236,Louise,Great location great host!

7834160,177696629,2017-08-03,60036687,Brigitte,Ricky et Judy sont des hôtes merveilleux. Leur maison parfaitement située est proche de tous commerces restaurants et transports. Nous sommes arrives le 1er soir a minuit avec 5 heures de retard. Rick nous attendait et a pris le temps de nous faire un plan pour notre visite du lendemain. La maison est arrangée avec beaucoup de goût. La réalité est plus sympa encore que les photos. La chambre est calme et climatisée comme tout le reste de l'appartement. Il est très bien équipé et Ricky et Judy ont pensé à laisser des produits alimentaires ou de toilettes très appréciable lorsque l'on arrive tard. Nous sommes restés 3 nuits et y avons vecu a 3 personnes adultes facilement. Nous avons quitté avec regrets la maison et Rick et Judy que nous remercions très sincèrement. Nous vous recommandons cette superbe adresse!

27029126,488812871,2019-07-15,237284154,Hana,For us as a family was important the UP connection (3 min walk) to city (1 stop to CN tower - 8 minutes) and easy UP connection to Pearson Airport (2 stops - app. time to terminal 3 was 35 min). In walk distance (3 min) grocery open 700 - 2200. Kitchen is ready to cook. If we travel again to Toronto we would stay here.
17158410,368938945,2019-01-08,126941766,Donald,Great place to stay. Central to all tourist locatons and great restaurants. Very chic and quite location with onsite workout area and convenient parking. Would definitely stay again
24281581,539540263,2019-10-01,293854838,Jonathan,We loved our stay at Shaunna's apartment!  It's bright stylish and clean.  It immediately felt like home and we spent tons of time relaxing there having guests over and enjoying the great location.  We would stay there again and recommend it to anyone!
27460918,528673208,2019-09-13,9142486,Vicki,The location was exactly what we needed. Checking in was easy!
4410388,342813404,2018-10-29,4819795,Kevin,Chris' place was great. My fiancé and I stayed here with another couple. Centrally-located beautiful view of the CN tower.
7390728,54657333,2015-11-22,18419082,Emily,Monique and Jym were very welcoming and provided great information on good places to eat nearby. They were easy to get a hold of when I had questions which I really appreciated. Their house is located in an awesome part of town and was within walking distance of everything a person could need. It was a great space that the hosts obviously take pride in. I would definitely recommend this to others!
3042016,104173943,2016-09-25,44464839,Miranda,Shelly and her husband were so lovely and welcoming very helpful and accommodating to us! The apartment is very big (bigger than the pictures portray). It had everything we needed and the neighbourhood is beautiful and very safe. Thanks so much Shelly!
20362540,289534729,2018-07-12,40860063,Lynn,I had been Mel’s house for 3 months so that I was able to enjoy my jorney. Mel and her family are very respecful and friendly. If you need some help you can ask them. The house is clean and Mel is very tidy. Also finch west subway station is close so you can reach downtown easily. It takes 30-40minutes. Also Walmart is nearby so convenient. I miss Mel so much
15115210,567406886,2019-11-22,309893187,Ahmed,Really nice place

30793099,444233967,2019-04-27,115858035,Douglas,I can’t recommend Luxury Suites enough - just outstanding in every facet. These guys are pros. Full. Stop. Book them when you’re in Toronto. 5 ⭐️
15970302,246044020,2018-03-24,317570,Andrew,I had a great stay in Chris's apartment! Communication on check in and check out was super easy— and it even extended into the clear house manual for how to control things like the heat television etc. The apartment was exactly as she presents it and it was remarkably quiet. I'd definitely recommend the unit to anyone who needs to be close to downtown.
8115809,104498385,2016-09-26,35631513,Christina,Loved staying at their place! Great location clean and comfy! Even left us water bottles and a great list of local restaurants to try! Would love to come back! 
2078597,79395422,2016-06-12,2834083,Amy,"This place is AMAZING! It is better than the pictures. Super clean and lovely. The neighbourhood is super cool .. delicious coffee right across the street and tons of cool shops and restaurants just minutes away.
It is obvious that these guys care about their guest's experience and have put a lot of thought and effort into creating a home away from home. They are totally available as needed but not at all in your face. 
Perfect all around!"
13121978,514641306,2019-08-21,223844076,Jaslyn,Armando and Brian are great hosts with a great apartment. Fully equipped kitchen washer and dryer makes travelling easier. Location is super as it is pretty near to grocery stores like Loblaws and FreshCo. Leslieville seems a cool place too. Hosts are quick and informative in replies too. Thanks again!
13174614,428972527,2019-03-26,83155577,Dani,Very accommodating hosts called to make sure everything was ok. The place was cute and stylish and amenities/location were a plus. Thank you for a wonderful stay and I’ll book this place again the next time I’m in Toronto.
22615092,476107511,2019-06-25,164332888,Vickie,We absolutely loved our time in Toronto! This home was amazing fantastic views and location. Special thanks for the extra special touches such as the thank you card and wine on arrival. Could not recommend highly enough!! ☺️
12042727,503849963,2019-08-06,22186524,Lauren,Kim’s place is amazing! You can’t beat the  location and stunning accommodations. It really is a retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. We celebrated my bachelorette here. Kim was so thoughtful  to welcome us to her home with dessert and Rose!
7131751,239400679,2018-03-01,76412,Krista,This place is as listed though perhaps not quite as bright and big as in photos. Vincent was great with communication and his mother does a fantastic job of cleaning! Be aware that this is definitely a no frills situation but it was functional and clean. There is a strong mold odour in the staircase entrance area so if you have sensitivities be aware. Also noise from upstairs can be a problem if they have guests - there was a party until 6am one night that kept me awake. But if you plan to be out on the town it’s a good spot!
5681246,303063907,2018-08-06,6780193,Catherine,Hosts were very welcoming and always available. The space is stylish and clean. The bed is comfortable and the outdoor patio area is perfect for warm summer days. My friends and I really enjoyed our experience. Louis-Philippe and Tyrone truly are Airbnb super hosts and recommend their space to all fellow travelers. Merci :)
28524511,431158376,2019-03-31,141227745,Skyler,Very clean and spacious place. Well designed and very cozy. Bathroom was very clean and the kitchen had everything we needed. Definitely would recommend staying here again.

The host has prepared free coffee tea French fries and coke and it's amazing.
Communication with the host is also more fluent."
21835119,331411957,2018-10-02,31281845,Benjamin,Amazing basement well located in the city (not downtown but close enough to everything by public transport) and easy to find. Communication with James was great! Big basement super clean and beautifully decorated! If I had to say one negative thing it would be the noise that you can hear from upstairs it woke the 4 of us up early in the morning but apart from that it was all perfect. Even after our stay James was available to answer our questions.
20125048,221992245,2017-12-28,163112676,Carson,Location was great for me and it was very clean

Danke für alles!!"
5003079,199300114,2017-10-01,33049716,Sébastien,Mon séjour avec la famille Evans a vraiment été super. J'ai été très bien accueilli par Tamara et Richard et les deux enfants qui ont été adorables lors de mon séjours avec eux. La maison est situé à 7 min à pieds du métro 2 très pratique pour aller downtown en 20-30 minutes. La maison est très propre. La salle de bain toute neuve au même étage que la chambre est vraiment super. Si vous avez besoin d'un logement temporaire je vous recommande la famille Evans. Ils sont vraiment très gentils et très arrangeants. 100% satisfaits. Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés.
8355488,178983595,2017-08-06,38040126,Marieme,Nice & very clean apartment in downtown Toronto...very well equipped & well taking care of.CJ was a great host and fast communicator.The view is not the best it is facing a parking lot but the cleanness & cuteness of the apartment make up for it & CJ was just amazing and nice.Thank you CJ!
28963462,499576917,2019-07-31,244934871,Daniel,"The only word I can use to describe my stay was disappointing. DO NOT BE MISLED BY THE TERM ""newly rennovated"". Here is a list of all inconsistencies at the apartment:

• The door shade was stained with black marks and flaking and it doesnt cover the entire door glass. It was very dirty and discolored so were both blinds on either side of the door with one of the blinds being broken. The blinds were not able to be adjusted comfortably. It is far from what the pictures on the AirBnb description depicted. 
• According to the AirBnb description ""has an outdoor patio PERFECT FOR SUMMER"". The patio was filled with 3 wooden chairs 2 with broken seating padding and one without any padding at all making it impossible to sit. The patio was similar to a dump with two buckets filled with debris and discarded egg trays laying around. If that wasn't bad enough there were used Tim Horton cups laying around along with a filled bucket of water that can be a breeding ground for all types of insects etc. I can't come to terms with paying a cleaning fee and having an unsanitary patio. This was totally unacceptable. 
• The television was also defective with lines coming across the screen causing the output to be blurred; similar to looking at a 3D movie without any 3D glasses. Again this was not stated/seen within the description of the apartment. 
• The stove provided in the apartment had one missing burner and was not connected to any gas apparatus therefore making it impossible to use. Therefore the statement that guests can cook their own meals was extremely misleading. Also there were no pots and pans as stated in the description of the amenities. Again why is this stated in the amenities if these things were not provided? Disappointing.
• The wifi connection in the apartment was inconsistent making internet use tedious. It was stated in the amenities as continuous wifi access however within each half hour or less (sometimes minutes) I encountered many drops.
• Air Conditioning is NOT provided within the AirBnb yet it is stated in the amenities that air conditioning is provided. This made resting at night really uncomfortable. Only one fan was provided.
• Lastly on July 26th around mid-morning - my mother who was at the time alone was laying in bed very comfortably dressed only to be greeted with two gentlemen of chinese descent who entered without any prior announcement. They entered straight into the room startling her in the process; their explanation was that they came to clean broken glass within the building so they decided to visit our apartment to vacuum as they were in close proximity. That was totally UNACCEPTABLE and an invasion of one's privacy and personal space. How could you enter a place that someone paid for unannounced without notifying the person prior to your arrival? 

I would not reccomend my worst enemy to stay at this place. I have everything documented via images and videos as will which I will make available on social media platforms and all travel advisory platforms. It's a pity images and videos are not allowed on Airbnb reviews."
13992933,410090351,2019-02-09,123498236,Ariel,Eric’s spot is lovely. Everything was comfortable felt like a little home away from home. Highly recommend booking!
16243949,310572367,2018-08-19,123887099,Eva,GREAT Area!! The apartment is a studio with one bathroom and a kitchen. The bar downstairs isn't loud and it very nice. 
21139661,295435311,2018-07-23,188016265,Aaron,Lesya's condo was perfect for a stay in downtown Toronto. Only two minutes from the ACC every amenity you could want or need was within walking distance. The condo was clean and comfortable and the view was amazing! Lesya was always available for communication and was very accommodating.

34820946,512814411,2019-08-18,39192966,Jayesh,We were in Toronto for 2 nights and did not want to spend much on accommodation and Pete’s place was a perfect choice it was definitely value for money. Located very near to a subway station and in the heart of the city very near to the main downtown area. We had a very comfortable stay overall.
2447970,260080245,2018-05-03,144688095,Kai,Vicky's place is so convenient to practically everywhere in Toronto downtown. The room and bed are very comfortable to stay and the night view is amazing too. Vicky is very easy to talk with I'll definitely going back to stay again!

12211908,245394141,2018-03-22,97236520,Lynette,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
20816907,344079633,2018-11-02,59782530,Kelly,"It was really a pleasure to stay at Dan’s place - very convenient for me as I did not have a car and could walk to work. Other necessities were also within walking distance or a short transit ride away (Grocery Stores etc). I felt very comfortable in this cosy fully equipped studio! Rick (the cohost) was also very attentive when I couldn’t find something. 
As far as location goes it is great - quiet but close to shops and amenities and a major mall. It is also a short walk to the main subway line that took me downtown. 
I didn’t have any issues with electrical cables as a previous guest indicated and would certainly stay here again . In fact I have already asked Dan if it’s available in a couple of weeks :) Thanks Dan !"
8009520,66429587,2016-03-22,57570069,Shiying,This experience is really great! Dan is pretty nice he told me that living like our home. The location is great and it's really near the chinatown and markets that makes a lot convenience. And I love the style of  kitchen with the bar!  It's really a good choice to live in this loft.

The room was clean and well stocked and Sam was quick to respond to messages.

We'd definitely stay here agin in the future."

The bedroom is spacious and flooded with natural light."
122492,148858907,2017-05-01,1413486,Akil,"The hosts are fantastic and very quick to respond to any needs. Further more they go out of their way to make sure you are ok.

This is a massive basement apartment that has more light than some above ground apartments. It is decorated like a picket fence cottage far away from the city with tons of antiques!

It's fairly easy to use this home as a base if you are driving. It's immediately next to the highway entrance! If you're taking public transport it's convenient in that there are a lot of busses nearby but it will still take you some time to get into downtown. Maybe 30-45 minutes depending where you are going. 

A few things to note. The home is closer to O'Connor than it is to Danforth. After walking to Danforth once you probably won't want to do it again. Second the heating is controlled upstairs by the host. They're good at adjusting it if you need more or less heat but some people may be picky about having real time control. Third the house is undergoing renos at the moment (can't imagine it lasting much longer) so the entrance to the apartment and the laneway is unfinished. At night the lane is dark so just be careful if it's raining (uneven gravel) or equipment/strollers/bicycles are in the path. 

If you can see through these things it's a great place to stay with very friendly hosts!

30519854,365678017,2019-01-01,135179403,Fiona,Great well lit and spacious apartment with an location. It’s close to a grocery store (Fiesta Farms) and a cute little coffee and pastry place (Morellina’s) as well as walking distance from the metro. Small details like heated bathroom floor well furnished kitchen and wide book selection really made this place feel like a home away from home!
32923272,557680115,2019-11-01,38149932,Santosh,Perfect Location.. nearby to public transportation.. Beaches and near to Downtown! What more can you expect.. on top of that Micheal and his team are fantastic hosts!!

3987246,45544276,2015-09-03,35227349,Tristan,Elaine and Greg have a beautiful place that has clean and refreshingly modern renovations within an unassuming Cabbagetown home. The interior was bright safe and comfortable. The location was a little farther East than I anticipated but it is perfect location if you are spending time downtown around Queen and Dundas E. They really care about running a great B&B and it shows! 
31686308,503282608,2019-08-05,130903434,Li,房子地段真好!住着安全舒适!房东是中国人很好交流｡
13476773,114308061,2016-11-17,7194776,Richard,"Good place well located in a cosy area full of coffee shops and organic markets. Not too far from the centre whether you rent a bike or use the public transports (many tram and buses near the place).
Tho I didn't meet them in person The hosts are nice and it's easy to communicate with them. They're also very helpful.

The cons : 
Can a bit noisy sometimes mainly due to the street. 
Bed is big  but also a bit uncomfortable (2 separate matelas in the bed and thin)


In conclusion good place to stay for the price for one or 2 persons!"
14731808,171031694,2017-07-16,15246542,Mengxuan,Nice location close to many shopping stores an d restaurants. Upstairs have people steps around in the morningI am a light sleeperso it's a little noisy to me. If you okey with that I think you will be fine. Easy check-in & outNico 
599591,13772207,2014-06-03,9726885,Val,Michelle was a lovely host! She responded to my msgs promptly and let us use her surrounding garden and space. The apartment has everything you need! It is cozy decorative and quiet fresh for the hot summer. It's close to everything- right next to a mall beer store lovely parks and lively neighborhoods! I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone and would stay here again. Thanks Michelle!

29461000,353357384,2018-11-27,70136420,Meg,Great place! Clean and fashionable but the heating is too slow and cannot reach the setting temperature.
16674001,368300769,2019-01-06,165262660,Seth,Tina and Dave were amazing hosts. Their place is in the perfect spot in Toronto. You can walk to all of the major attractions in the city! I have never been happier with an Airbnb host!
25766845,346692864,2018-11-09,216738505,Francheska,Marina’s place is so accurate! What you see in pictures is that and even better. We enjoyed so much our stay in her place. She was so kind and very careful to us! She respond very fast every text and she also wrote us to know how we were doing it and in case we needed something! The place was very clean and neat. The view is perfect. I recommend 100% this place! I will returned!
26171003,414405516,2019-02-19,17684789,David,Very good place for the price. Don’t expect luxury but definitely what you paid for. Dont forget the place has a designated parking spot. Im my situation (traveling by car) it was an excellent feature. Andrey is quick to respond for anything you might need.

26565222,343428882,2018-10-31,87102469,Hugo,Great apartment with an amazing view.
22357218,257825711,2018-04-27,184854448,Kathryn,Ayman and his son were very welcoming and friendly hosts.  My concern is that the room I rented was connected to another guest's sleeping space.  I knew the room was listed as part of 'shared space' but thought it was a room down the hall from the host or other guests.  In fact I had to walk past the other guest's bed to access any other part of the unit including the bathroom.  This was very awkward for both of us.  The room I rented was also in a basement and although very tidy it was quite damp.  I strongly recommend revising the listing for this room and installing a dehumidifier.
6093959,249082867,2018-04-01,65825433,Bill,Cip is a good host. Gives clear directions and instructions; very responsive to needs/questions. Condo has a great view and in good location. The add on Air B&B is accurate. Actually the place is nicer in person than the pictures show. I would stay there again.
17652665,153987494,2017-05-22,98619276,Dat,Magnifique condo très propre et facile d'accès : 20min du centre-ville autoroute à proximité.

16347745,244443750,2018-03-18,102396090,Forrest,Lara was quick to respond and detailed in response. The space was clean and unique in style. A tram stop was just out the front door. A short 25 minute walk to downtown core. Just a five minute walk to Church Street.

18849936,197082075,2017-09-24,47201770,Meghan,We loved Robin's place. Convenient location and easy to access public transportation. Super clean and lovely loft. Close to a variety of good places to eat.
24472061,509534336,2019-08-14,86245506,David,"Possibly the best location on the block. Everything looks just like the pictures if not better. Azita is very quick to respond to messages and even printed out a parking permit for me. Everything was clean and tidy. She had different pamphlets with things to do and eat around location. 

Only draw back was location as I wish it were closer to downtown. It is about 20-30 min drive. That could be user error and not doing more investigating. Also the middle room there’s a door which lead to another entry way and was loud at times from people entering or exiting. 

Overall I would recommend this stay and would hope this review helps for future stays."
23924383,335563802,2018-10-12,144501480,Alberto,El Dpto esta muy bien ubicado es pequeño pero para máximo 6 personas esta bien. Un poco confuso el acceso al departamento y el anfitrion no nos regresó la llamada.
14586613,367807162,2019-01-05,26530766,Thiago,"In general the experience was amazing! 

The one thing that left us disappointed was the construction site blocking the view to CN tower we suggest the units profile pictures to be updated.

Besides that we strongly recommend Moe & Mindy’s we loved the apartment and its location Moe was very kind and quick to respond any questions!"
6029261,42381143,2015-08-13,27985589,Dhana,Our vacation in Toronto was excellent it's a beautiful city to visit and the apartment is in prime location to all sites shops all within 10-20mins walking distance from the apartment. There are even good bar and food places down outside the building Hunters Landing being a particular favorite and a great atmosphere especially when the Blue Jays or Argonauts are playing!
15512850,134988415,2017-03-02,114740142,Jeff,Very satisfied with this accommodation - easy access to downtown via TTC and excellent value compared to hotel.

30377858,517490183,2019-08-25,13271244,Cindy,Excellent location clean but I would not say that it is a “luxury” penthouse given the amenities and furnishings
20600488,314298827,2018-08-26,5625665,Christian,Very friendly host! Great location if you're interested in some great late night hangout spots and good food. You can't beat this price for all that is offered here.

10393368,137776164,2017-03-17,7611067,Meghan,Absolutely seamless and lovely experience staying at Stuart's place. I travel a lot for business and found this more comfortable clean and far more convenient than a hotel. I would highly recommend to fellow business travelers or could see this being a fabulous accommodation for tourists. Also really appreciated Stuart's quick communication during the blizzard which effected my travel plans.

Check in was super easy especially bringing family from the airport late at night. The house was immaculate - beautiful and so clean. The kitchen is well-equipped. Jordan and Lesley were extremely responsive - answering my questions very fast and arranging parking permits for our stay. The house is located in a quiet residential neighbourhood close to Roncy ave with loads of shops cafes and restaurants and just minutes to transit. 
It was so nice to bring our relatives visiting from overseas into a comfortable and wonderful space after a long day of travel. 
Lesley and Jordan are great hosts and I would recommend them to anyone! "
28201189,509530080,2019-08-14,51175206,Thao,"Kathleen apartment is very central: the bus stops are a minute away & it's a short ride to Hyde Park downtown or to Dundas west subway or Bloor UPEx station. There are a lot of eateries cafe & shops within a short walking distance too. The place is very clean & you'll be greeted with a very nice host & a cute poodle. Kathleen was really flexible & accomodating with check in and out which is great for those with a short layover Toronto

The room faces a busy street so there can be some traffic noise at night but it wasn't an issue for me"
21447146,247481419,2018-03-28,177517737,Jolene,Victor was very responsive and his place is great - centrally located in downtown very walkable. Great experience!
3364091,16482029,2014-07-28,17119868,Veronica,"This house was perfect for us. We needed a kids and pet friendly house to stay for a month and this place was exactly that. It has a little backyard were we sat every morning to watch the squirrels go around.  It has an amazing park just a few steps from the house I believe most of the neighbors have young kids so it was really quiet at night. Roncesavalles in general is a great area with lots of restaurants coffe shops and bakeries. 
The only thing that we did not like was that the second bathroom and the TV were in the basement but more than a bad thing I believe this is a matter of preference. We also had to do some extra cleaning when we arrived but mostly because our son is very sensitive to dust.
Gillian was very helpful and answer all our e-mails and requests very quickly. She also left us her son's train for our son to use during our stay which we found was so nice... he loved the train and play with it every day that we were there. 
We will definitely come back and recommend this place. "
29208109,355558424,2018-12-04,228892908,Damilola,"‭ This condo was beyond everything I expected. 

Key pick up and drop off was seamless all rooms were spotless and the location was ideal. The unit was very cute and cozy and the host provided complimentary toiletries and treats such as mini bottles of shampoo and conditioner which was a pleasant surprise. 

It is easily accessible to public transit literally a 1 minute walk to buses and streetcars. It was very proximate to the Exhibition Place and other places downtown holding holiday festivities.  

Communication was always quick and they were helpful in answering any questions I had. I also appreciated the text messages from the host’s support team re. my stay. 

Customer service was excellent and I would definitely stay here again!"
16005226,304507115,2018-08-09,198375739,Patty,Excellent location with Union Station Ripleys Aquarium  CN Tower within steps. Great communication with our host James. Toronto had severe flooding the night before our stay
13657964,353337222,2018-11-27,138527754,Brandon,Fantastic place to stay. Very clean with all amenities provided. Host was always available to answer questions during the stay.
20904707,270145729,2018-05-28,174962400,Janet,Very nice and clean place. It is worth the price. Leila was great at communicating and responding any question we encounter.  We were there for the weekend to explore Toronto and distance to downtown was just a little much with traffic but this was already stated in the place’s description. Very quiet neighborhood but I was able to hear the children upstairs and for those who have a light sleep this might be a little to consider in the morning (my husband had no problem as he sleeps very deeply). Overall great! Perfect accommodation clean and worth the price! Thank you Leila :)
6611013,35892332,2015-06-22,1968021,Patricia,Louise's house is very calm and close to nature Highpark around the corner and close to the subway which invites you to discover the centres of interest of Toronto. I enjoyed staying two weeks there as Louise is concerned by her hosts' comfort. The house provides all you need and if you have got questions Louise answers right away to your e-mails. I strongly recommand Louise's home for you stays in Toronto.
15545774,135627886,2017-03-05,20739040,Sergio,Joey was very nice. The accomodations are close to the main street. Everything was super clean and neat. The mattress could be improved though!

22126823,265264596,2018-05-16,24723077,Zixi,It’s really worth it to spent 3days in this place! The apartment is nice and clean! Especially the night view is awesome. It located in a really nice area where near to the downtown. So if you like walking you can just go downtown by walk. Also the transit is really convenience!! The street car station is really close to the apartment.

11675421,123503356,2016-12-29,11402231,Daphne,"I probably one of few guests that checked out of a host's place and hours later checked into another one of his places. It all started and ended with Toronto Pearson International what I now consider one of the modern day circles of hell. Long story short I found out I was not going to be able to get out of the airport as scheduled. I panicked! I called David the only person I ""know"" in Toronto and asked if he had any places available? He said ""well I have one but Daphne I just painted it today and it is a mess."" I told him I didn't care I just needed a place to lay my head for a few hours. He said he couldn't let me stay in it in it's current state... that should have been the end right? Not for David ""Host Par Excellence!""  He called me back and said he was going to have Joasette (THANK YOU AGAIN JOASETTE!!) come and clean this place so I could stay in it for what turned out to be 5.5 hours. I really and truly can't thank David and Joasette enough for helping me in my time of need."

The location was perfect - we walked to the ROM the Eaton Centre the Harbourfront and City Hall then explored Kensington Market before heading back. The apartment is cozy and clean with an amazing view of downtown Toronto. I would definitely recommend staying at this AirBnb and I will definitely be back.

14202999,181389407,2017-08-12,137973889,Joan,As a first time Airbnb user I wasn't quite sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised in all respects. I found the information provided ahead of time accurate and helpful. During my stay the host was very friendly and responsive but as the space is completely self-contained I had complete privacy.  The space was roomy and comfortable and met my needs in all ways. I plan to stay here on future visits to Toronto.
14812955,161806043,2017-06-18,35133631,Deanna,Ashley's place was exactly as pictured and perfect for our trip. My dad two sisters and I were in town to see a concert at the Budweiser stage which you can literally see from Ashley's balcony. It was a 15-20 minute walk along the waterfront to the stage. There was enough space for 4 adults to hang out comfortably and the air mattress she left for us actually stayed inflated all night (which i find never happens). As a bonus there is a great cafe called Parisco on the next block that had great food and was so convenient for a quick bite during the duration of our stay! Ashley was amazing to communicate with through the entire process from initial contact through booking and all during our trip. Would definitely recommend! 
14694692,272535889,2018-06-03,67557200,Andy,The location and amenities were perfect..the host Erin was amazing..had a small problem and she responded and took care of immediately..I will stay here again our next trip to Toronto. .great value...

I was working during my stay and was able to use fast WiFi.
Loblaws and Fresh Co opposite so easy for grocery shopping. 
Bus stoped right outside to take you north and only a 5 min walk to the tram into downtown.
Leslieville has so many great shops bars and coffee houses nearby it really made my stay.
Very secure property"

I was getting late for a concert (coming from somewhere else) and she made sure she could do the most to help. I would recommend her place and her hospitality. Thank you for making our trip! The place is also very cute:) 

I put 4 stars for location because of nothing in Tiffanys control. There were just some odd people hanging around the building at night."
3176828,85196028,2016-07-10,81182078,Jenn,"Emeli and Eric were fantastic hosts. My brother and I were there for 3 nights/4 days and we couldn't have asked for better accomodations. We arrived really late at night and they were more than accommodating.

The room was perfect for two adults clean spacious and a great location. We rented a car but ended up walking most of our trip. The air conditioner was a bonus we were not expecting that at all.

Thank you for a great Toronto experience!"

32251160,458101869,2019-05-25,52065072,Ogan,Really good value for the place. The private room was more spacious than I expected and the rest of the place is kept very clean. A 24 hour open store and a decent shawarma place is right across the street and in the same building respectively. 15 minutes of walk to the Shareton.
27935218,480825458,2019-07-03,262111287,Phuong,My family stayed at Leo’s place for 5 days and everything was perfect. His house was super clean and he had everything we need. We had some problem with the toilet upstairs but Leo came and fixed really quick! We were really enjoying our time at Leo’s place.
15127274,204329971,2017-10-17,81560479,Andrea,Great great location with many things in walking distance! The aquarium and CN tower was literally across the street. The place itself was very very clean and smelt great everytime you walked in. There was a fridge and stove and dishwasher and most basic things you would need in a kitchen. Nextflix is even connected on the TV. I would recommend staying here. Irma was great to communicate with and was quick in responsiveness.
15706398,446023461,2019-04-30,28373567,Lan,Nice quiet neighbourhood. We loved that it was near most things for our trip in particular. I am not a bug person there are insects and spider webs everywhere in the suite. Some of us are more squeamish than others (such as myself) so if you hate bugs as much as I do here is the warning you hoped for lol. Jackie was friendly however unresponsive when requesting for a fair refund per her flexible refund policy of the nights not stayed. Airbnb was asked to mediate and I then received my requested refund. Just a small suggestion of a dehumidifier for the basement. Found it extremely moist and it would definitely help with the strong mildew smell.
6794357,185447267,2017-08-21,129883936,Paul,Great location for food and fun shopping in Kensington Market as well as being convenient to everywhere we wanted to go in Toronto. Roomy comfortable and very quiet with a great kitchen and two excellent bathrooms. Hosts were responsive when contacted and invisible when not needed. A perfect AirBNB experience.!

22108167,342295593,2018-10-28,212146203,Rosy,The place is amazing! You can find everywhere you go. Even close to metro to go anywhere by leaving your car. Always respond in messages.
18858392,444218063,2019-04-27,193532759,Julia,This was a great place to stay while visiting the city! Very convenient location only blocks away from great restaurants parks and cafes. The bedroom was relaxing comfortable and cozy! Beth was an amazing host very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend staying here!
20401239,200802704,2017-10-06,20872014,Saad,The area is not the best if you’re looking to be in a more upscale area. It’s a bsmnt apt no AC. The host owns the home and has made both of the above floors as Airbnb units. It’s an old house so you will hear other tenants if they are home. A separate property manager is around quite a bit. She can be bossy at times depending on her mood. But overall if you have a limited budget and want to spend $100 or so a night it’s good.
24017239,251809089,2018-04-08,181682524,Donald,Nice place my daughter loved it.
13020122,513437713,2019-08-19,133837526,可歆,Audrey is a very nice host. Although she was on traveling when we were in her apartment she gave quick responses and helpful advices. The apartment is easy to use. Remember to bring your own laundry soap if you want to wash clothes.

The place is very comfortable and really well kept a very pleasant place to hang around and enjoy the view when there was some down time. Gulia was also a fantastic host making really helpful timely and friendly communications from the moment I booked until when I checked out. The check-in was easy and at a great time for me and Gulia was a great help in being flexible on check out as well! Thanks for everything had a great stay in Toronto from the perfect base :)
6732046,135827866,2017-03-06,35063488,Annie,Me and family had an amazing stay at Joan and Jonathan's place. There apartment is fully furnished super clean and very functional.

26489621,297903792,2018-07-28,8997249,Katie,Valerie’s space is easy to access amazing location and spotlessly clean!

Thanks for a great stay!

20070052,214339458,2017-11-25,155095804,Lorraine,Absolutely the perfect experience in every way! Being my first Airbnb I wasn’t sure what to expect. My husband was having major surgery at St. Joe’s Health Centre and this apartment was less than two blocks from the hospital. I felt very comfortable walking back and forth each day.  The apartment was immaculate and had everything needed to feel like a home away from home. The hosts were excellent and always accessible if I needed anything. They were most accommodating especially in extending my stay and arranging for overnight parking passes. Would highly recommend this location. Roncesvalles Street within walking distance with unique shops bakeries and cafes.

Apartment is small but perfect for 2 as we weren’t in the room too much anyhow as we were out seeing the Toronto sights! Would definitely stay again thank you Todd!
12396450,91039291,2016-08-03,86412130,Shelly,This was our first Airbnb experience and we loved it!   The Apartment was a much better option than the hotel rooms we usually squeeze our family of 5 into.  There was space for everyone and having a kitchen was fantastic with kids.  There is a grocery store just down the street should you wish to eat in.   Everything was very tidy and clean which was wonderful to walk in to as well. Alex and Irina were fantastic at providing a detailed list of everything we would need to know during our stay. They were also kind enough to check in with us to make sure we arrived without any issues. Thanks so much Alex & Irina !

The appartment is well situated for every purpose and everything you might want to do in Toronto is either reachable by walking or using the public transport.

31539644,492623180,2019-07-21,19333840,Lloyd,This flat is a real gem in Toronto. We stayed during heat warnings from Environment Canada and the air con kicked in keeping us nice and comfortable. The place is so unique and stylish. We absolutely loved it. Great couple of restaurants available as well nearby. Great tram bus and subway connections. Can’t recommend it enough. The keyless entry also meant there was one less thing to worry about or forget. Loved it!

27632327,402200004,2019-01-17,40612676,Bethany,Fedora and Jason host a fantastic and cozy little gem that's very easy to get to from the airport. They were more than accommodating of our arrival time due to a flight that arrived later than scheduled and they made sure we had everything we needed. The beds were very comfortable and we slept soundly. We would definitely stay here again. 100% recommend.

32381081,459494018,2019-05-27,27904190,Caitlin,This is such a great space for one or two people looking to explore Old Toronto. Lots of nice bars and restaurants nearby and the apartment is easily located close to both Union Station and the Distillery District. Streetcars are very close. Such a nice view from the balcony as well.

96336,135834227,2017-03-06,23547181,Ina,"The place is fantastic - very clean and good space in the hip part of town. It's walking distance to great cafes and restaurants. And the communal space almost looks better than what you see on the pictures. 

Brenda and John communicate very proactively and clearly. Everything about the house is straightforward. 

We (3 traveling from the UK and the US) stayed for a long weekend and despite very cold weather had a fab time. The house contributed to the relaxation of the weekend. "
17864937,357154585,2018-12-09,35604978,Mahesh,Darius s place was great. He communicated quickly for my queries. Check in was easy with the detailed instructions Darius provided. Room was clean. Kitchen utensils were clearly marked for guests residing in the adjacent rooms. Laundry was in the unit. Best part was the 8 minute walk to the subway. It was super convinient for my purpose of the visit. Overall it was a great place for the price.

10650849,425659402,2019-03-18,33535304,Alina,A perfect stay. The room was a bit more spacious than I expected and it was very cozy. The decor of the room even inspired me for my future room decorating idea. I have a quiet and private personality so I didn’t really interact with the hosts in person and they really respected my choice. I even feel that I was staying there alone because nothing bothered me. It was also very affordable. Hoping I can come back soon :)
27980430,505712902,2019-08-09,272693176,Emily,We had a nice stay at Kevin’s. It is a little far if you are walking but we used the city bikes to get everywhere and there is a docking station at the end of the road which was perfect.
16556492,471438347,2019-06-17,247232,Meghann,This place is wonderfully located on the cutest street just around the corner from Danforth Avenue - the neighborhood really can't be beat especially if you're a family with young children in tow. Great communication and a big comfortable house with a cute backyard for our daughter to run around in. Would stay here again!

Perfect location highly recommended."
14760262,500069046,2019-08-01,276961105,Tomisha,I absolutely loved staying in the condo.  It was conveniently located near the harbor restaurants grocery and many restaurants.  We walked to Chinatown  Graffiti Alley and so many other spots.  The condo was clean and inviting.  The view was spectacular.  Access to public transportation was literally at our door step. I would definitely stay in this space again.  Thanks for sharing your space with us.
14137840,242858299,2018-03-13,90820168,Heather,This was my second stay with John & Laura and that speaks for itself.  It's a clean and comfortable space.  Beautiful bathroom.  Great bed and sofa and a fireplace type heater - very cosy.  There's a very interesting book collection - made me wish I could stay longer to finish the book I couldn't resist starting.  John and Laura are attentive hosts but allow you your privacy if that's what you want.  See you again!
34122067,503137256,2019-08-05,59533512,Charline,Great location Great space close to many restaurants and sights. I truly enjoyed my stay and got to see more of what Toronto has to offer.

31762893,453671286,2019-05-16,238543278,Carrie,Serena's place was perfect for our vacation. It was perfectly located dowmtown close to transit and local attractions. The facilities are a little tricky to find the first time because the building is so large but awesome once you figure it all out. We spent lots of time in the hot tub and pool. Awesome trip! Will book again.
22361310,256728598,2018-04-23,156205640,Won Suk,Amazing place to stay ! Clean place and Charlotte was really nice clear directives and i would love to go back. Thanks for everything :)
22941618,416458359,2019-02-24,243959164,Danielle,If you enjoy beautiful lake views amazing amenities and getting possessed by a spiritual entity at 3am you'll absolutely love your time at this air bnb. This condominium is in an up & coming developing neighborhood that would be an amazing location for the summertime with quick access to the lake shore path. It is about a 15-20 minute walk from downtown and has some very good restaurants close by down the strip. All in all the condo itself was a nice space with amazing features at a decent location just hope that the fire alarm wont go off at 8am.
15132749,136881569,2017-03-12,116986599,Daniela,Great stay with Olivia. Will most definitely recommend to anyone traveling to Toronto. Building is super close to everything. Taxis are around 24/7 for the most part super convenient instead of driving. Restaurants shops etc all around. Blocks away from CN tower. Olivia was extremely helpful and attentive. Great host. Will be back next time we stay in Toronto!

25517185,455509841,2019-05-19,130621048,Sophie,It was difficult to communicate with the host. We finally received check in details with the help of air bnb support the day before our flight. On arrival the lock box would not open.  After multiple phone calls to the host and air bnb we were told the host had to cancel our stay... as we were trying to check in. This was very stressful and we did not have help from air bnb to find a new property to stay in.
7999412,183938703,2017-08-18,33670468,Philippe,Great appartment in a great location. We were 3 adults and 1 kid so the park in front of the house and the pool were so usefull. We did all our activties on foot because almost everything was in a range of a 30 minutes walk. Navid was a great host and very kind to us. I would recommend this place to anyone who's going to Toronto!

Many thanks  for all !!  best wishes  from Chile
12007585,345216602,2018-11-04,59806237,Leah,"Great apartment very centrally located! Had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. James was very quick to respond to my texts as needed. 
Since it is right downtown there is a lot of noise pollution but I expected that and I still slept great as it does  get quiet overnight and the bed was very comfortable.
All-in-all a great experience and I will stay again in the future! :)"
2799305,55985094,2015-12-07,5892365,Catherine,Great location close to highway. Beautiful and clean definitely worth the price. Especially with the parking spot included. I would recommend with no hesitation and will surely rent this location again.

We as a family enjoyed the toys that made our daughters feel home and the position close to the lake and at a very convenient distance to downtown. We were able to live a month without a car remarkable. The neighborhood is great everyone welcomed us and we felt very safe.
Super recommended!!?"

View aside this flat is in a very good location - amazingly convenient for anything in the downtown Toronto core. 
The host was also very friendly and swift to respond to any communication. Great stay - I don't want to higly recommend it because I want it to be available when I'm next in Toronto ..."

A couple of things to keep in mind:
It isn't clean
It's still a work in progress right now. There was no internet in the actual apartment though you can use the internet in the next room easily. I think he was going to fix that though."

Her charming apartment is clean nicely furnished and in the perfect location - right downtown without being surrounded by skyscrapers. 

Kensington Market is such a great area. So many funky little shops and cafes in just a few square blocks. You really could just spend the whole day walking around ""The Market.""  

I would definitely recommend Cara and her apartment and I look forward to staying here again in the future."

Shaun really deserves his 'super host' badge he's very kind flexible on check-in time (I arrived way later than I was supposed to because my train was delayed) and can give you good advice and recommendations (for cheap but good places to eat for example). You'll definitely feel welcome ; if I ever need a place to stay in Toronto again Shaun's will be my #1 choice.

There is s fully loaded roku box.  Just a few minute walk to sky dome and CN tower.   Plenty of restaurants and rooftop patios.  Worth the stay.

19815012,563318529,2019-11-12,66973790,Yvonne,The location is very close to a lot of attractions so it's convenient especially when it's cold (Website hidden by Airbnb) also fairly close to the train and the free parking was a life saver. The apartment was deep cleaned prior to us checking in which was a huge plus and the views from the rooms and balcony are breathtaking. One morning the shower/faucets in the bathrooms weren't working but there was something going on with the building-- not an issue with the apartment itself. When I reached out to Al  he was responsive and tried to figure out what was going on. Would recommend this place!
17547979,446003151,2019-04-30,133594670,Jackie,Amazing location and it cannot get any better! Florin was a great host and easy to get in touch with. Will definitely stay at his place again next time in town!

15699861,315350565,2018-08-28,172055046,Elizabeth,The unit was as shown clean and lots of amenities quiet building. Rolyn was very accomodating responded quickly to my messages and gave clear check in instructions. To no fault of the host I checked in late at night and the neighbourhood was a little 'sketchy' to walk through. It is very close to the subway line so that was convenient and I felt comfortable walking in the area during the daylight. Again this is to no fault of the host just want to provide a safety tip to future renters to be aware at night.
21174440,256374366,2018-04-22,87404803,Bryan,We were in town for 9 days. Perfect spot to stay - close to downtown and north. Kam was fast on his responses and had no issues while there. House was also a great space for a family. Clean and functional too. Thanks!

31517024,495875232,2019-07-26,78251619,Christine,Le logement est sommaire humide froid et mal isolé. Il aurait besoin de travaux de rafraîchissement. Il y a très peu de vaisselle pour la cuisine empêchant de se faire la cuisine. Le logement est près des transports mais reste éloigné des centres touristiques. Le logement est mal isolé phonetiquement nous entendions des pas et des discussions une bonne partie de la nuit venant d'au dessus. Je ne choisirais pas ce logement si Je revenais.
6661292,277084164,2018-06-15,13424606,Sue,We needed a place to stay for a few days and Shannon and Fred's place exceeded all expectations. Wonderful space and hosts!
6276555,242643449,2018-03-12,134876956,Sunyeon,"My parents and I walked in; the place looked terrific considering the price was 73 dollars. 

Over the course of the five days I had booked initially my parents began to express their concern about the amenities that weren't working properly. Notably the WiFi was just not working sometimes and the automatic heating cycle turns off from the hours of 2 am - 6 am. We called the host about the heating since that was the most important issue. The host attempted to increase the temperature of the unit but the heating still turned off during the hours 2 am - 6 am as it was automatic.

We were glad the host was readily available if we needed them they always answered and for the price of 73 dollars it was great. 

My parents had to stay an extra 3 days by this point the price had been increased to 129 dollars per night. With the per night fee increased in combination with the service fee and cleaning fee the price was practically like a hotel. My parents noticed that after we had left and returned the place was not properly cleaned. Due to the price increase I would have just expected to get more out of the place.  The wifi had more issues heating was the same laundry detergent was not available as it was said in the house manual and sound does travel through the walls easy."

36149151,518916756,2019-08-27,121387225,Amy,Very basic but adequate room. If you just need a place to sleep it’s hard to beat this price for the location convenient to hospitals OCAD Ryerson and subway and more. The host was kind and responsive. One downside for me was that there is no lock on the room or bathroom so female travelers may find this uncomfortable to share the space with 2 men.
20591312,468468108,2019-06-12,191048806,Paul,"This was my first time using airbnb. My host responded to all my questions clearly and in a helpful manner. The place is in a great location friendly concierge incredibly clean condo. 

Great first experience on the app and with my host."

Lynne is a perfect hostess she made us feel at home in her house as we arrived hrs before check in.
Her kitchen was stocked olive oil green tea all you need in a home so we had to cook our meals which made our stay enjoyable. She even left youghout and some fruits for us.
This is my first experience in airbnb and it was a great one.
Thanks Lynne for no stress in Toronto"

It's conveniently located and there are plenty of great places to check out around the area. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here the next time I visit. 10/10.
14873227,284956786,2018-07-02,2006226,Cristian,Julie's house felt exactly like a home in Toronto. It's got a great location you can walk to bars restaurants and transportation (both the tram and ride-share bikes are a block away). You're about a 10 minute Uber ride from anywhere else. Julie was really nice and attentive her dog Pip was super cute. She was always available on text she would reply within minutes. Would definitely  recommend it!

36455079,499521369,2019-07-31,89251583,Himanshu,"It was more than just an air bnb room for us. It has been more like a room
In our own house  for us. 

The room is a wonderfully decorated and well maintained cozy room in one of the best locations around the city. More than the room i would love to appreciate the owner Sophia who is more of a friend to us now.

The best welcome that we could have expected for coming to canada was done by her and husband. One of the best hospitality i could ask for after i landed in canada.

The two lovely cats make this place a more lively one. 

I would also want to mention that for us this was not just a random place to live. It was our home away from home. 

The gave us a reassurance of how welcoming the people are in this country.

If you are thinking to book the place my suggestion to you is dun think book it and i am sure you will love the stay."
30256893,415062615,2019-02-21,218853325,Martin,"Une véritable aubaine si vous recherchez une expérience ""de luxe"" à un prix très abordable. Si vous prévoyez cependant cuisiner beaucoup pendant  votre séjour certains articles de cuisine et ustensiles pourraient manquer. Mais pour tout le reste cet appartement comblera parfaitement vos attentes : what you see is what you get (vraiment!)"

You can quickly get to any area of the city. We felt safe there even during evening walks. From the balcony is a wonderful view. The kitchen is well equipped and the apartment very clean. Very good place for a great price. Avika is very friendly and helpful quickly responded to our requests. Very nice smiling and cheerful host !! Very highly recommended !!
22206675,279432693,2018-06-20,129101157,Aurélien,"La chambre était plus agréable que ce que les photos laissaient penser. L'entrée dans les lieux est par contre un peu compliquée : (prendre une ""allée"" a côté de la maison trouver les boîtes/cadenas récupérer les clés ouvrir une première porte une deuxième trouver finalement sa porte de chambre) et se fait seul. 
Sinon la chambre était très propre et agréable : on ne demande rien de plus !"
15080401,312996426,2018-08-24,106860792,Zahra,The room that is being rented is not the one from the picture! Also the air in the unit is quite heavy and humid. Even turning the air conditioning on did not really improve the air quality.
20440144,319524746,2018-09-06,139590292,Manuela,Ewa’s place was great. Very clean and the location is very central and walking distance to the main attractions. Very thoughtful apartment and it had everything and more you needed. Parking was available but you had to pay extra for it.

30981223,559137013,2019-11-03,58526368,Lindsay,Look elsewhere. Nothing nice inviting or comfortable about this place. Communication was null. Inaccurate check-in instructions sent and when asking for assistance there was no reply.  This is clearly only used as a short-term rental. It is not someone's residence. Very few simple amenities (towels toilet paper paper towel soap dishes. ect). Also only 2 bed. Not three beds. Couch does not seem to pull out and even if it did I would not sleep on it.
7292777,462054427,2019-06-01,131517644,Shaneha,Lisa was a great host and her place was sparkling clean! She was very quick to respond to any questions and made sure we had everything that we needed for our stay. She also offered to accommodate us for early check-in and underground parking.

18476496,479029443,2019-06-30,242172572,Prasanna,We stayed in this place for more than 2 months. The unit was quite clean and had all the basic things required to stay comfortably with a family. The storage room inside the unit was very helpful. There is a bus stop right outside the apartment and you can reach the subway station in around 10 minutes. NoFrills is at a walking distance from the unit. There is a Coffee shop and the Coin laundry in the very next building. The convinience store is located in the ground floor of the building.

1174138,243291692,2018-03-15,12124528,Ella,RJ's place was so beautiful. We were really lucky to have stayed there for 7 days. It was a charming 3rd floor flat that we had to ourselves. We had an equipped kitchen (pots pans dishes) to fix ourselves a quick meal. This place was very clean and tastefully designed with a fireplace. The best thing other than RJ was the location! Ossington/Dundas was close to lots of great restaurants and bars. There was no shortage of things to do. We will be back!

6925159,365661143,2019-01-01,228034437,Britt,Douglas has a cool loft. Great transit access. He was always available to answer our questions. Only thing we realized once we got there was that there is no microwave which sucked because we ordered a lot of takeout.

15484242,535074817,2019-09-23,285077574,Caleb,I went to Toronto with no clue where to start looking for hotels or anything. I was referred to airbnb by and friend and Liza’s place was my first. I must say the cleanliness and organization is so good it really made me feel like I was home. For this price also nobody can beat this value. 12/10 recommend I’m definitely going to check Liza’s availability next time I am in Toronto!

11163109,360146188,2018-12-19,117040948,Jazmin,The place was what we needed for exploring The city. I would recommend that this is better for those not commuting via their personal vehicle due to the difficulty with parking around the area. We drove to Toronto and weren’t aware of how hard it would be to follow the random times that you can’t park on certain streets. A ticket for parking on the street is C$150 and then if you don’t happen to get their before they tow it you can add about another C$250-300 depending on how quick you are getting to the lot it’s at. Aside from this and the slow response times with the owner the place is in a perfect location and everything you could need for walking around and enjoying your time in Toronto!
15497982,331404146,2018-10-02,70098691,Alan,We had a great time at Johnny and Alex's place. We didn't see them during the stay but instructions were clear and checkin straight-forward. The location is very good including a large supermarket just across the road. Some lovely views over the city. We would be very happy to stay again if we returned to Toronto.

6635679,184921787,2017-08-20,95256650,Sonja,"Had a really nice stay! The house is well located; while it's a bit far to walk to the city centre (like an hour) it is really close to bus and subway so will only cost you $3.25 and half an hour to get to major Toronto attractions. It is also only about a 20 minute walk to the nearest hop-on-hop-off bus tour stop (which I highly recommend if you're staying in Toronto for a few days!) 
The house itself is fine there are several other guests so it feels a bit like a hostel but more private with a personal touch. Peggy and her mum were friendly and super helpful."
20232083,224180095,2018-01-02,72930269,Adam,Small private apartment. Very clean with a private entrance. The host was extremely good and quick at responding to any inquiries. A little far from downtown but great if you’re looking to stay in the suburbs

We felt he went way beyond the expectation of what we presumed an airbnb was going to be like we suggest if you are traveling to Toronto book a couple of nights with Sean (you will have to book ahead he is very popular) THANKS SEAN XXXX see you in Australia soon OK!
21296216,472926666,2019-06-20,76823390,Kevin,"Kareem's place was amazing. 
Nothing can beat the views and the proximity to everything. It helped a lot that there was parking provided since we drove from the US. Everything was very convenient and instructions were very helpful and accurate. We did have an issue with the washer but it was addressed very quickly. Other than that this was a perfect place and would definitely recommend/stay there again!"

They are always available in person or text to assist in every way they can and as quickly as possible. The place is exactly how you see in the pictures and it has everything you may need. It is very cozy. They care about their guests and there is a binder with maps and tips of the neighborhood (e.g.: restaurant flyers) available in the basement. We loved the location because we could walk everywhere. There are supermarkets laundries drug stores coffee shops parks and much more close-by. We’d definitely stay here again!

10412695,131893114,2017-02-14,40910977,Nathan,The perfect little hideaway downtown.  If your new to the city or a seasoned vet this place is not to be missed.  Situated right across from one of the biggest shrines in the Hockey World this beautiful loft is the perfect getaway for a weekend.  Toronto Subway is only a 1 block walk away making it easy to get anywhere in the city.

19404923,560389392,2019-11-06,127091564,Ene,Fantastic experience!  Sometimes the pictures and write-ups over-state what you get when you walk in the door but this experience if anything was the opposite!  This is a fantastic spacious two bedroom apartment with a really well stocked kitchen and great appliances.    The apartment is in the back of a building on Gerrard which is a somewhat busy street but the unit is so well built and designed that you would never know you are near a busy street.    And thus you get all the benefits of a quiet unit and immediate access to streetcars quick commute to the downtown and great coffee shops / restaurants within minutes from your door.   Highly recommended.

5037911,88665065,2016-07-25,72339108,M,Great apartment in a central location but still located on a quite street. Apartment is on two levels & well equipped. Large balcony at rear upper level that is secluded from street. Closest subway stop was a 6-8min walk. Ideal for a family with slightly older kids.
15743072,510777650,2019-08-16,126284690,Simon,"The positive: Great location and view. Parking included. 
The negative: host was very unresponsive. I Had to complain to Airbnb to get a response from the host.
Apartment Has seen better days. Walls and carpets are dirty. 
Some windows don’t have blinds. 
Washing machine was broken.
Light bulbs missing.
Smoke detector was disconnected and lying in the kitchen.
Windows where dirty from the inside. 
Bed quality was mediocre at best."

1546244,515860089,2019-08-23,103020100,Andreas,Wir haben das 1. Mal über Airbnb eine Unterkunft gebucht und hatten bei Julie die Beste die man sich vorstellen kann. Julie und ihr Mann Hugh vermitteln einem gleich das Gefühl nicht fremd zu sein. Sie geben super Tipps sind kommunikativ und interessiert am Land und Leben des anderen was uns sehr gefiel. Sie sind so gastfreundlichso dass wir während unserer Rundreise mit dem Rad unsere Fahrradboxen bei ihnen lassen konnten Julie organisierte uns zur Rückreise ein Großraumtaxi. Jederzeit würden wir wieder bei ihnen übernachten.
32113035,463600250,2019-06-03,245340668,Armaan,Christelle’s place is perfect if you’re looking for somewhere to stay in downtown Toronto it has a beautiful view and everything you need. It is also very close to the CN tower Rogers place scotia bank arena and many other amazing attractions!

20639617,350091785,2018-11-18,7297528,Peter,"I would definitely recommend this unit. It's a great value for the money. The apartment is spacious and clean. Raymond was very accommodating with regards to the check in and check out times. As far as basement apartments go this is a very bright space (with extremely high ceilings). At times you can hear noises from upstairs (as in any basement) but it wasn't a problem for us. 
The only minor issue is that there were very limited kitchen supplies. So if you plan on cooking/eating in during your stay you might want to get in touch with Raymond to see whether he has addressed that issue in the mean time. 
We had a great stay overall!"
29759508,353129310,2018-11-26,48780763,Sakinna,Great place! Clean cute and close to everything. Would definitely stay again.

37353238,571710032,2019-12-01,182105350,Jessica,We were a group of childhood friends who hadn't seen each other in a long time and The Ossington House was absolutely the perfect place to reconnect!  From the beautiful furnishings and design the artwork the cozy fireplace and blankets the well-stocked kitchen the perfect location near Ossington restaurants and cafes and the extra thoughtful touches including beautiful linen bedding dressing robes specialty soaps and toiletries and even a welcoming bottle of wine - we couldn't have picked the more perfect place.  It was like entering a boutique hotel extremely clean warm and inviting.  Alison was a wonderful host who answered any questions we had and we can't wait to return during future visits to Toronto!

18413333,508254006,2019-08-12,3459392,Georgina,Easy check in and communication. We were surprised to find a sofa bed though looking back at the listing this is stated so is our fault. It wasn’t too comfy but fine for a quick night. Nice to have your own toilet and there was no wait for the main bathroom when we used that. Parking is a little tricky - an unsecured parking lot about 4min walk away but not expensive for the night and we had no issues.
27207445,448716451,2019-05-05,86744525,Dennis,Great apartment with amazing views! Very clean and large enough for our group of 5.

Rana and Nila are great hosts.They are very helpful friendly and prompt in responding to your queries.They were always ready to help us even with the smallest of the needs.Speaking about the house; it is very functional and one need have not worry about any basic amenities as it has everything that you need in day to day life.

5073623,116547830,2016-12-01,105637921,Liam,it was very easy to find with a pretty cool view of the city when you're out front very clean and it's a five minute walk from the Eaton's Centre.
3241344,366380400,2019-01-02,13221765,T. Shane,Charming romantic and well-appointed. This place had everything anyone would need for a comfortable stay. And that hot tub? Perfection.

13174614,216617305,2017-12-04,19637850,Jaime,Great (!) location and parking was a big bonus. A few minor issues (blow dryer didn’t work tub was clogged) that we didn’t bother to mention to the hosts while we were there but that will hopefully be fixed for the next person. Parking was a bit of a hassle when leaving because you have to leave the fob inside but need it to get out of the parking garage. There was no street parking nearby so it involved a lot of extra walking.
11436936,505653998,2019-08-09,93702277,Andrew,Joanne & Carlo’s place was spotless but the best bit was the many many lovely small touches they really didn’t have to do that made it feel special.
23342739,437371905,2019-04-14,26996849,G,Comfortable bed and spacious (Website hidden by Airbnb) was available and responsive and a great host.
23918395,353093532,2018-11-26,203935691,Raphael,Very tidied up place clean and with perfect amenities downstairs (supermarket LCBO). Close to the center of the town subway and parking (paid separately) on the premise. Neat!
22483955,517589760,2019-08-25,127662794,Lauren,Great little studio in the middle of everything! The apartment is cute the neighborhood fun and diverse and the park right outside the door is a wonderful amenity. Darius was super responsive to questions and the apartment was comfortable and spotless. I would definitely stay here again!

8245269,323426532,2018-09-15,62696428,Alexandre,I stayed at Pouneh's place for 7 weeks and everything was great. She always was very kind and helpful answered my questions and messages right away. Her space was quite convenient with perfect location and easy acess to path metro and cable cars. It was equipped with everything needed for a longer stay.
17682585,239188889,2018-02-28,69063074,Amrit,Professionally management. Slow internet only issue. Good location otherwise!!
37854428,518388583,2019-08-26,282610437,Murat,Great host very gentle. A perfect place for couples to stay at with own privacy. Everything in one suite is amazing. Thank you sir! I will definitely come back again :)
27077883,538338381,2019-09-29,67887195,Keegan,Fantastic location if you are looking for something downtown. The accommodations are as described but pretty basic. It does appear to be a business run Airbnb so don’t expect anything special. The unit has great space but the finish aren’t as great. There was obvious damage to the walls and chairs. The residents of the building aren’t friendly to guests so steer clear. Elevators can be a headache but that a building issue out of your control. Overall it’s a good space in prime location.
18615582,293060329,2018-07-19,31104708,Kristah,Tristan was very friendly and helpful. Great location as well. 
9512679,320330211,2018-09-08,9803620,Marga,"The studio of Lori and Ryan is perfect to spend a week or more in Toronto comfortable spacious super clean with a modern and complete kitchen. An unbeatable location outside the chaos of the center but one step away from everything you may need.
We advise all Airbnb guests this study which we plan to return next year for more days.
Thank you Lory and Ryan for having let us stay in your house.
See you soon"
21677102,264261495,2018-05-13,62839173,Sarah,Great time very clean great host and very thoughtful amenities! Thanks Miles and Paul!
16880610,171346280,2017-07-17,117165994,Debbie/John,Location was perfect. View was amazing. The grocery store in the building was a fantastic feature. Top notch accommodations in the heart of downtown Toronto. Would recommend to anyone. 
18912860,505622214,2019-08-09,67110043,Tony,Vincent’s Place was super easy to find well laid out and clean and had the basic comforts you’d come to expect all for a great price and location. Our only comment is the bed was a bit hard so anyone with back problems take note.
17570994,299239062,2018-07-30,19974033,Saki,Great house in a really lovely area! The hosts are highly responsive and the apartment is well furnished. Strongly recommend.

I recommend this place for everybody."
5869076,285410192,2018-07-03,12002019,Jimmy,Perfect apartment perfect hosts perfect location! If you’re coming to Toronto don’t bother staying downtown. Bissa and Milan are great hosts and you’ll have everything you need on your doorstep including excellent restaurants. Only a short streetcar ride anyway from downtown Toronto.
17406344,507464888,2019-08-11,44192995,Rebecca,Had some troubles with cleanliness and access (keys that were supposed to be left in the apartment were not there when I arrived) but when I reported the issues to Kev he was very quick to respond and address the issues. He moved me to another apartment a few floors below the one I booked which was the exact same layout and actually slightly nicer/cleaner. Furniture definitely needs updating and the walls in both apartments I saw desperately need fresh coats of paint but overall the apartment was fine. The best part about the apartment was its location in the heart of the financial district and the amazing view from the balcony.
19490148,234033296,2018-02-11,124258445,Katya,Me and my husband enjoyed our stay at Derek's and Kyleigh's place. The apartment is really nice and cozy it has everything you need. The location is perfect: two-minute walk to the TTC (or 10-minute walk to the subway station with 25-minute ride to downtown) as well as around 20 minutes to the beach. It has separate entrance and electronic lock which is highly convenient. And of course hosts are great they are very friendly and supportive!
14842139,243068012,2018-03-14,163369051,Jerome,Great View I loved my stay
517709,77734322,2016-06-03,52352170,Lynn,Nathalie was extremely helpful from the beginning the house is in a great location (good bakeries and restaurants within walking distance) and it was well stocked with all that you need for a short stay! My sons had a great time at the house too. I highly recommend it.
30768321,547594233,2019-10-15,31738390,Ron,Great location.

6211018,179051564,2017-08-06,55213695,Christie,Bronwyn and Matt were great! They even provided some toys and booms to keep my 2 year old happy during our stay. The location was amazing...a lovely walk through a ravine to the beaches and queen st east. The kitchen was well stocked. All round great stay.
16323704,284421948,2018-07-01,196962084,Jessica,What can I say? My first Air bnb and this was super fun! You didn’t have to but you remembered my birthday and I’ll admit I was freaking out the night before about it. Me and Seb had an amazing time! And I’ve always had the unique ability to gravitate as well attract awesome people. We will see you again soon you’re stuck with us hahaha!
35181518,547137730,2019-10-14,224306945,Alexandra,Karla’s place was very clean and comfortable. A great location with an amazing view of the city. I couldn’t have picked a better place to stay for my first visit to Toronto!
36625914,560718389,2019-11-07,68686140,Devon,Great location very responsive to messages no complaints at all! I will definitely be back!
16884840,495160696,2019-07-25,234786685,Graham,Lovely clean Condo in a great location.
13174614,186447717,2017-08-24,62600820,Felicity,Condo was just as expected! Pictures are exactly as it is! Very clean! Walking distance to a lot of food aquarium CN tower rogers center etc! Walking distance to a grocery store about a block away and the kitchen is stocked with everything that you need to cook anything which is great! I will say that if you are checking in by yourself with a car it could be difficult to pick up and leave your keys and fob but we had two people and it was easy! Easy to find as well! Would stay again great great great host. Also if you go to the building during a busy time you can just follow someone onto the elevator when you first go to pick up the Keys and they will let you up to the 8th floor.
21636593,431281450,2019-03-31,240458159,Lucia,Tobie's place is perfectly located for a trip to Toronto.  Two blocks from public transportation a large grocery store nearby good food choices that are close a conservatory just a couple blocks away and withing walking distance or short public transport of major attractions downtown - including the Path and Dundas square.  The neighborhood felt safe and Tobie's place is great for two people visiting the city.  A big bonus is the all glass wall that lets in natural light and offers a nice view at night that is unobstructed by skyscrapers and other condos.  Tobie was a responsive and friendly host.
6571733,272452443,2018-06-03,151304781,Alexandre,Uma experiência maravilhosa indico para todos que vão para Toronto. O lugar é simplesmente maravilhoso tem tudo na casa para passarem seus dias ou semanas. Bairro silencioso e seguro. Ótimo acesso ao transporte público supermercado e farmácia bem próximo internet tv a cabo cama confortável e tudo oque você poderá precisar. Quanto aos anfitriãos minha gratidão e admiração eles sempre estão buscando fazer o seu melhor. Ganhamos mais um casal de amigos D e Michelle nosso muito obrigado.
6090639,61143395,2016-01-31,56664635,Veronika,It was a very nice place to stay Sue provided everything you can possibly need and more. Very kind and flexible. It felt just like you were at home. I would definately stay here again and would recommend anyone to stay. 10/10 
28511881,467645703,2019-06-10,207087823,Olivia,"Pro: absolutely great location and relatively good place. 
Con: The basement is so dark and uncomfortable. I live almost 4 days and no cleaning during my stay. I understand Chinatown has overall poorer living conditions but tbh my parents are not happy with their staying. :(  If price and location is the only concern to you then it's good to go."
30773459,359324593,2018-12-16,212286339,Briana,Great location. Will definitely book again when coming to Toronto for more events.
1483630,19190222,2014-09-08,11165668,Barbara,I stayed at Janine and John's place for a little over a fortnight in late summer. Their description and pictures of the apartment give an accurate account. The apartment is airy and sunny and aesthetically inspiring. The kitchen had everything I needed for cooking and the study was great for me because I was working. It has a lovely view into the back garden. The bedroom is spacious and beautifully but simply set up. There are indoor plants throughout which I appreciated. It was warm and humid while I was in Toronto - the apartment remained cool. The location is great altho' there's quite a bit of foot traffic down the street and noise till late on Friday and Saturday nights. None of it was unpleasant but I was aware that I was close to a busy cafe/club/entertainment strip. Actually this activity made me feel safe (I was by myself). John was readily contactable and all our communication was easy. Given the opportunity I would stay here again definitely.
16582924,192055264,2017-09-09,2406133,Sarah,Location is 3 blocks from a cool area with bars restaurants shops etc.
18775109,197948681,2017-09-27,38226639,Anas,The place is clean organized with good value for the money. I highly recommend the place.
24232574,276681232,2018-06-14,41108472,Pavel,Amazing view. Clean and comfortable apparent. Walking distance to CN Tower. Right next to water.
13605471,290016653,2018-07-13,96873861,Jonathan,I would like to thank Brett for his great hospitality and his way to take care of us. The privacy we had was just amazing! I was really feeling in vacations at this place. With wooden fences all around I was really feeling I could relax. The tree even acts as a small roof so you never get too much sun and gets you even more privacy. I give it a big 11 out of 10. I could live there all year long.
30814273,435482009,2019-04-10,237708411,Connie,Clean condomimium in a great location across from the convention center and a 5 minute walk from ripley's aquarium and the CN tower.
35863810,508303738,2019-08-12,172722894,Cristian,The place is very well located and looks safe. Comfortable and good place to meet people. Wengsi was very kind and friendly. 100% recommended.
29700152,512542640,2019-08-18,251327366,Johnathan,Ela is very responsive and helpful.
19121965,301161986,2018-08-03,46787822,Angélica,Mi esposo mis dos hijos y yo nos hospedamos veintiocho días en casa de Andrea. Su casa tiene una excelente ubicación en un barrio tranquilo y con un gran parque donde se desarrollan muchas actividades (pudimos presenciar partidos de béisbol y cine al aire libre).  Además está ubicada a unos minutos caminando de la estación Christie del metro.  La casa está limpia y con todo lo necesario. Particularmente la cocina está muy bien equipada. Hay dos supermercados a un par de cuadras y un poco más retirado en el barrio coreano frutas y verduras a precios accesibles. Andrea siempre estuvo atenta y tuvimos una muy buena comunicación. En la casa hay cafetera y Andrea ofrece café a sus huéspedes. Si duda volvería a hospedarme en casa de Andrea y la recomiendo ampliamente. 
6336195,46383975,2015-09-10,37849109,Elliot,"The apt was awesome!!! It was fully furnished with the necessary stuffs. It was also at a very decent location to move around the city. Liz and Art were good host they made my family feel at home. It was a wonderful experience. 
Thanks a lot. "
14490119,403261951,2019-01-20,129295191,Delphine,The room is a bit small but it has everything you need if you are visiting Toronto for a few days. And Maria was very helpful.
7141416,285372187,2018-07-03,108993318,Nisha,Beautiful clean apartment in a great location!
14077682,286576813,2018-07-06,16471760,Vaughn,Perfect spot for some privacy. Super comfortable bed with AC in room. Which was critical during the heat  week of 2018. Thanks again
10393368,273547446,2018-06-06,64183321,Jennifer,Great location very walkable. Comfy bed.  Highly recommend for a couple or single person.
13064101,181943606,2017-08-13,18478800,Alexandre,"There are good and bad things about this place. The good part is that the location is awesome. The check-in procedures are extremely clear and the storage room is super convenient. Ben is really responsive.

When we came in the AC did not work correctly. We called Ben and he immediately found an electrician to fix it. The wifi was not working either but we managed to fix it ourselves (the power bar was not working). We're pretty grateful that the host could fix this almost instantly but I feel like these are two things that should have been caught before we checked in.

Then the bad part. The place has been ""renovated"" but the renovations were poorly done. The toilet is not fixed to the floor correctly and moves every time you sit on it. The light fixture in the main room has been set too low so anyone taller that 5'2"" bumps into it. There is no place to hang wet towels. The furniture is cheap and uncomfortable. The place is in bad shape: scuff marks on the walls floor has not been placed correctly everywhere a bit dirty...

This is not one of these AirBnbs where you stay at the host's place. Ben clearly has a lot of these units and tries to run a kind of hotel business. But despite the price being similar it is not at hotel standards."
14550649,206478944,2017-10-25,119326954,Gill,Love this place.
17547979,470694939,2019-06-16,2850140,Jeff,Amazing location and great communication.

12157556,330401424,2018-09-30,85328558,Angela,"This is a great place to stay regardless of if you have a long layover or are just in the area. 

Our room and common areas were kept very clean and organized. I slept very well since the mattress was very comfortable and even though it was a basement it was never cold. 

Andy was easy to communicate with and fast to respond. The self check-in was very easy and so was finding parking. 

This place is amazing for the price and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again."
25381992,511658629,2019-08-17,194581483,Diana,Did not feel comfortable knowing that we had to keep the fact that it was an Airbnb secret. It made for uncomfortable situations when bringing in our items through the apartment. However the place was VERY clean a lot more spacious than I thought I’d be and it was a great location. Public parking was a bit of a distance but nothing to complain about when you’re so close to things.
6558171,79215318,2016-06-11,16509635,Ali,Elliot was very easy going person and the room was simple and clean. 
29858264,408517719,2019-02-04,202483799,Imathief,just a great place to stay....the rooms were very clean and done up well. Sue was kind. Hurry up and book this one!
25208606,565583308,2019-11-17,55658642,Ryley Robert,Great little place to stay comfortable and simple. Only used the space to sleep but was a great stay.
25892689,471561571,2019-06-17,207883006,Aninda,Very good stay the room is a bit small but that was fine. Super easy check-in and the amenities was good.
37800404,542728548,2019-10-06,16308890,Wayne,I highly recommend this place. Location was perfect house was very nice and clean (true new luxury apt) and my host Charles was very accommodating and flexible.
5521420,546276965,2019-10-13,291627301,Joshua,I am still a bit anxious about the whole Air BnB process so I take great care in selecting the places I stay. Sandy was listed as 5 stars and for a good reason.
21299652,435148545,2019-04-09,2813195,Kirsten,"Great studio apartment stocked with all the necessary amenities. I was in town for a conference at the convention centre. The apartment was close to groceries train station and all that Toronto has to offer. Would stay again if I ever had to return. Nikki was very helpful and responsive check in was easy.

Light sleepers might be bothered by the construction in the building next door (early starts) but this won't last too long."
18893052,339410036,2018-10-21,202069613,Ryan,Place looks just like the photos and was in a great location! Would definitely recommend to others!

Check in was easy Cal was very kind and responded quickly to make sure all our needs were met. The place was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay in Toronto. Will definitely stay again! 
21822791,255466903,2018-04-20,83363525,Andrea,Salí ayer del dto de William  la ubicación es excelente y su hospitalidad también . El departamento es enorme  las camas son muy cómodas  almohadas pocas  la limpieza del departamento es muy buena a excepción de algunos elementos  de la cocina . En el anuncio dice desayuno incluido y solo hay café para tomar . En general todo estuvo muy bien  sin duda volvería !!!
18564432,273897647,2018-06-07,116406453,Rochelle,Joan was a courteous and responsive host. Her place was spotlessly clean comfortable and convenient.

6922238,197452727,2017-09-25,36411804,Pauline,Good place to stay for few days and visit Toronto. The communication was good with Sam !
5825038,189435027,2017-09-01,24111949,Melanie,Wer sehr gut und günstig in Toronto unterkommen möchte  ist bei Ben und Anita bestens aufgehoben. Wir haben viele Informationen erhalten und das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist topp. Das Frühstück war wunderbar und wir können die Unterkunft zu 100 % weiterempfehlen.
14874961,176334906,2017-07-30,30203725,Joey,Check in was seamless. Location was perfect. Unit was exactly as advertised. Support was available almost instantly. Great rental.
6620431,98952972,2016-09-02,60629812,Kai,"If you ever asked yourself why you prefer airbnb instead of a hotel you'll definitely find the answer at Aamers place.
He was a great host and knows what he's doing.
When I arrived he gave me like all information and adresses in which I was interested in. Even if I was exploring the city I still could contact him anytime. My stay felt more like a week at a friends house that I didn't see for a long time. I also was able to leave my suitcase and bag in his apartment until I had to go to the airport in the afternoon.
Aamer is really funny and nice and there's absolutely nothing to complain about. The area is really local and you can reach most of your destinations by foot. So if you have the chance to travel to Toronto  I can highly recommend this place! 
"
17848039,343734518,2018-11-01,52386168,Amandeep,"Monica’s place is fantastic! Well appointed super-central with a view to match. From the balcony you can see the CN Tower (3 min walk) Rogers Stadium (3 min walk) and just across the road the Railway Museum. From the start communication from Monica was prompt and detailed. Based on this the self checkin was absolutely smooth. By Toronto standards the apartment size is good. It’s tastefully decorated and we were delighted to find ample toiletries dishes in the kitchen for a comfortable medium to long stay.

I can’t stress enough how central the place is. So much so that we could walk to all of the places we wanted to visit in Toronto and ended up taking the streetcar only once just for the experience. 

10 stars all around highly recommended and we will be back!"
1604069,485876414,2019-07-11,22112984,Anne,"Lucille’s and Alan’s home is absolutely marvellous: from the setting to the gardens and the immaculate and stylish suite.  We loved our stay and can’t wait to come back.  Thank you Lucille and Alan for the good tips that added extra charm to our stay.  Say hello to the kitties for us!

Anne & Geoff"

16391394,311572619,2018-08-21,186274237,Kaela,The house is cute and cozy when you walk in. A bottle of wine some chocolates and a guest book was waiting for us next to the door as we arrived. Such a nice touch! The bedroom windows allow you to see some foot traffic however by using the wooden blinds you’ll have total privacy. The bed was comfy with more than enough room for two. The kitchen was stocked with some dry goods in the cupboards and condiments were in the fridge. There were towels left for us hair dryer tooth paste basically all the toiletries you probably keep in your own home were all stored in the bathroom. Also the shower head made for a really nice relaxing shower! The host was so detailed with tips and made staying in Toronto a lot more fun with different recommendations and info from someone so familiar with downtown. Great price on this b&b too. Definitely would book again.

 Regina and her husband helps us for the subway information and they were very nice.
The house is beautiful and the street too perfect place for the autumn ! The house is near restaurants and stores so it's pretty easy and convenient. 
I will come again if I have to go near Toronto. "

Yes it's true I have never commited to a host for an air bnb stay. As it was a first time for me to use the service I was surprised at how everything looks 150% exactly like in the photos. The views were amazing the apartment was cozy and I really enjoyed my stay. Jonathan was great at getting back to me if I had any questions or requests. I had a friend stay with me for 2 nights and he decided to drive without tell me he needed parking. As soon as I got to know i contacted Jonathan about parking space and he sent over a guide to his parking spot in the building. It was extremely convenient! Overall this experience couldn't have been better! If I ever go back to Toronto and want to stay in the entertainment district I would gladly stay here again! "

Mini-fridge and microwave just outside the room was very convenient. Bed was very comfortable. My privacy was respected. I recommend this place to everyone. I would definitely stay here again.
28786307,539027394,2019-09-30,2989394,Becky,Amazing location - close to Rogers Scotia Centre Union Station and the Harbourfront. Felt very safe having the security desk in the front. Apartment was clean and comfortable and exactly as expected. Would definitely stay here again!

20125181,225466418,2018-01-06,4650086,Bronwyn,Rick and Ginger were wonderful hosts. Their place was the epitome of a stylish home opening the front door to guests from far and wide. If you're looking for accommodation in the true spirit of AirBNB you don't need to look any further.
20902086,450939742,2019-05-10,12368199,Ralph,The apartment is a beautiful place to stay in downtown Toronto central to many activities food spots etc. Would highly recommend!

543242,22466237,2014-11-07,20786128,Jennifer,Me and my boyfriend liked our stay there. It is also a great neighbourhood. We hadn't much time to talk to Mallory and Brock (because of daytrips and exploring the city) but they seem very open and nice! The room is actually bigger than it looks in the pictures.

23895246,314922953,2018-08-27,50522174,David,"Location location location overlooking Avenue Road.

We never met John (nor Daniel) but he was most responsive to emails.

Check-in and -out at the front desk was seamless better than at most hotels!

The kitchen is surprisingly well equipped including a Nespresso machine with integrated milk frother! John has thoughtfully provided a handful of coffee pods.

The two ""smart"" TVs have apps for Netflix and YouTube but there's no other TV service (ie. no local stations or cable channels). 

The queen bed is of 'modern construction' which is to say it's a basic mattress on slats.  There's no box spring. Some may find it rather soft with insufficient support for a good night's sleep.

As is typical in many contemporary hotels and condos the in-room HVAC unit has a noisy fan. If you're a light sleeper it may disturb your slumber even with the fan set to slow speed. We simply turned it off over night then back on in the morning. An easy fix!"
14837847,439206406,2019-04-18,52437148,Arturas,We stayed for 13 days and were very pleased with the accommodation. The place was homely nice and clean the hosts were very friendly helpful but non-intrusive and we had a really great time in Toronto. Thank you.

28520678,468027504,2019-06-11,85187686,Ryan,The studio was very clean and in a great location. Being so close to the Spadina station proved to be convenient and I was able to get where I needed to be with ease. The pictures describe the studio well the space is quite small and does not have a vanity but was not an issue for my purposes. There was also an iron in the studio that came in handy as well. I had an overall great experience and will look to rebook with Todd the next time I plan to visit Toronto.

Stefan and Disa provided very helpful and clear instructions before we arrived. The suite itself is immaculate and cosy it felt like a home away from home. I really recommend staying here. The BeeHaus is now our go-to place to stay when we’re in the city.

I've died the service so I can't say much I suppose but Maja was very helpful and accomodating. She even included a complimentary bottle of wine!!"
21405992,295936626,2018-07-24,150565955,Hannah,"Das Appartement war wie beschrieben: sauber und privat. Es hat uns sehr gut gefallen! Lediglich ein Fenster zum Lüften hat gefehlt. 
Die Küche war klein aber vollkommen ausreichend. Alles was das Herz begehrt war vorhanden. 
Auch die Gegend war sehr schön. Die Bahn bzw zunächst den Bus konnte man innerhalb von 4 Minuten zu Fuß erreichen was sehr gut war. 

Wir hatten zwischendurch kleinere Probleme (bspw. Stromausfall in der Küche) welche direkt gelöst worden sind. Innerhalb von kürzester Zeit nachdem wir den beiden geschrieben hatten kam einer um das Problem zu lösen. 
Alles in allem ein wunderschöner Rückzugsort nach langen Erkundungstouren durch Toronto!"

Fantastic location right in between the Scotiabank arena CN Tower and the harbourfront.  Would recommend.  Don't let the grumpy security guard deter . . .

5805424,179070338,2017-08-06,16954073,Brianna,The apartment looks just like the pictures! Very open and spacious beautiful bathroom. The loft bed has a low ceiling so if you're tall it's best to sleep in the bedroom. Check in and check out was seamless also. The apt was in walking distance to many restaurants and shops. Very central location and it was such a quaint neighborhood! I would definitely stay here again.

Great location and readily accessed by public transit. There is an unbelievable variety of restaurant options close by. I highly recommend Cafe Polonez for a Polish food option. Everything you need for a great stay is provided in including wifi local information and board games.
9812200,109879051,2016-10-23,9502045,Chad,I had a great stay at Glaucia's house. Super friendly and helpful. Great location. There are a few things that could be fixed in the house - but at the price it's still a great deal. Thanks again! :)

She has notes about everything from fresh linens to the best places to eat and shop nearby. Her home is a peaceful welcoming space and very comfortable. It is convenient to shopping walking and some of the nicest places in Toronto.

Kris was very responsive to any questions responding within the hour and gave information on places to visit and things to do whilst in Toronto which was very helpful. I think we got through almost all of them in the week we were here. 
We had a fantastic week in Toronto we would highly recommend a stay in this apartment if you are visiting this lovely city.

27724639,429609778,2019-03-28,68140963,Will,Excellent stay at a perfect location.  The apartment building was pretty much brand new and the room was very clean and orderly.  The bathroom just down the hall was also very clean.  The kitchen/living room was open to me but I was mostly out of the house anyway.  Most importantly the apartment is right off of Bloor/Yonge at the intersection of the two major subway lines so getting around the city could not have been easier.  It's just north of the major downtown area but far enough north to be close to many of the other attractions like the ROM.  Ben was very quick to communicate and was very accomodating.  Very pleased with this stay overall.

27083688,459457369,2019-05-27,2142083,Konstantin,Cozy clean spacious and well-maintained apartment in a triplex townhouse that had everything me and my coworker needed. Zuzana is a great host who gave us hints on Toronto dining and even electronic scene on day 1 of our stay. The area is very quiet yet many amenities and entertainment are around the corner and downtown is a short Uber ride.
37973262,529311829,2019-09-14,9290062,Ivan,This place was fantastic and definitely exceeded our expectations. Don’t pay any attention to some of the old reviews - they were either lying or the place has been renovated completely because it was really nice inside and everything was clean. Paul was super friendly and accommodating and was quick and helpful responding to messages. Check in was very smooth it was self check-in with a code.  Thanks would definitely book again!
17702093,156124997,2017-05-29,68252187,Alesa,This suite is amazing - perfect for a couple visiting Toronto. The location is just far enough from downtown but within walking distance to bayview avenue which has several trendy restaurants and bars worth visiting. The suite itself is so clean cozy and well decorated. It's obvious Lauren put a lot of effort into making this space welcoming and homey. We didn't want to leave! She's also quick with response and a joy all around. Thanks Lauren! 
5758430,99394762,2016-09-04,54625523,Megan,My sister and I had a fantastic visit from start to finish. There were snacks for us when we arrived which after travelling was a very welcome treat. The condo was beautiful and looked exactly like the pictures. We loved every minute of our stay and hope to rebook again next year! Thank you so much for for a wonderful experience! 
20934304,292708555,2018-07-18,87776903,Max,Wonderful little place to stay while exploring the city. Be sure to make use of the host’s excellent recommendations.
14384510,341327507,2018-10-26,44124493,Xuntao,This is my second time in Patrick’s place in two months. I chose it again for its great location and great amenities. However there are a few things I wish to address this time. The duvet cover smells like bad feet when I used it the first night. The hosts did not respond to this issue after I pointed out to them. I had to wash it my self the another day. Also the heat was not turned on in the first night I woke up in the cold. And had to figure out how to turn it on myself. (You gotta press the “system” button on the controller.) I think they should either address it or they should turn on the heat for us before we come. Other stuff are great!
14282377,354863722,2018-12-02,225035812,Alberto,I had a great staying at Summer’s place the place is totally private. Summer’s husband was very kind to receive me at the time of check in and open the doors for me as it was dark and made my check in easier.
6730812,327161116,2018-09-23,18285190,Trisha,Lucy's place is a comfortable clean home in a great location for exploring downtown Toronto.  It's near Kensington Market Queen St West Chinatown.  Lots of great food options nearby.  The unit is very quiet despite being close to major streets downtown.  Lucy's place is well-equipped for a comfortable stay.  Extra nice touches included healthy breakfast items tea coffee.   We enjoyed our weekend here very much!  Thanks Lucy!

12065680,239421111,2018-03-01,45974906,Alicia,Wonderful hosts! Very welcoming and accommodating we felt totally at home! For my partner and I it was the perfect amount of interaction we had our privacy and didn't feel like we were intruding on theirs but also they were available to offer food/entertainment recommendations and answer any questions we had. Their apartment is so stylish and artsy and the room was spacious bright and impeccably clean. They even were so thoughtful as to have a space in the bathroom for our toiletries a space in the shower to use and even a towel rack space just for us. Also the neighborhood is excellent a short 5 minute walk to Portuguese bakeries and within walking distance to Kensington market and Queen Street West. It was a short stay this time but I would not hesitate to book again!
19497395,435130692,2019-04-09,29896941,Bryan,Yani's unit is as advertised! The view is incredible it's super close to the water and the Convention Center and he was so quick and detailed with communications before during and after my stay. Can't recommend Yani and this unit enough if you want to get a taste of the skyline of downtown Toronto! I'd stay there again for sure!

The location was excellent - lots of interesting shops cafes and restaurants and only a short street car trip to downtown Toronto.
Highly recommend the accommodation.
Thank you so much to our wonderful hosts.

There are bars cafes restaurants and a comedy parlour all within walking distance. The appartment is sizeable and is self contained. The host was responsive and very helpful. The one downside was the “second bed” which is a fold out couch in a very bright room with no linen or bed pillows.
1856109,339576319,2018-10-21,131359584,Jillian,We loved the location and how clean everything was!
27258565,535002535,2019-09-23,290198272,Catherine,Great and very convenient place to stay.
20803625,423296173,2019-03-13,77005830,Michael,Good condo wunice view and close to Union station. Would recommend to anyone staying in Toronto.
18557039,318797394,2018-09-04,173261783,Alexander,"The place was quite good in terms of cleanliness and location. The host was kind and the location is decent. It is by the water which is nice.

Lack of utensils like cups if you want a cup of tea or coffee we only found 1 available for use. Parking in the area is very scarce and its quite a walk to the downtown core."
2329180,288760703,2018-07-10,59439649,Karyn,Frank and Bryce have been very lovely hosts. The accommodation was very clean and looked exactly how it was posted. My husband and I appreciate him offering us coffee in the morning.  Frank knows how to give his guests privacy and is willing to share advices/experiences about the city and everything else.  Totally worth every penny.
6424590,33212595,2015-05-25,18382940,Megan,The condo full of light very clean (and brand new!) with an amazing view of Toronto skyline. Val very thoughtfully left fresh flowers bread fruit and juice for our arrival. Natta and Val were very helpful and timely in their responses offering neighborhood suggestions and transit options around the city. They are laid back and were accommodating to us and our two young children. Their place is very bike-able to waterfront and downtown walkable to many restaurants. We used our own bikes but there's a bike share directly across the street. Public parking garage on the other side of the block on Richmond St.

8150048,86824136,2016-07-17,80668046,Danie,Alex was friendly and responded promptly to all communications.  The view from the living area is stunning.  For the purpose of my stay location was very important and and the apartment was perfectly situated.  However the general cleanliness of the apartment is not up to standard.  For the price I was paying I expected at least clean sheets a clean bathroom and a general clean apartment.
32083869,465373932,2019-06-07,216125805,Noah,Decent place for the price parking is a hassle and cost 4$ a day(can only be paid with toonies)
17916057,287747332,2018-07-08,90714249,Ben,Great private room extremely flexible check in time very good communicator

my questions. His place is very clean and  cozy. Enjoyed it very much."
19287867,349476822,2018-11-17,23967216,Aidan,Great location & fast communication but a few issues to resolve e.g. cleaning & rooms advertised.
7126527,414696504,2019-02-20,99464141,Michael,Such a great cozy place in a lively area. Patrick was very accommodating and quick to help if we needed anything. Would recommend to everyone!
5608011,81626713,2016-06-24,71553687,Keshav,We had a great experience at the apartment. The location was perfect for walking around the city. We had an easy time getting in contact with Bryden but we had no problems with the place. Also the view from the rooftop was amazing!

32185102,532860675,2019-09-20,276097395,Paul,We stayed here for 2 nights before our flight home. It is only 15mins away in an uber which was handy. The basement accommodation was lovely. Really modern clean and stylish. The communication from the hosts were swift and answered all our queries. The hosts even let us check out at a later time as I explained we had a late flight that day. The bed was really comfy the shower was great the bar area and nespresso machine were great amenities. This Airbnb ticked all the boxes. Thanks for having us.
19825694,293075214,2018-07-19,145440987,Tao,The best Airbnb house that I have ever seen and booked !! .... which leads me to the fact that the Canadian airbnb is always much better than American ones ...
27084537,503112010,2019-08-05,178882258,Reana,It was a clean & nice place. You just can’t keep noise because of tenants downstairs

7272408,120187777,2016-12-08,1238612,Liz,We loved every minute of our time here. Mike and Karen were very congenial and helpful. The apartment was comfortable and well equipped...and ideally like located for us close to both High Park and the great stores and eclectic cafés in the Junction neighborhood. 
36724775,564732707,2019-11-16,280955049,Lena,Quick responses and very easy to fix that we could be there one day longer. Very detailed instructions and easy to find. Also a very safe neighborhood.

3476587,76147161,2016-05-25,9251789,Adam,We had a very nice stay at the place. It is exactly as described and has all the stuff you need for your stay. It really is a very liveable place. Location is great and there is a great coffee place opposite the unit.  Adam and his partner were very responsive and helped/guided us throughout our stay. Beautiful experience overall highly recommended!
17682332,247769808,2018-03-29,173687867,Adelola B.,I stayed here with my friend for a girls trip and it was absolutely phenomenal. The location is perfect to access all of Toronto’s trendy neighborhoods. We were able to get in and out easily and the home is exactly as pictured. And with other guests in the home. We never ran into anyone once! Will definitely come back again.
28388149,343134913,2018-10-30,212502377,Joanna,I took a chance on renting a place which didn't have a review yet but I didn't get disappointed.  (I also checked that Raya's reviews of the other properties were all very good.  Julie who was my host was very responsive and always returned my enquiries promptly.  The apartment is just as described online the wifi connection worked well and the place is in a quiet neighbourhood but close to stores and transportation.  All in all a very positive experience.  Thanks Julie and Raya.
13714921,331002927,2018-10-01,7370641,Malgorzata,The place is spacious and looks as in the photos. It was clean and equipped with soaps shampoo hair dryer and even an iron. I thought I would feel cold but there was an additional blanket that kept me warm in the night. Overall my experience was great and I’ll definitely come back if I go to Toronto again.
12602468,154175708,2017-05-23,112901883,Brian,Debbie's place was great. The description and photos are exactly what you get when you arrive. Check in and out went very smoothly. Would definitely stay again!
24309162,479038399,2019-06-30,195817600,Brian,This place is awesome with an amazing view of the CN Tower right across the street. It doesn’t get more central than this and you are walking distance from almost everything. The host was great and communicated ahead of my arrival and after i left so there were no surprises. I would definitely recommend it.
22387859,303098396,2018-08-06,141126218,Chanel,Thomas is an amazing host his home is super clean and has everything you need. He went above and beyond to make sure the other guests and my self had everything even bring us extra food and water. I would definitely recommend a stay with Thomas.

27838098,501453400,2019-08-03,2999513,Karen,My third stay here in as many months! Outstanding hostess great location feels like a home away from home!
21325134,513565602,2019-08-19,201444093,Ni,Absolutely adored this unit . So stylish and nice so sad it was only a night will definitely be back if I get the chance . I wish parking could’ve been underground but it’s downtown I expected it . Loved the balcony and the kitchen was beautiful
14808200,200801570,2017-10-06,2507071,Shalon,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was better than expected. Robyn was a great host who communicated well. She communicated often and with thorough directions. She allowed us to check in super early which was a major plus. There were a couple of minor hiccups (broken bed- her husband fixed it immediately & the potential for no water for one day - the service was cancelled so we had water after all). She was quick with any updates and super flexible. The apartment was perfect in location cleanliness and with transportation options. I would definitely stay again and recommend Robyn to anyone looking for a place to stay in Toronto.
18214988,451367362,2019-05-11,9739589,Matt,Really great place amazing views and location. Would 100% stay here again.

27705416,320975857,2018-09-09,209182528,Lyndon,Excellent accommodation would stay again anytime!
7132329,102173438,2016-09-17,87340219,George Stanley,The listing was very accurate. The place was even more beautiful than pictures. Great area with spots to eat around and close to Subway. Only took us a 5 min-10 min walk to subway station then 2 min subway ride to get to eaton center
32461753,460594175,2019-05-29,18249896,Dale,The listing was just as advertised. I would stay there again.
13532029,515264446,2019-08-22,26846776,Shaine,Loved the stay at Vivian and Wei’s apartment. The location was great and the view was fantastic. The apartment is slightly small but is comfortable for 2 persons.
17855818,347522263,2018-11-11,53183936,Isabela,A casa do Nick é bem leal às fotos bem localizada próxima à uma estação de metro. Estacionamento no local é uma dificuldade pois na rua é proibido e não tem estacionamento próximo. A cama é um pouco apertada para um casal não é tamanho queen.
21528654,283789370,2018-06-30,168157472,Daniel,I booked this place for my parents who visited for two weeks in June/July. They were very happy and would stay again. Lara was extremely attentive and dealt with one or two minor niggles very quickly and thoroughly. The location is excellent and the space is very good - my parents especially appreciated the large walk-in closet.
4951472,81508646,2016-06-23,27400929,Tricia,"Karen greeted me showed me around the house and made me feel welcome. Explained anything that needed explaining and left me to settle in. The basement floor was exactly as described it was a very comfortable stay for me and had I all needed for my 2 weeks holiday. On the second week I found waking up in the basement without natural sunlight quite draining but that's just a personal thing about light that Dale could not change.
The neighbourhood does have quite a few homeless people hanging around which I found a little daunting at times but they seem very harmless once I got used to them being there.
Dale and Karen were great hosts that were there if one needed and gave plenty of space to oneself also."
31243250,548056708,2019-10-16,297999454,Matthew,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14612719,271888389,2018-06-02,17519474,Trishan,"Mike is a great guy! Place pretty accurate from what's described easier way to his place especially with luggage? A bus after the subway. Take the subway line 1 getting off at St. Clair station (one station before Davisville) then taking bus 74 (follow the signs to where the buses go) 

FYI be sure to take a transit pass just in case of anything? Or a POP (proof of purchase) as they call it from the subway (small box like machines) to show the bus driver so you can get on and continue with that one fare you paid to your destination.

 then down at Mt Pleasant Avenue Corner Merton Street. His place is about 100 meters from that corner. :)"
36074702,522123727,2019-09-01,274505299,Jacob,Marie's place was wonderful. Her mother Irene was a great help to us. The place feels like home and it was sparkling clean. They have a really really cute dog Milo. The place is well connected by public transport we wish we could stay there even more.
28436712,342330730,2018-10-28,90727571,Brooklynne,Beautiful spacious home. Tons of beds and seating areas. Very clean and lots of parking. Definitely recommend this place for an enjoyable stay.

32881181,458116902,2019-05-25,258616369,Karen,"Frankie responded very fast. I once had an issue with the key and he did not hesitate to come back the next day to show me again how it works. 
It was a pleasant stay!"
9495542,169209983,2017-07-11,130023024,Richard,Feela is very helpful and friendly. Very neat place ...Feela provides breakfast and makes staying at his place very enjoyable..His place is second to non .
13876367,531868418,2019-09-18,10259282,Ken,Great place. The room is larger than the photos convey. It’s very comfortable and has everything you need. The location can’t be beat—lovely tree-lined street short walk to the subway a coffee shop nearby. Ruth is very quick to respond to questions.
21220127,262346701,2018-05-08,27924776,Juho,What a nice place
9139993,109119433,2016-10-19,97844799,Genesis,My friend and I stayed at this Airbnb listing for a total of two days. Overall we had a great experience. The location worked out really well - it was near chinatown and there were many shops and cafes etc. within walking distance. The place itself was clean. And Jonathan did a great job of getting back to us in a timely manner.
16269712,135593362,2017-03-05,115925705,Katelyn,Calvin's place was perfect for my husband and I's short stay in Toronto. Liberty village is perfect with everything you'd need within walking distance. The condo was clean and bright with enough room for 2. :)
6044426,113009043,2016-11-09,61287079,Roman,Lily war sehr zuvorkommend und hat alles gemacht dass ich einen angenehmen Aufenthalt hatte. Sie ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend und die Unterkunft ist toll gelegen hat eine umwerfende Aussicht und hat alles was man braucht. Ich würde jederzeit wieder da übernachten. Lily hatte sogar für einen Parkplatz gesorgt was in dieser Gegend nicht selbstverständlich ist.
6185463,146385374,2017-04-22,76631162,Rosanne,"Brian and Rene are perfect hosts: genuine friendly and respectful.  They answered questions very quickly and clearly and check-in/out was completely painless!  

The space is exactly as described.  The garden and pond surrounding the carriage house has a private entrance and all the modern conveniences.  It really is very beautiful space. The location in Riverdale is perfect and there are plenty of options to dine out get take-away or go for a cup of coffee.  I loved wondering the neighbourhood with my pup taking in all the different architecture and cultures.  It was very easy to rate 5 stars in every category!"
35846039,539006456,2019-09-30,161357642,Michael,Great place with a great host!
20451443,202503716,2017-10-11,48435928,Mickael,"Yonglei's place is very clean close to downtown.
The flat is shared with only 3 other guests which is quite comfortable.
Easy check-in/check-out."
33393570,522678279,2019-09-02,97439134,Helen,This is a nice location in a historic neighbourhood of Toronto convenient to many local restaurants grocery and other amenities. We had a lovely walk in a local park and easy transit to see a Blue Jays game and attend the CNE. The apartment is very clean modern and beautifully appointed. It would be a pleasure to stay there again.
15204934,234933086,2018-02-14,129985270,Shiv,I had the opportunity to stay here for a month during which my family joined me for a couple of weeks. We had an amazing time staying at this clean safe and centrally located accommodation. Grace is an outstanding host who took care of all our needs and went beyond to make sure my family is comfortable during our stay. She is an amazing cook and her carrot cake can easily get her some accolades. She is extremely kind and I even got the opportunity to meet her amazing family and friends during our New Year dinner. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a home away from home. 5/5 from me!
2785516,12031724,2014-04-21,5477989,Alicia,We are so glad we found this gem of a suite. We came to Toronto looking for someplace central clean affordable and unpretentious. This has a cozy hideaway feel while being open and uncluttered - plenty of space to spread out and make yourself at home. New comfy bed and futon couch makes even a family stay doable. Our two kids loved sliding on the new laminate floors and practicing their dance moves in the floor-to-ceiling mirrors! Spotless fridge/stove in a spacious kitchen with basic equipment. Separate entrance and free laundry. Strong WiFi. Zero musty-basement feel. Very comfortable (I imagine especially so in a Toronto summer). Plus a private garage for your car (an asset with Toronto's parking rules)! Nice location and even nicer hosts! We'll be back!
14980600,300156223,2018-08-01,87393931,Jill,David and Negar are very quiet and pleasant hosts and helpful if you need directions or suggestions of where to go in the area. The bedroom is basic with twin beds and a fan and the adjacent washroom is clean and spacious. The accommodations are on the second floor and share the same hallway as the hosts' master bedroom.  The location is a tad confusing to find due to construction in the area. Spadina ends at Eglington you turn right on Eglington and due to construction the reconnection to Spadina is closed  and you will have to detour around a few streets. The home is on a quiet treelined street facing a park.  If you are using your stay as an inexpensive place to sleep in an upscale neighbourhood then it is perfect!
8237869,112152153,2016-11-04,101507384,Jayne,"Phil's place was an absolute pleasure to stay at !! It was the perfect distance from downtown and was beyond comfortable. I'll be coming back here for sure ! 
It truly felt like a home away from home."
23960258,277139377,2018-06-15,7554380,Matteo,You know the feeling of being home but in the morning you realize that you are far from home? let me tell you the only thing that is going to remind you are actually away is the laggage cause everythingelse is like home or better... Sameena will give you the best advices about Toronto to make you enjoy it the most! Look forward to go back there!!
6774973,210874812,2017-11-11,151502730,Greg,Great home! Great location for us! Couldn’t have been a better experience
34251650,510817247,2019-08-16,626753,Randy,First off the location was great. It was 1 block from where we needed to be so it was a big selling factor. Unfortunately that's where it ended. A bunch of problems. Shower in 2nd bathroom was broken. Garbage was not emptied completely before arrival. Check-in required us to wait at the front door for another tenant to open it. Host should have met (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was fine but clearly a hands-off host. Only 1 key for apartment building and unit (difficult with 3 people). NO BLINDS IN THE APARTMENT.
19681545,453015256,2019-05-14,239298169,Christine,Simple and uncomplicated checkin.  Very well furnished clean apartment.  Nothing was missing.  Very recommendable.

6603099,464801352,2019-06-06,46754941,Roy,Shirin was very accommodating and is an excellent host! She’s very friendly and takes a sincere interest in the people she hosts. The room is simple and small but clean as was the bathroom. The location is only a short distance from the heart of the city and about a 20 min walk to Union Station. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend staying with her. She’s wonderful!

Its location near shops restaurants the Kensington Market and several pubs is only the beginning.  The Loft is beautiful as the photos suggest with everything you could possibly need and is full of interesting art and books and quirky items not unlike the shops nearby.

28336592,405751492,2019-01-27,236192570,Roland,A pretty nice place. In terms of location there’s things around but it’s a ways away from other parts of downtown like shopping areas and Chinatown Little Italy etc. which are big areas for food. Still accessible through short uber rides or the subway. Only three complaints. One is that there was only one bottle of shampoo for one of two bathrooms and we were a party of 5. The other things are that there was no tv remote and aside from that there was 0 communication before and during the stay when we tried to contact the host. Other than that it’s a great place to stay.
21949631,322229599,2018-09-12,188878142,Jan,"Wir waren für eine Woche bei Julie und unsere Erwartungen wurden mehr als erfüllt. Es war sehr sauber und Julie sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Man hätte sich bei Fragen jederzeit an sie wenden können. Außerdem haben uns der unkomplizierte Check-In und -Out gefallen da man nicht ständig nach einem Schlüssel gucken musste und unabhängig von Julies Anwesenheit war.
Wir würden diese Unterkunft zu jederzeit wieder buchen."

As mentioned in some reviews you have little privacy. The bed is just next to the kitchen and the host family cook and eat dinner right in front of the bed at 9 pm. They pass by me when I try to sleep. If you are looking for a comfortable place to sleep you should choose somewhere else."

The room was cozy and warm comfort. Bathroom was also fine.

2578190,47419496,2015-09-18,23169951,Benjamin,The place was absolutely perfect. Small but had everything we needed. Great location close to Liberty village and really anything needed. It was a pleasure to be able to have a comfy place to crash and hang out at. I would recommend it to anyone.

She answers questions very fast and she even got us a new kettle. I had a great time. Will definitely come back again.
22728944,524750335,2019-09-06,58861267,Donia,"Thank you very much for receiving us. 
I just want to make you know that the bathroom is not that clean there were lot of bad smell. 
One of our towels was stained with javel. 
And we didn’t appreciate to be filmed by the camera in the kitchen. It was positioned towards the bathroom so it’s not appropriate. 
And almost each night  the light was turned on in the corridor. 
A last thing : for our last morning the lady who lives downstairs of the basement knocked very loudly on the door like she was irritated. It was about our car which was parked behind hers but it’s not an appropriate behaviour with host. Above all we didn’t know that a car was parked inside of the garage because all others car were parked outside of the garage."
24833505,412463492,2019-02-15,234741918,Seyed Kamyar,Very clean great location nice and lovely host. I advise you to experience this place and enjoy it. Thanks Dom and Jenna. I will comeback soon.
32616575,453027636,2019-05-14,92290657,Simon,"Location was great close to restaurants shops and a cinema. Appartment was very bright! Easy commute to all areas of interest in Toronto using the metro. 

A few caveats: the appartment wasn't very clean the bed was a bit soft and there were no curtains in the living room which isn't ideal for anyone sleeping in the sofa bed."
20590984,359662363,2018-12-17,23865952,Liza,Great place  with perfect location!!
6831843,266223868,2018-05-19,182450388,Abigail,Shanny's place was easy to find - a great place to stay if you are planning to visit York University's campus. The house was pretty clean and the WiFi was excellent. I have mostly positive remarks about Shanny's place. The only negative things I have to say are that the bed was slightly uncomfortable and the bathroom was a bit dingy. Other than that it was an excellent place to stay.
19121165,270859929,2018-05-30,57406912,Valerya,Wonderful stay at a chic little basement spot. Grab your own little piece of Toronto village life in Greektown away from the downtown riff raff. Pro tip: jog from the bnb along the waterfront for sick views bro!

21028321,466636212,2019-06-09,253278556,Emma,Would recommend this house/area to anyone looking for a weekend get away in Toronto!! This space was perfect and very affordable for my boyfriend and I and offered everything we could need. Loved how it felt like we were in our own space. Walking distance from so many good restaurants and the water. Only negative was the vent that was lower than the ceiling in certain areas (my bf is over six foot and had to duck a few times).
18009897,566754391,2019-11-20,181263673,Kirill,A good place to stay in!

6838049,295485327,2018-07-23,22249485,Renata,"The location of the house is perfect you can walk to almost all city attractions or take public transportation. There are also many restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk. The house itself has two floors and several rooms (only two rooms share the bathroom). Everything is sparkling clean and very homely. There is also a patio area where you can mingle with other house guests. 
Overall this was a great and very welcoming experience!"
16564739,126386498,2017-01-11,52574649,Annalisa,"This was a great place! 
The location is absolutely perfect walking distance to fantastic restaurants and entertainment. I loved that the unit itself is not located on the busy street but in a quiet courtyard with stunning views of the CN tower. The unit itself has a perfect layout very clean and well equipped with everything one may need.  The bed was so comfortable I melted in it! 
Highly recommended I will definitely return. 
Thanks Madeline.

16560977,151211209,2017-05-11,85610338,Samantha,We arrived much later than expected. Charles was awesome with communication and stayed up to ring us in. The apartment had everything we needed and the balcony was awesome.  We were glad we could find places in walking distance for some great late night food and drinks after a day of travel. 
15115210,279739102,2018-06-21,182007785,Chika,Great!
35864791,551736789,2019-10-20,22091561,Romain,The apartment is ideal extremely well furnished and totally independent of the rest of the house. It has all the necessary comfort for a short or very long stay. The bedding is superb the household equipment is all included and the apartment is located near several tram and bus stops. Nothing to complain about!
23589691,246920495,2018-03-26,107405029,Billy,I would recommend Meri’s place to stay for sure!!  It’s small but clean and everything you need.  Supper Market across the street and is in the perfect location if you want to watch a HockeyBasketball or Baseball game.   We will be back!!
26525647,483787873,2019-07-07,153431613,Adam,Perfect location across street from waterfront stadiums & big attractions. Great apartment w/full kitchen & view (plus indoor pool). Definitely recommend staying here while visiting Toronto (short drive to Niagara).
15664293,234041928,2018-02-11,107075685,Taylor,Highly recommend!! The place is so beautiful and so clean! Perfect location and so so affordable! Don’t miss out!
23110484,298604700,2018-07-29,86904218,Luis,The place was very clean and modern and also very close to the CN Tower I would say less than 5 minutes walking elevators from the parking floor were also great overall it was an excellent and pleasant experience!
17155553,540007204,2019-10-02,249265859,Lucilene,Privacidade  local próximo ao metrô. Anfitrião bem simpático  deixou bem a vontade.
14873923,104445281,2016-09-26,86973865,Adam,Great space great neighborhood and great hosts. The little extra touches made my stay comfortable and home like. Jennifer is very generous and thoughtful. I highly recommend this place and hope to stay here again next time I'm in Toronto. 
24167253,500144755,2019-08-01,5404404,Bruce,Great location and space. Much of the building had AirBnBs so the staff is accustomed to questions from guests.
27100818,331451247,2018-10-02,211993791,Xavi,The host canceled this reservation 320 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

3942993,206054631,2017-10-23,10827206,Kristoffer,"The apartment is just what the listing says so it met my expectations. Yes there were some noise from the bar on the ground floor and also the pipe other reviewers have mentioned. If you know about the noise then you’ll be ok with it. In a building from the 1870’s you have to expect there to be noise from one tenant to the next. The view out to the square and with the CN Tower in the background reminds you which city you’re in for sure. 

The area is super for getting around anywhere in the city with Union Station within walking distance as well as loads of the neighbourhoods downtown. Ideal as a base for visiting the city. There are also great places for breakfast and other meals in the immediate area if you do not want to use the well-stocked and spacious kitchen for cooking."

13769120,456449750,2019-05-21,61556588,Anjelika,My stay at Karen’s place was nothing short of perfect. The apartment is centrally located with public transportation and lots of eateries within walking distance. The space itself is super comfortable and more than enough for two people I’d say the pictures don’t do it justice. Karen and her partner were so sweet and accommodating they let me and my mom check in early helped us with our heavy luggage gave us tips on things to do around the city and even lent us a sweater when they noticed we were a bit underdressed for the weather. Overall it was a lovely experience and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.
1570675,122649490,2016-12-24,41960709,Fionna,Excellent place and lovely hosts. Super accommodating for check ins and outs. Place was very quiet and clean. Very quick to respond to any concerns as well.

Well appointed and well-located. The bed is super comfortable and the place is remarkably quiet for being in the heart of Queen West. Water pressure and shower head height are excellent (my travel partner is six foot four - this matters!). Ben has all the basics covered and if there is something missing you have Winners Loblaws and Shoppers right down the street. "

14389097,151562987,2017-05-13,24738051,Vilberto,The apartment is very well located and comfortable 50 meters from the corner of College street with Bathurst street with streetcar 506 across College street and the 511 streetcar crossing Dundas and Yong Street and 3 or 4 blocks from the Spadina subway station or Bathurst. TheApartment  is located close to ShopDrugMart Supermarkets Restaurants Chinatown and Kensington Market.

21383495,442471399,2019-04-23,23907168,Jovana,Susan and Gary’s place is great! It’s in an awesome location (close to the park and Bellwood’s brewery) and has all you need. They even provided a space heater since it is a basement apartment. Would recommend :)

1299374,46900652,2015-09-14,7572681,Alan,Jude was charming and generous sharing her dinner with us the evening we arrived after an unexpectedly long and tiring trip. We had chosen her place especially for its location which made visiting family members using public transit quite easy. (Jude told us about a short cut to the nearest streetcar line) but we also enjoyed the comfortably furnished apartment. It is essentially one long room for living cooking and eating with a separate bedroom in a half basement but with adequate natural light.  The quiet old established neighbourhood with its mature trees and traditional though renovated architecture provided a pleasant setting. Queen Street East with a range of shops and restaurants was roughly 15 minutes on foot away down a slight hill and with Lake Ontario the boardwalk for strolling swimmable beaches attractive parks and villas another five minutes or so further.  A bus on nearby Woodbine Ave also connected in one direction with Queen Street and in .the other with the east-west subway line The downtown core could also be reached by streetcar in 20-25 minutes and in less time another stretch of Queen Street with another batch of restaurants and boutiques. All in all an ideal place to explore the city and relax afterwards (especially if the weather is good and you can use the outside sitting area and garden at the rear)
20956862,324154211,2018-09-16,215001812,Stéphanie,We really enjoyed our 2 nights stay would go back anytime! About 10-15 minutes of taxi to go downtown but college street is really full of shops coffee shops bars restaurants etc.

25520355,437304387,2019-04-14,41062862,Adrian,Lovely place to stay in Downtown Toronto next to all relevant sight-seeing activities.
14980600,257284061,2018-04-25,11269044,Catherine,I had a really good stay.  The place is exactly as it appears in the photos.  It was lovely and quiet for sleeping.  Even when the hosts were downstairs watching TV I could hear nothing.  It's also on a nice quiet street.  Private bathroom and parking were excellent (although the bathroom is not ensuite).  The hosts are perfectly friendly but not into any chit chat which might have made it less comfortable to use the kitchen back deck etc. if I had had time or inclination.  As it was I virtually never saw them so privacy was great.  The TV is huge and has lots of channels but still nothing much to watch which is no fault of the hosts.    If you're looking to make friends and meet people this might not be the best option but I would definitely stay here again if looking for a quiet place to sleep.
192860,17282773,2014-08-10,17117653,Amanda Merrilee,Great spacious place centrally located! Paul was a great host and provided us with all we needed he even left snacks in the fridge. I would definitely recommend this place!

1369606,17372122,2014-08-11,4299132,Diego,My favorite stay in my vacation in Canada. There are so many great things to say about Martin and his wife Leslie. First off their house is beautiful and the room we stayed in was charming. They have everything you need and the shower is awesome! The place is very near dundas st. which makes for a great stroll and a perfect way to get to know the city. Martin is a generous host who is full of knowledge about the great city of Toronto. I would recommend this place for anyone.

Highly recommend this place.  Thanks so much to Amanda."

Everything you needed supplied in condo for basic meal preparation. Super clean. Lots if top quality linens supplied. Really great experience. Only slight con if you need the extra futons for sleeping very uncomfortable. Otherwise all good.
15239234,413415772,2019-02-17,51752368,Ariana,My partner and I stayed at Laura’s place for his birthday. The location was amazing!! So close to great bars shops and places to eat.

Parking was a little unclear because GPS  took us to one street but visitor parking was on the other side. Once we figured it out it was fine.  I would definitely recommend staying here.
36076435,550351890,2019-10-18,282152468,Amber,"*First Time Airbnb User*

Amazing location if you want to explore the downtown area! You're a walking distance from a lot of the downtown attractions and public transportation is steps away if needed. The unit was decent and had the essentials Jenil I was able to reach no problem.

Just a few minor issues we had was the parking because it was full for the free area everytime we checked and the lot directly across the street was to tight for our vehicle so we ended up paying for parking right around the corner. If you parked before 7:00 pm (or 6:00 pm maybe?) you have to pay for the hourly or pay 15$ and be out at 6:00 am. So we had to get up at 6:00 am to go throw more money on it because Toronto parking is insanely on point about parking laws/tickets. So we ended up paying 30$ in total for parking which kind of sucked since we budgeted/expected to not have to pay for it.

Also the tv is an older model (not old old tho) we just weren't able to smart view anything to it when the Ps4 wouldn't work so it  kind or annoying not being able to watch anything well winding down for the night and it was kind of hard to sleep with the construction in the morning with no background noise. I'm a extremely light sleeper tho and I always sleep with a TV and or fan on but for a normal sleeper you'd likely not notice it at all

Overall it was good for what we needed but those few issues were kind of frustrating lol"
17682453,527314237,2019-09-10,85903584,Vrunda,They do not provide basic amenities in the kitchen (like bounty) and in bedrooms (like hangers). The place is extremely noisy at night. Once the bathrooms in all floors were extremely dirty and the host took more than 2 hours to clean them. They provide very little value for the money they charge.
21097583,316107495,2018-08-30,208830890,周,Very nice and clean room with great hosts and one super cute dog!
12940734,249744160,2018-04-02,49487459,Sara,"I've asked them to improve a safety hazard in the shower.  If they haven't just note that the water gets very hot & don't stand in the shower stall trying to figure out the weird temperature control.
Otherwise everything was fine."
25232256,340938864,2018-10-25,167155552,Moritz,This was my second time staying in - and enjoying - Ben's apartment in Kensington Market.  Highly recommended.
38775636,541018246,2019-10-04,15517887,Stephanie,Great communication however parking a bit confusing and cost 40 dollars for one night which isn’t too bad considering location. Right across from the scotiabank arena which we were there for a concert so it was perfect. Great price and cute condo! We would definitely stay again!

5557092,264322030,2018-05-13,130069125,Jean-François,Dans l’annonce (et les instructions une fois sur place) il y avait mention d’un matelas supplémentaire qui malheureusement n’était plus disponible une fois sur les lieux.  De plus il n’y a pas de rideaux dans le salon alors ce n’est pas l’idéal de dormir dans cette pièce.  L’appartement est donc idéal pour 2 et non 3 ou 4 voyageurs.  Aussi 1 seul rouleau de papier hygiénique était disponible pour 4 adultes pour 48h.  Toutefois la location est excellente l’accès très facile et l’appartement est très propre.  Merci Slim pour le séjour.

13174614,78641456,2016-06-08,12130834,Jon,Weiru was very helpful before and during our stay.  The place was clean and had a good location. We had to pickup the keys about 15 min walk from the place which was kind of annoying. The bed was uncomfortable. My gf got a sore back and it was clearly a very cheap mattress. Other than that it was ok.

Great place called Evviva right on the corner for breakfast. Check in was super easy. The space was clean and quiet. We found parking a block from the building on lower Simcoe. Great communication with Ramy. We would definitely stay again.

8921021,277120329,2018-06-15,97096027,Arron,Great location downtown however if your driving you’ll have to use public parking a block away. The apartment has everything you need and is super clean. This is a must stay place in Toronto.
1202446,6743606,2013-08-23,3632560,Lena,We haven't met Brahm personally but our stay was really good: everything concerning our arrival and depart was very quickly arranged we got the keys without problems and the description of how to get to the apartment were detailed and clear. The room as well as the whole apartment were kept clean. We only stayed one night but we enjoyed it a lot. One could even see the CN Tower out of the window of our room. The only small minus: in our room was no air conditioning but only a fan... a little bit hot during summer. Big advantage: apartment located in the heart of Toronto's entertainment district many clubs restaurants bars etc. around the corner. Good access to public transportation (around 25 min to Main Bus Terminal where Megabus and Greyhound leave). Brahm was very accommodating and he even allowed us to store our luggage over day which we could pick up late in the evening.

Our family had a great time visiting with each other in comfort. The children slept well enjoyed the toys while adults browsed wonderful shelves of books. The well stocked kitchen allowed us to cook a number of family meals. Great place in a great location.

7253645,64574304,2016-03-05,59925113,Pradip,Tom was very helpful. This tiny room has a character of its own its by far the most equipped place Iv seen. Thanks Tom and madeline!!
25306646,487906419,2019-07-14,49965360,Christy,A clean and beautiful stay. Ivan was a very professional and friendly host who is quick to respond when needed. He ensures you’re comfortable even in the smallest details. I would definitely stay here again!

31103469,499572977,2019-07-31,37292490,Blanche,Felix was very helpful. The place itself is smaller than it looks in pictures. Tall people be warned - the ceiling is about 6'5 or even lower in some spots. The flooring is a bit weird and gets slippery/wet easily. The location is nice right by a charming little park.
29890444,492832200,2019-07-21,114097969,Nixon,Decent place

20693466,205636442,2017-10-22,17272071,Nicole,Khoa’s place was great for timing and for location purposes. It is such a central location for good food and great shops. Queen street west is the best location in the city. The room is in close quarters with the host (IE right next door) so if you are looking for more privacy this might not be the place for you. He is very thorough with directions and it is very helpful. However with being in close  Quarters he was around the apartment the entire time. We felt uncomfortable asking for coffee or water in the morning. He also cornered us at night asking us not to leave windows open in the room late night at night because of his AC. it was really warm there and it was a little uncomfortable to have the convo with him on our last night. Overall great stay. Comfortable room. Not a lot of privacy but worth it for the location.
30439071,460976339,2019-05-30,229180048,Chandler,If you want to stay somewhere where the family is welcoming and you’re in a close area to everything; definitely suggest staying here.
17327411,289967439,2018-07-13,166363658,Christina,Great location which worked out very well for our visit to Toronto.  It was very convenient to have a kitchen for breakfasts.  The fish tank is very cool! Parking was easy.  We used the pool several times are really enjoyed that as well. Thank you!
11324662,312988633,2018-08-24,204180800,Antonia,Espectacular e inigualable experiencia tanto por las vistas como por la ubicación sobre todo si llegas en tren por la cercanía de la estación de trenes así como por la situación estratégica para acceder a pie a las cosas mas relevantes que visitar en el centro de Toronto. Totalmente recomendable.
22062857,346152973,2018-11-07,122731926,Rita,Great location in Kensington Market that is close to many food places and public transportation. The apartment is decorated very nicely and extremely clean. Great value and would definitely recommend.
24558138,534998216,2019-09-23,19859114,Arlene,My husband and I stayed in Nima and Sadaf's place for three nights. The suite is spacious clean and comfortable--the pictures are accurate. The bed was great. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes pots and pans but the cooking facilities are limited -- a two-burner stove top and a microwave (as well as all the small appliances you would need for breakfast such as toaster coffee maker kettle).  But then why would you want to stay in and cook when a host of interesting restaurants are steps away on Yonge Street? Despite the proximity to busy Yonge Street the suite is quiet situated on a pleasant residential street. Perfect combination! Nima and Sada were extremely helpful and gracious hosts always available should you have questions or need anything. We will definitely want to stay here on our next visit to Toronto.
18457960,277568586,2018-06-16,192152845,Janett,Hamid is a great host.

18911442,479825657,2019-07-01,132734327,Bradley,I really cant emphasize enough of how nice of a place this is. Unique rooms decor and all the things you want and expect from an overnight stay. The pictures youll take alone are worth the stay. If its in your budget then this is 100% worth it. Kris was an amazing host as well communicative throughout the days before and during my stay as well. I'd recommend it to everyone.
3341643,178969231,2017-08-06,834273,Banna,Eva's home is in central Toronto close to shops and restuarants (we barely even had to Uber anywhere just walked). The home itself is beautiful! And has everything you would need while away from home. Eva was very communicative and helpful throughout the entire process. We thank you very much!
35934544,570895913,2019-11-30,34714670,Nicole,The apartment is quite old floors cracking and a lot of noise from the street specially on weekends we had trouble sleeping one night cause of the music somewhere downstairs.

29359988,434779313,2019-04-08,171688274,Grace,Very clean comfortable and good value. Footsteps from the floor above were quite loud at night would recommend earplugs if you are a light sleeper.

25544264,434163492,2019-04-07,245224825,Laura,The place was exceptional! It was clean cozy and quiet! It is very close to UofT and Kensignton market. I could not ask for a better experience and would definitely stay again if I am ever back in Toronto!
10355497,493449818,2019-07-22,38983532,Prachi,"We stayed at Greta's place during our visit to Toronto. We stayed for four nights. Greta was flexible and allowed us an early check in. She was super prompt in responding to all my queries. The location is great. The two storey home is at walking distance or cheap Uber ride to many Toronto attractions. Boris cat is very friendly. 
The home smelled little weird everytime I entered it after spending some time outside (not sure if it's pet smell). There is no AC and this is mentioned in the listing.  if you are planning to stay here during summer months be prepared to sweat a lot in the night. There is a small fan in the room however it's very old and could not provide air to person sleeping on the other side of the bed. There are two windows in the bedroom. None of the windows had curtains and one of the windows did not have blinds. So it was very difficult to sleep in the morning. The bedsheet was torn slightly and did not seem fresh. This place is very affordable however I probably would not stay here again."
35513966,519957861,2019-08-29,17907768,Thibault,"Catalina place is situation at an amazing location if you come to visit Toronto for a couple days.

The kitchen is perfect and the fact that there is a supermarket just down the building makes it very convenient.

The space feels a bit smaller than what the pictures look like but the beds were incredibly comfortable and the flat was super clean.

Super fast WiFi as well so that’s definitely a plus!"
27100818,354878657,2018-12-02,173365777,Michael,Expect welcoming personalities and friendliness when you stay at Martin and his wife's house. We were greeted warmly and treated with utmost kindness and respect; furthermore the house was very clean and accommodating. I would recommend a stay here to anybody visiting the Toronto area!
21977950,524758735,2019-09-06,287820951,Catherine,"The ensuite certainly lived up to it ads. It was new professionally set up most important is sparkling clean...
Fei is an experienced host he also response simultaneously and yet gives privacy when needed. It was an enjoyable stay."

23041773,487093046,2019-07-13,19432457,Gorka,Lo que más nos gustó la ubicación del alojamiento. A Ey no le vimos en los 4 días que estuvimos la entrada y salida en la casa se hacen con una clave.
25966573,406996004,2019-01-31,152469689,Heather,This is a great place My husband and I stayed here. Very accommodating Clean quiet area close to grocery store and within walking distance to the school.  I’ll definitely stay here again.

23217242,279802261,2018-06-21,114276995,Melissa,Great location near activities (rogers center ripley’s aquarium CN tower restaurants etc.) Nice view (same as seen on pictures) smaller than expected but perfect for 2 persons.  Pretty clean and great communication with the host.
23614636,305048546,2018-08-10,8388718,Carlos Graham,"The apt is located directly on King Street with readily-available trams running and connecting to the subway so there is absolutely no problem getting around the city. The area is very safe upscale and there are convenience stores (Loblow's Shopper's Drugs LCBO etc.)  within walking distance.
Like everywhere the apt has a couple of minor quirks but it's functional stylish clean and very comfortable - excellent for the city stay.
Nasif is a great host - very accommodating easy to speak with and to contact. All in all highly recommended."
12301555,338490391,2018-10-19,82201081,Dean,Very nice clean compact space.  The location is excellent right next to entertainment and literally right across from the train/bus/metro station.

7114009,518475996,2019-08-26,236202558,Soomi,I definitely would like to stay here again. It was one of the most unforgettable memories in my entire life. Kathleen is the most generous and sweetest person. She really welcome and care about the guest. Millie is really lovable and easygoing dog so don’t be afraid of her. The space was so comfy relaxing and sparkling nite and clean. Also since the entire house has its own characteristics it makes the time at the place so special. I strongly recommend this place:)
20440144,187220400,2017-08-26,85552474,Calvin,Ewa's place is so clean and right at the heart of central Toronto. Just love it.

19432168,182001321,2017-08-13,143361342,Loïc,Endroit très pratique (au centre) et pro. Fonctionnement assez proche de l’hôtel car le service assuré est super mais nous n'avons pas pu réellement rencontré les hôtes en définitive.
14733021,323000800,2018-09-14,144458126,Justin,Great spot in an awesome part of Toronto. Was able to walk literally everywhere. The check in process is complex but just follow the instructions. Finding my way to the elevator from the parking spot in the garage was confusing and I don't think I ever got it right.
16013706,180911997,2017-08-11,142515538,Nicholas,"Very friendly and makes sure that he does everything he can to make your stay pleasant.
The room was booked so he offered to give up his room for my stay. Very nice guy!"
843521,24707670,2015-01-02,21247422,Nancy,"Given that this was our first Airbnb experience we were so glad to have Alana helping us through the process.  She was readily available to answer questions along the way and giving recommendations as needed.  A long list of restaurants and shops was appreciated.
Her apartment on Lonsdale was the perfect combination of access to everything in Toronto yet with a quiet more residential feel to this inner-city neighborhood.  The building is older and therefore quieter than much of the new construction today.  As described the subway was a short walk away and even a cab ride from downtown was quite affordable at night.
Her apartment is comfortable and the ideal size for a couple yet we were able to entertain our married children/spouses for dinner with ease.  She has recently renovated the kitchen which has plenty of space if you like to cook in.
City parking is a huge expense in Toronto so the free underground garage was an important factor in picking Alana's apartment.
A great experience and a very good value."
1202734,290522346,2018-07-14,178239500,Alyssa,Small but cozy and well decorated. Next door to Kensington Market and parking is always a plus.
22147197,348597270,2018-11-14,143980526,Andrew,Clean and cozy place! Angie was very responsive helpful and check-in was a breeze! Close to Chinatown so food is always available. There is also parking close by (about 5mins walk) at a reasonable rate. Would recommend!
19532125,231497670,2018-02-01,141194775,Belinda,Lovely family friendly unit with its own kitchen so if you feel like cooking rather than eating out you can do that. The host was very prompt in dealing with my enquiries and the unit is in a great location close to public transportation so it’s easy to get around town.
2618025,79695224,2016-06-13,61523768,James,Ed's place is great. Clean perfect location and true to the photos. The deck is amazing. I really enjoyed my stay at Ed's place and would definitely stay there again. 
4615440,189703952,2017-09-02,146232382,Frank,房间干净整洁交通便利可以停车｡Bloor上的交通略有一些吵｡
33592991,472400168,2019-06-19,181615548,Sam,It's a lovely spotlessly clean space in the best location in the city. The coffee machine is a Keurig so you can come prepared. Parking is expensive  in the neighbourhood so factor that. But overall Dev's place is great value very comfortable and easy to get settled into. A hotel in this area with less space and convenience would be easily double the price.
27438371,324180007,2018-09-16,15897491,Gregory,Wonderful place the pictures don't do it justice what so ever. Absolutely stunning view we really had a great time.

22293661,497388442,2019-07-28,249280662,Emma,The place was in a great spot. Not too far from the inner city. It looks exactly like it shows in the pictures that Manny provided.
3877705,107414206,2016-10-10,6541461,Susanne,"Nice and safe area. Close to public transportation restaurants coffee shops grocery shopping and so on. Lesley wasn't home as we arrived but the communication was very well so we find the apartment easily. Everything was perfect prepared. The wifi access drinks in the refrigerator towels bed and more than we needed. The flat is very spacious and the bed is so !!!!!! comfortable:))))  Lesley says hello the next morning and we felt very welcoming! She gave us also good suggestions for our stay in Toronto! 
Should we ever visit Toronto again we like to stay here again. "
13669058,160109559,2017-06-12,1799896,James,"This is a brilliantly located apartment and Jennifer was a very helpful and communicative host. 

The only issue that my colleagues encountered during their stay was that the apartment was quick to heat up in the summer months - but there is air conditioning to help with that!"
18915367,481940341,2019-07-05,130066547,Yuzhe,a convenient place with great view

4438046,23913049,2014-12-14,23355921,Jason,Madhur is a fantastic host and welcomed me with beverages and a detailed note of the landscape in the neighborhood. His place is in a great location at front and spadina just minutes away from the financial district and queen west. I highly recommend staying at Madhur's his place was as advertised and at a very reasonable price.
31014160,503143232,2019-08-05,62158644,Cathy,Tom was a very nice host who wants to make you to feel at home. Got the chance to meet his family including his cute little daughter. Since they live right above you you might hear them now and then but did not disturb us. Spacious basement apartment with full kitchen separate bedrooms with nice beds. Quiet neighbourhood with restaurants quite nearby. Have your own parking place.
26871586,562178645,2019-11-10,16175068,Keila,Freeda was very easy to communicate with and exceptionally responsive. I stayed here while attending a weekend long conference at the Toronto Congress Centre - Freeda's place was very close had a few fast food places a Shoppers Tim Horton's and a little grocery stores in < 5 minutes walking distance. The neighbourhood felt safe. Her space was just what I needed - a quiet no-fuss comfortable to get some rest. Recommend!
26628568,537389488,2019-09-28,90511817,Deidre,What a great home nice touches and deck area !
27077883,528154134,2019-09-12,31449345,Nigel,Very pleased we chose Sasha’s apartment for our two day stay in Toronto - perfect location walkable (almost!) everywhere and really close to CN tower Ripley’s Harbour tour. The apartment was a quiet haven at the end of each day’s sightseeing/shopping schedule and with two bathrooms and three bedrooms easily coped with our grown up kids. Would definitely stay here again next time!
33587601,477063846,2019-06-27,211107313,Lee,Very clean and comfortable spot exactly as advertised. Amazing location steps from Bathurst station. Very clean quiet and all amenities available. Highly recommended and would most definitely stay again!
32388246,566083254,2019-11-18,217401843,Luke,We had a great stay here. It’s ideally located and only a short walk away from many places. With it being an apartment was great as there’s a shop next door and could get in the essentials. Space is lovely and comfortable and was ideal for us as a couple. Couple of lights not working and couldn’t get the washing machine working but it didn’t affect our stay and would definitely return. Check in was a bit confusing as the front desk didn’t know if they had the keys or not and we had to ring but again was sorted out in minutes!
6702138,430383385,2019-03-30,178868552,Twyla,I stayed in one of the bedrooms in the basement for a month while taking a course in the area.  It was very close to transit restaurants many stores and other businesses so you don't have to travel far to find everything if you don't want to.  The Wifi was great and the kitchen was well stocked with dishes pots etc.  There is the typical stuff that comes along with sharing common areas with other people and being in the basement.  Communication was good with Maxine & other travellers.  I would recommend this place to others who need a simple & reasonably price place to stay in Toronto.
21798580,303120580,2018-08-06,84732611,Verdant J.,I like this place a lot and plan to return again.
31242978,444889970,2019-04-28,115255937,Flo,One of the most comfortable Airbnb places I ever stayed in. Thorough self check-in instructions easy parking on site location is spot-on  fantastic and vibrant neighborhood homey like upper floor townhouse unit nicely decorated and filled with natural light. Overall: A+
2016823,240317033,2018-03-04,145964954,Lisa,Beautiful place with wall of windows. Centrally located and close to coffee restaurants and entertainment! Safe and secure building too. Mark was great- met us at check-in and was very accommodating. Would surely stay here again!
30541017,468103188,2019-06-11,6481619,Judith,Lisa's place is lovely. Its well situated clean...everyone is helpful...I liked it especially as a single woman traveling
34205273,485320778,2019-07-10,252422352,Ell,The others living in this house are very helpful and nice. There's A/C in the house but it doesn't reach the room. They sent me some excuse about the vent not working but there's no vent in the room. They also said someone would come install a unit. I stayed a week and they didn't show up. In a sunny room having no A/C is terrible during the summer. The kitchen isn't well kept but the bathroom is okay and the bedroom is clean.
20827774,275254634,2018-06-10,90007579,Sergio,Very well located comfortable check-in/out and enough for a couple spending some days in Toronto.
553972,113014353,2016-11-09,1240033,Sandy,I had a wonderful stay at Caroline's beautiful home. The home is very clean and beautifully decorated. Having full use of the kitchen was terrific as my son lives close by and he came over for dinner a couple of nights. Caroline was extremely helpful friendly and thoughtful. She is very sensitive to the needs of her guests. I thoroughly recommend her property as a lovely place to stay.
11720805,239396547,2018-03-01,2755840,Harry,Kevin's place was great. The location is really convenient with alot of good places to eat nearby. The condo itself is beautifully decorated clean and has everything you could need. I didn't get a chance to meet Kevin but based on our online communication he was very attentive nice and quick to respond. I would definitely recommend staying here and I would surely return here during my next trip to Toronto!
16337877,199293069,2017-10-01,78089965,Samantha,Sindy was awesome! Great communication and cute little house in Kensington. The house itself was awesome with outlets on each side of the bed. WiFi is not YouTube friendly as it is a bit laggy other than that awesome value for the location.
23830190,284503335,2018-07-01,195498493,Rex,Nice place 
29990945,353773642,2018-11-29,130635512,Paul,Great location and a really nice place. Definitely recommend.
15701100,425013587,2019-03-17,73570552,Emily,My partner and I stayed at Lena and Dimitri’s for four nights. The space is very stylish and clean and had everything we needed during our stay! The check in and communication was also very quick and easy. The location is in walking distance from lots of great shopping and restaurants. We like to walk when on vacation but found that almost everywhere we wanted to go was 30 minutes or less to walk! Overall we had a great stay and would definitely stay here again!
18160268,546487455,2019-10-13,24338804,Paul,A great “at home” experience in a vibrant neighborhood. Full kitchen was very nicely outfitted. Lots of additional amenities and touches throughout. Very good and fast communication.
36660481,520489039,2019-08-30,109762688,Steve,Good space in a vibrant neighborhood.
19315382,209676234,2017-11-05,82076404,Elizabeth,Excellent location!!  Will and Ashley allowed us an early check-in as the unit was available. Very clean  condo with great access to all transportation and right next to Union station.  The condo was very comfortable with views of the lake and islands.  Loved the clean and simple decor--perfect for two.  Would definitely stay there again.
29861482,361008774,2018-12-22,231127322,David,Place itself is very nice. The back entrance is pretty sketch tho and I tripped over a wood block. Place is even better than the photos. Unfortunately the heater is central controlled by the main floor. There were a group of people partying upstairs so they left the entire basement freezing.
7196373,283299278,2018-06-29,76908329,Elaine,Good to stay. Nice house and lovely place to visit.
14369423,145866922,2017-04-20,85544084,Arlene,Great view and walking distance from Ripley's Aquarium and  CN Tower.
16621379,199248810,2017-10-01,137169698,Kristal,Christina was a great host with excellent communication and flexibility! She saved us with this place when another host canceled last minute but we were happy to be in such a great location! You really can't beat the access to Queen St. and Downtown! Other reviews accurately point out that what you sacrifice in luxury for being in the basement unit is made up for by the location and as just a place to crash for a few nights it fits the bill!
28138650,560731529,2019-11-07,136928153,Andrew,Incredible location and experience especially for the price. Tons or restaurants shops coffeeshops and things to do in the area and within walking distance. Would definitely recommend staying here and we hope to stay with Galina again on our next visit to Toronto!
16369202,466673995,2019-06-09,253309230,Batuhan,Ryan was a great host! He always answered our questions and requests rapidly from the beginning till our check-out date. House is located max 5 min walking to bus and streetcar stops. Ryan provided some snacks and soft beverages for our stay. The amenities were actually the same as said. House was really clean and tidy. Also there is an Apple TV if you like to spend time in house by watching movies!
15533980,222350017,2017-12-29,18581686,Rauful,"The best part about the apartment was the location. It was very close to all the attractions about 10-15mins drive. Parking was not an issue either Zaid got us the visitor permit.  
The only con about the apartment was there was no lock on the bedroom and bathroom. 
The bedroom and bathroom were clean. I would pick this place again in future if I decide to visit Toronto again."
5286926,184443340,2017-08-19,115191859,Cheryl,Michelle's cozy  contemporary home is everything we were hoping for and more! We love to cook and the kitchen is well appointed  and BBQ as well! The house is beautifully decorated  relaxing and suited our family . We loved the two minute walk to Loblaws which had all we needed for groceries. It is close to transit and in walking distance of great restaurants in the Annex! Michelle made everything easy and smooth as this was our first Airbnb experience in travelling. We would highly recommend this as a home away from home!
30274164,531908176,2019-09-18,79051958,Annika,Anna was very friendly and answered our questions immediatly even at late hours. The apartment is nice and has everything you need to stay for a couple of days. The neighborhood (Leslieville) is a great place to go out for food/drinks with nice little shops. It is very easy to get to downtown via public transportation. Because the apartment is located at the main street you hear cars and streetcars also during night. Unfortunately there were loud construction noises in the house during daytime too. But in general I definitely recommend the apartment!
32019484,529272518,2019-09-14,78260952,Sylvie,Valya is a super host and super nice.  Very responsive and helpful.

23110484,441240551,2019-04-21,51413793,Aravind,Amazing place with hosts who are extremely responsive. The location is incredible as well! Highly recommended
1554581,22161864,2014-10-31,22691095,Kirk,"Anne was there to greet me when I first arrived and she showed me around the property personally. 

The description of the property is very accurate the pictures are real.

The location is perfect. Very close to public transport bike rental car rental restaurants cafes and bars (incl. 3x24 Hours mini markets) . 5 mins walk to Kensington market University of Toronto. 10 mins walk to China Town and the subway station.  

Despite its central location the property is very quiet. It also has a private balcony which is the perfect place to have a cup of tea in the late afternoon. 

Kitchen was fully equipped and Anne assured me the washing machine was available if I needed it. (I never ended up using it.)

Anne was always available when I needed assistance. "
33593969,536823933,2019-09-27,105445510,Manda,Modern cozy clean condo with everything you could possibly need in the heart of Toronto. Claudia was super quick to respond to questions and offer helpful suggestions. Great stay!
20957125,239198029,2018-02-28,21218232,Barb & Mike,Close to subway and walkable to shops restaurants and high park. Kyle was responsive to all inquires and a great host. Location is pet friendly and we recommend highly.

8195595,316639263,2018-08-31,168036015,Dorinda,I would definitely stay again! The place was very clean great vibe! Raoul was great! He was very welcoming and made us feel at ease right away. He respected that we wanted our space and made sure we had everything we needed. I'd recommend Raoul's lovely place to anyone who's looking for a cozy/chill space. The room is in great walking distance to many places. Overall great experience!
23342739,292235325,2018-07-17,79989758,Elliot,A good place to stay near the airport (15 mins drive). Clean and comfortable. Nice memory foam bed. Very quiet area
7107331,46061668,2015-09-07,42868507,Faisal,The host were very friendly and they did anything that makes our vacation amazing. The house is enough for 6 or 7 people with a beautiful design. 
23013595,260644710,2018-05-04,21747776,Eva,A fantastic Suite with all the amenities and plenty of room.  Very clean and comfortable. I'll book again when back in TO on business.  Last but not least excellent price value which included an underground parking spot.
17794236,555488426,2019-10-27,95353715,Fernanda,Bonnie was a perfect host. The apartment itself is very charming and is located in a very good place where you have  easy access to everything you possibly need. I highly recommend this apartment and host.
17088112,202037178,2017-10-09,70782771,Yolanda,amazing apartment great location and views (especially at night)
24755985,535919557,2019-09-25,54073795,LaMani,Zoe was an amazing host. Her place is beautiful and located in a perfect area. She was overall very accommodating. Would definitely stay here again!!
9969830,340000028,2018-10-22,54799766,Stacey,Vasily was a great host! I would not hesitate to stay here again.
14084357,124733643,2017-01-02,47873260,Amanda,Great location. Really comfortable bed and heated bathroom floors. Host was helpful with local sights and provided everything needed for a lovely stay. Great spot!

The bed is really comfortable the place clean close to the beach bars restaurants bakeries and transport. Christina provided us with lots of useful tips which really added to the experience. Both my sister and I would recommend this place! Thank you Christina!
37974087,555281829,2019-10-27,136251319,Brianne,Wonderful hosts and great location! We really enjoyed our time here.

14842139,329369489,2018-09-28,20437489,Taylor,Great Location in the entertainment district! Good Value! Will stay again!
13044092,188514457,2017-08-29,6560364,Ryan,Kushagra's unit was perfect. Great part of town for all things downtown Toronto and very close to Union Station (gateway to everywhere else). Success is in the simplicity and the absolute essentials (plus some nice extras) are incredibly presented and offered. Zero headaches or issues and a check in / check out procedure that made me feel like I was welcome from minute one. Highly recommend.
13081577,154242770,2017-05-23,10867235,Anaïs,"We had an amazing stay at Desirée and Martin's place. They warmly welcomed us with some sweets and champagne Desirée was easy to reach out as it was our first time in Toronto she pointed out some places to visit and the apartment is provided with a really nice city guide. The apartment was perfectly clean and the photos give you a really good insight of the place. We really had a great experience.
Thanks again Desirée and Martin !! "
10573722,188784704,2017-08-30,47511587,Tony,"The adage of 'you get what you pay for' holds true. I was way too tired to drive home but didn't want to spend a lot on accommodations so after a quick search on AirBnB I found this as an option and told myself... ""how bad could it be"". I had very very low expectations considering the price but was happy to see an e-mail/message very shortly after booking with information for getting in (automated). After a quick drive followed the instructions and quietly entered the shared house. Everyone must have been sleeping because I didn't see anyone nor did I hear any noises in the house. Walked to the room assigned to me and was pleasantly surprised. It was clean and comfortable. The only downside were blinds that didn't close so anyone from out back had full view of the room. Slept comfortably until about 5am when I was awoken to the smell of smoking (which I loathe). Turns out a few residents were smoking behind the building and despite the window being closed it seemed like all the smokey air was making its way into my room. Managed to doze off for another hour or so before finally getting up and taking a shower (bring your own towels because they don't provide any) and then quietly leaving the house shortly thereafter. Overall I was pleased with the stay given how inexpensive it was and how low my expectations were but this certainly wouldn't be the case for everyone!"
13182530,255455590,2018-04-20,140963865,Jitka,Good place to stay. Would stay again thus recommend it.
17790383,173549644,2017-07-23,33749269,Joshua,Lawrence's place is very large and offers plenty of space. The location is quite central to everything (even in the early hours of the night). Cleanliness is top-notch. We were in town for the triathlon and the apartment offered everything we needed for our stay.
3859494,99652831,2016-09-05,85966198,Pincie,"Everything are well arranged.

20465533,322621185,2018-09-13,24308699,Justin,This was my second time staying at Hassen's place and I couldn't recommend it more heartily. He's a great host super-responsive and the condo is as clean spacious and inviting as advertised.
15649505,179823463,2017-08-08,29802529,Mandip,5 stars! Great place to stay and it's honestly a really good price for what you're getting. 3 bedrooms 2 baths and a living area in such a great part of the city is unheard of. Jay was a great host and communication was quick and simple. For the small problems I did have (somebody stole our parking spot) he quickly solved it for us in a matter of 5 minutes. He's a great host along with a great place which is why I rate it 5 stars!
13189270,201590561,2017-10-08,55293760,Anton,Jonathan and Jenny were fantastic hosts. Couldn't ask for better. Also their place is in a perfect location to get to the subway. The place was also very clean. If you're looking for a private bedroom near the subway you wont find better for thr price.
28286372,529242698,2019-09-14,170453590,Samuel,Nice place close to casino and small restaurants nearby
12713919,157822501,2017-06-04,25917139,Simon,Great as usual! Whenever we travel to Toronto we always stay with Jose
16025066,236086777,2018-02-18,62242417,Lydia,The Alley House was perfect! The house was clean and well-equipped. The neighborhood has endless options for dining coffee and shopping. I highly recommend Kathleen's place!
16392995,177721418,2017-08-03,32846525,Shilpa,Qui's place is very central exactly what I needed for my parents when they came to visit me. Qui is a very responsive and great host who attended to our needs very well! There were some issues with the AC not working in the building which was mostly resolved by a portable unit that was provided instead in the condo with some of the necessities not being replenished (which Qui quickly replenished!) and with some of the cleaning in the kitchen prior to my parents moving in there (Qui was notified and promised he would rectify with the cleaning company). All in all would recommend a stay here!
21082785,477087257,2019-06-27,3587306,Erin & Carole,Great stay exactly as advertised very clean great communication from Vince. We'd stay again for sure.

4733208,75535724,2016-05-22,70982291,Curtis,Very clean house and Tammy was very accommodating towards all our needs. Bed was a little stiff but it actually helped with some back pain I had been having so no complaints about that.
22726948,349483496,2018-11-17,66439923,Eeva,Nice apartment and very centrally located! We enjoyed our stay. The only issue was that the building elevator was broken with only one elevator running for the whole building. This left us waiting for an elevator often for 20+ minutes. I am 8 months pregnant and my mother in law has bad legs so climbing stairs to 19th floor was not an option. Other than that pleasant experience!
11322792,470737666,2019-06-16,7187041,Hannah,This airbnb is dreamy. Gorgeous place I love the neighborhood and Darius the host is terrific.

13476773,189414786,2017-09-01,11837499,Charles,"Location is fantastic for access to transit restaurants cafes.  Being right on Queen St does make it noisy.  Generally clean up to date.  Good communication with owner and easy ""check-in"" process."
985498,145877654,2017-04-20,123981743,Harm,Great location and perfect host. Good communication through out. Cleaning was little late on day due to previous guest leaving late but was resolved very quickly and did a super job
22151084,229005210,2018-01-21,167762549,Abigail,Mel was a great host! She was unable to greet us when we arrived but she provided excellent instructions on where to park and how to get into the space! The beds were VERY comfortable and she has decorated the place very nicely. Ten minute walk to great restaurants shopping and bars. Would recommend others to stay at Mel's!

32335934,509551153,2019-08-14,269626837,Kay,We can’t say enough great things about Amy and Henry’s studio! First the location is perfect. Close to everything incredible views and convenient. Second more space then we thought. It is a studio but plenty of room for two and a toddler. Very secure parking clean and a safe space for a little one. Lastly you couldn’t ask for better hosts. Excellent communication and such quick responses!
22147197,499502878,2019-07-31,58048617,Jeannie,"Angie was a fantastic host. Instant replies and checked in on us throughout our stay. The location can't be beat right next to a street of trendy shops and restaurants.

AirBnB was exactly as described and Angie was great about our check in & check out.

Space was very clean and spacious for 2 people. Bathroom is on the smaller side for those who like to get ready and spread out their amenities...but there is a full body mirror in the living room.

Also the mattress is so comfortable! Would definitely stay again."

27338715,454174294,2019-05-17,257993555,Vince,"Shawn’s property sets the bar for Airbnb properties. I was apprehensive for my first ever Airbnb experience but Shawn has thought of just about everything you might forget. I was in town for a 1 week training session that was 1 block away and simply wanted a quiet place to come back to. I had classmates in the hotels that were jealous. A couple of must do’s:
Rent a bike and ride down the waterfront (check the weather first so you don’t ride into a hailstorm.
Grab a beaver tail right across the street. 
Ride the streetcar it stops right across the street. 
Workout (the gym gets crowded between 5 and 6)

Highly recommend Shawn’s place."

4563146,196007915,2017-09-21,142028400,Zaldo,Adoramos nossa estadia com Jane e Chris! Ficamos hospedados 5 dias. O quarto é exatamente como está na descrição e na foto. A cama extremamente confortável e apesar de não oferecer café da manhã há no quarto cafeteira (com pó para café chá açúcar etc) frigobar e chaleira elétrica. Para nós foi suficiente pois há um mercado super perto. Compramos alguns itens e preparamos nosso café da manhã antes de sair todos os dias. A varandinha do quarto é um charme. O banheiro é limpo e o chuveiro muito bom! Como informado no anúncio o banheiro é dividido com o hóspede do outro quarto mas durante a nossa estadia esse outro quarto não havia sido alugado. Apenas no dia em que estávamos saindo esse outro quarto foi ocupado. Tudo é muito organizado e explicado por Jane. Ela esteve disponível sempre que precisávamos. Recomendamos muito essa super host! :)
20902125,547070787,2019-10-14,55184890,Eddie,"This is was place definitely a hidden gem where you can experience the non-tourist side of Toronto. Frank's apartment located in a safe and lively neighborhood where there are tons of shops bars restaurants and take out. There is even a bank around the corner from the apartment to get some Canadian cash if you need it.

The place is some distance from downtown Toronto. Luckily there is a subway in walkable distance. The subways do act funny during the weekends. So you can take always take the bus or the street car. It takes awhile getting use to but they are pretty easy to use.

Frank was very fast responding and his co host Lambro was helpful and friendly. Would definitely book here again."
20911294,224859391,2018-01-04,157326124,Elizabeth,"This place was mad hype for starters we walk in and there are guest slippers and a bottle of complementary wine awaiting us a real power move by the host. Followed by decorations and views that are directly out of your favourite pintrest board and insta accounts. The mood this place sets is a mixture of sexy business with casual fun. The pool/sauna/hottub we’re easily accessible and a great way to unwind after a long day of exploring all the wonderful experiences the city has to offer. Which brings me to my next point the location... an absolutely ideal location for those without a car who would like to see the best of Toronto. No doubt the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at. 
Book this Airbnb for a good time."

The inside is very inviting and cozy and makes for a great quite place to get away with the convenience of being in the city.  City transit is right at the doorstep and the Eatons Centre is a 40 minute walk away.  25 minute walk to the Distillery District.
All the conveniences were supplied and the shower was great.  The loft area might be a bit tricky for older people but was a great place to sleep.
A very inviting place just to stay inside and stay."

35064759,488794309,2019-07-15,80331777,Kathleen P,Clean premises and comfortable beds.  Difficult to cook because too few utensils in kitchen.  Trash receptacles much too small.  Very under-lit with only one over head light per room so reading in bed not possible.

1094362,22502012,2014-11-08,7463994,Justine,I wanted to surprise my partner for his birthday with a night's stay in a place with a fancy jacuzzi but couldn't afford to pay the high prices of renting a hotel downtown so was very happy when I came across Lalo's listing. The apartment itself is simple and clean and just what it appears to be but the tub is really what makes it. I don't think you could find a heart shaped jacuzzi anywhere else in the city at such a reasonable price. Lalo was very kind and accommodating and even treated us to a bottle of wine for the occasion. Overall we had a very enjoyable and relaxing stay and would recommend Lalo's place to anyone in need of a good bath.  
15756712,158851737,2017-06-08,67370347,Victoria,Very clean. Small but we had everything we needed. Very good location.

7191482,158621394,2017-06-07,131839423,Mandy,We had a wonderful stay at Alex and Galina's place! It was a beautiful apartment with a great backyard space. It was exactly as pictured and the furniture was in great condition. The space was very clean and inviting. The neighbourhood is lovely and it was nice to escape the busy city but to be close everything when we needed it- we walked to great restaurants just a few blocks away! Having the parking space is handy. I would definitely recommend this place and will be returning to stay again in the future!

Terence provided helpful informations and was easy to contact at all time. We stayed in the apartment during the weekend so we had entire apartment space for us. We appreciated a lot the fitness room and the rooftop BBQ and relaxing space. The parking available in the garage was definitely a plus as well. We had a great time in Toronto.

L’appartement est très bien situé à deux pas du CN Tower et on peut visiter le centre ville à pied vraiment très pratique. Nous avons resté 3 nuits pendant le week-end du coup nous avons tout l’appartement pour nous. L’espace gym au 12e étage est super bien équipé le rooftop terrasse est juste magnifique. Le parking au sous-sol est un grand point fort pour ceux qui voyagent avec une voiture de location surtout dans une grande ville comme Toronto.Terence nous a fourni toutes les informations nécessaires pour notre séjour et il était toujours réactif et facile à joindre.

The guest bedroom and bathroom are absolutely beautiful and the entire condo is spotlessly clean! The apartment building is well-secured and has a nice gym - two very important factors for a busy working gal like me! The location is perfect: right across the street from a huge grocery store right next to the subway and walking distance to lots of awesome restaurants/shopping.
David is an impeccable host who makes you feel right at home. He was incredibly helpful when I was moving in and made several excellent recommendations for restaurants and shows. His attention to detail and warm personality were truly exceptional. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these accommodations to friends and family a fabulous stay! :)"
19081283,402764257,2019-01-19,26818923,Jessica,This apartment is in an amazing location nuzzled right in the middle of all the action - we walked everywhere and nothing was far away. Host is great - quick responses extremely flexible and plenty of information on the surrounding neighbourhood. Apartment is clean king bed is very comfortable shower pressure is good and place is comfortable for when you want to relax. Will definitely check to see if this apartment is available next time I visit Toronto!
24308865,464389875,2019-06-05,75751273,Fabian,Really lovely place! The room is spacious and a very decent price. It's a bit of a ways away from downtown but the King streetcar is right there. Lots of fun restaurants in the area and groceries just a couple of blocks away.

24578961,276718015,2018-06-14,147251010,Busola,Wow! Where do I start?!... Upon arrival Lucia welcomed us wonderfully into her beautiful home and even went out of her way to offer us food and drinks after a long day. This has been the best Airbnb I have ever been to. I can confidently say it was better than any hotel I could’ve stayed at. The location was perfect in a calm environment but also walking distance to the mall. She treated my mum and I like family and the house was so comfortable the bed bathroom everything was in perfect condition. I am highly impressed and she has just raised the standard for other bed and breakfasts out there. I will definitely be booking her whenever I come to the city. She is such a lovely lady with a great personality that you just wanna get to know! Thanks Lucia for everything.

He was always respectful friendly and tried to help me with my personal issues the best he could. (I was moving to Toronto and chose his Airbnb as primary stay).
He left fresh fruits cereal bars and water bottle everyday on the counter. I definitely recommend!"

It is also a beautiful house in a great location - ~20 min walk from the beach as well as a busy street with lots of shops and restaurants! Hilary had some great suggestions for places to visit (ask her about the bluffs!) and even offered a nice breakfast in the mornings.

I would definitely stay here again if I return to Toronto!"

The apartment is very spacious and has everything you need the bed was super comfortable and we really felt homey during our time spent here. 
The apartment is only a 15 minute walk from downtown so it is quite easy to get around a grocery store and some more shops are even closer. 
The parking space was great and it was good to leave the car there while getting to know the city by foot. 
We can definitely recommend spending time here and would come back should we ever travel to Toronto again in the future :)"

13270926,243112762,2018-03-14,171371919,Elissa,The airbnb was so nice I fell in love instantly! I stayed the night with a friend for a concert and it was more than perfect. We asked Odette if there was any way we could check in earlier than 4pm & she instantly responded saying she would have it ready for us by 2pm. There’s no onsite parking but I put the car on the street no problem. It was a little hard to find at first but it’s totally worth it! It’s also located beside a convenient store

3638933,58760766,2016-01-05,32805430,Joshua,It was a great experience.  There isn't really anything to improve.  Maybe an easier way to regulate the heater

The little touches to this place are what made our stay stand out. Randi had lots of plus clean towels nice sheets and even some essential oils diffusing to make it smell divine. I’d highly recommend this space great for a solo traveller or for couples."

10458594,363325459,2018-12-28,225480414,Anánír,"If you plan on exploring the city every day you’re there (or even for most of the time) this is the perfect place to be. There are a few options for public transit in the area all of which are within easy walking distance - at most 12 minutes away. The neighborhood in general is very quiet especially at night. It’s the environment best suited for those who want to wind down after a long day. 

The space is itself is neat compact and comfortable. It’s quite easy to cook there as well if you prefer to save money by not eating out so much. I also loved the small assortment of teas and the kettle. It really is the little things sometimes!"
21702224,345280993,2018-11-04,145829834,Mike,It was a good place to stay has a balcony
26127663,503271773,2019-08-05,162172129,Chrishel,Couldn’t ask for more! Great location fast responses great local tips not to mention the Airbnb was just beautiful and stylish.
11878962,111262803,2016-10-30,30542214,Andrea,I had a good stay at Elizabeth's apartment. The space felt homey which I like in an Air BnB. Everything was clean and the building was quiet. The bed was comfortable. The location was as expected; quite central and accessible to both U of T and Ryerson. I had some trouble getting in touch with Elizabeth on check in day but she was very apologetic - she was off on travels of her own! - so I would still rate the check in process as easy. I would stay here again - it is hard to find reliable safe and affordable accommodation in Toronto and this is a good find!
18447196,185767567,2017-08-22,146031250,Shelby,Lovely place close to everything! There's a parking lot right across the street and a balcony with a nice view!
34481366,567098224,2019-11-21,21645671,João Vitor,This is a great condo! It has all you need for a comfort stay. We were in party of 3 and there were absolutely no problems to report! Also the place is walking distance to important spots of the city.  I strongly recommend this unit!
18615582,270052745,2018-05-28,29988142,Andrew,Tristan was an such an accomodating host! The place was very clean and centerally located! Would recommend this Airbnb and would definitely stay here again!
30481490,425962252,2019-03-19,132192850,Andrew,This is a wonderful apartment at a great location. Good walking to most destinations but somewhat removed from the busiest streets. Jialun's Support Team was very clear and helpful with their communications and the apartment was clean and just as described. The only slight issue we ran into was trying to find the parking space within the garage as it was set up with multiple entrances and lacked signs as it assumed everyone knew how to get to their assigned spots. A quick diagram or description of how to find the spot would have been very helpful. Otherwise we had no other issues. We would definitely stay here again.
15207716,108568155,2016-10-16,22890942,Emelie,I had a really great stay at Erinne's place. She was a very friendly and accommodating host and made me feel welcome. The room was bright and spacious just like the picture with a closet and dresser for storing my things. The place is no more than a 5 minute walk to the Dufferin subway station and there are many options nearby to buy groceries including small shops and a large grocery store about 10 minutes away. Erinne made space for my things in the fridge she even has a mini fridge in the kitchen for guests and it was easy to cook in her kitchen. On top of everything the place was extremely clean. I would definitely recommend it!
11334127,63301677,2016-02-21,47627737,Ruby,Mark is a GREAT host. From the time of inquiry to the time of booking down to arrival he was very accomodating and flexible. His respones instantly to my questions which I truly appreciate. The place is conveniently located between and close to major streets of the West End few minutes of walk to hip bars and restaurants and shops. I booked his place mainly to be close to Kensington Market and he walked me to it too on his way as I was not too familiar with the area. As for the room it was cozy and had a nice vintage feel to it. Thanks again Mark! I enjoyed my stay.

14884481,190952749,2017-09-05,6001566,Lynsey,"First off the home is incredible. You are so comfortable the second you walk in and the back garden is a little oasis in the city. The bathroom is wonderful with all the amenities you need and the bed is comfortable. It was hard to get out an explore Toronto with such a beautiful home base. 
Tamara and Sean also left a gift card for coffee which was a nice touch. They were also very easy to communicate with as well. 

Location is very central to all the restaurants and areas we wanted to explore and the TTC is easy to use. 

Look forward to staying here again in the future!"
27460918,357207231,2018-12-09,273333,Farouk,Suzie’s Place was absolutely perfect for our stay in Toronto! The check in was easy and communication prior to arrival was excellent.

All in all a wonderful stay and we will definitely be back!

Everything we did was within walking distance including shops tour attractions restaurants and even entertainment. The place itself was really clean and a good size for my group that went. The view from the balcony was nice with the CN tower being visible. Excellent experience in Toronto along with a good host!

The place looks amazing and has a gorgeous view. Levan makes sure you have access to a  lot of little attentions like accès to Netflix  some breakfast items and wifi. He made sure I was checked in without any problems. Very good host
35973881,557275434,2019-10-31,53373037,Pat,Jidai has a GREAT place with lots of space not lots of living room seating but by pulling up dining room chairs there is plenty of room. The space is HUGE by Toronto standards. Jidai is very accomodating.
1382277,174644361,2017-07-26,37908174,Richard,"This is a fantastic place to stay if your in Toronto. The neighborhood is filled with great places to eat and drink and it is very accessible to downtown by foot streetcar or bus. We walked everywhere and loved being able to come back to this apartment to nap before going out for the evening. It is exactly like the pictures full of art and sunshine. 

Christina was/is a fantastic host with a few follow ups with us to make sure everything was going well. I would t hesitate to book again the next time we're in Toronto. "
9134591,328573737,2018-09-26,193415921,Paulo,ótima localização e preço mais baixo que os outros.
22467531,275283789,2018-06-10,14482230,Shauna,"My partner and I had a great long weekend stay. I was looking for a place that wasn't in the middle of downtown had wi-fi had parking (we drove into Toronto from the states) and self check-in (because we were planning on an evening arrival). While not downtown it was a relatively quick drive - usually about 10 minutes. It obviously could double that during peak traffic hours. Getting out of the driveway could be a bit tricky simply because of backing into traffic but we relied on Uber while in town so only had to worry about it the one time. 

It's not a huge place but the description says it's cozy and it is! Roomy bathroom it was a comfortable temperature (and Tammy checked in on that specifically which I appreciated) I appreciated having the small fridge for the few days as well ass access to Netflix etc. Perfect for a single person or a couple. (I know there is a futon that could fit two more but I would think it would feel a bit cramped then.) 

Tammy was incredibly responsive - I never had to wait! Though I did not have much I needed to contact her about except check-in and out. Check-in was easy. I don't mind meeting hosts for a key of course but self check-in is obviously easier for scheduling. I had a conference meeting Sunday morning and Tammy was flexible with the check-out time for me (noon instead of 11). 

A few blocks from the house there are a few blocks of little restaurants a pub a liquor store coffee shops and the like. We were so happy to find the area when we got in Thursday after a long drive. And the liquor store had a pretty nice local beer selection! 

Thanks for a great experience!"

18034823,234921993,2018-02-14,167073516,Tomi,I enjoyed my time at Bels place! Perfect for a first time Toronto visitor as it is close to the mall and transportation is pretty easy
6377437,168044737,2017-07-08,2260913,Russell,The apartment is well appointed and the beds are very comfy. AC units work well and Jose and company are attentive hosts. The neighborhood is hip interesting and fun. Easy access to downtown Chinatown etc via electric buses just around the corner.
14490119,517662767,2019-08-25,179865400,Nani,Clean place. Good location. Great hosts! I’d definitely recommend it.
27696699,465849993,2019-06-08,122629375,Phil,Great location although construction nearby when we stayed. Needs a little work on some aspects but adequate.
27980327,365753094,2019-01-01,147586063,Filipe,Amazing experience going to rebook for sure
20772929,535003774,2019-09-23,295862414,Ethan,This place was the definition of okay but at a good value. The place isn't upscale nor does it claim to be. Wouldn't recommend spending many nights here but for a one or two nights stay it seems worth it. In my experience a responsive host.
6774973,140219569,2017-03-28,9171449,Giulio,We had an amazing time in Sian apartment. Everything was perfect and comfortable. The position was awesome we walked for most of our visit in Toronto. 
2916008,25246764,2015-01-10,7225442,Rebecca,Monet was a wonderful host and very quick to respond to all communication and requests. Meeting up for the keys was effortless. The apartment is beautiful classy and comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone as it is central and well situated for any trip to Toronto. Extremely good value and an elegant treat for accommodation! Pool hot tub and sauna wonderful too!
22214254,358734408,2018-12-15,228583315,Barry,Eugenia is a wonderful host. She is prompt to answer email correspondence and very pleasant.  Her home is very clean centrally located & reasonably priced.
17971401,159779810,2017-06-11,77715705,Vince,Apartment located in the heart of Toronto. Breathtaking view. Very easy check-in. Jerry was very helpful and answered to all our questions promptly. 
13315168,169176968,2017-07-11,15830099,Stephanie,I am so happy to have stayed here during my first trip to Toronto. Douglas is a wonderful host. He made me feel welcome and comfortable as a guest in his warm home. The townhouse is clean and has a beautiful view of the downtown skyline. The location is great too. Easy access to public transportation and bike rental. I actually walked to most places and felt comfortable doing to day and night. Douglas gave me great suggestions on things to do and eat. I really had a great time and would book here again in the future.
14871622,415055527,2019-02-21,3609904,David,Great first impression upon entering the unit that remained throughout my stay. Palmerston Blvd is one of the most beautiful neighbourhood streets in the entire city and the apartment perfectly complimented the street narrative. The floor plan was top shelf. It is a well appointed and very comfortable. The kitchen is huge and the living space never felt cramped. Hyla seems to be a traveller herself and knows intuitively what travellers want (the Nespresso machine was a nice touch). Would return in a heartbeat!
19213481,179860152,2017-08-08,139875987,Kazuhito,"I could go to downtown by walk
And there is a station close to the house
Location is good

It was best place"

Merci beaucoup Olivia; nous recommandons vivement ton annonce à ceux qui veulent profiter de leur séjour torontois tout en étant en centre ville et en pouvant se reposer dans un appartement très confortable aux vues magnifiques ou Olivia fait tout pour que nous nous sentions comme chez nous.

14539935,181993943,2017-08-13,41658703,Michel,A very quiet place close to everything. Ming is a discrete and very nice host.
19085132,510837302,2019-08-16,30595483,Andrew,This is a comfortable compact apartment perfectly located to many amenities. Located on a quiet street just feet away from busy Yonge Street and Church Street this apartment makes for a terrific nest in the middle of the action.
32526278,486414824,2019-07-12,67588139,Eduardo,Everything OK !
7132329,305689321,2018-08-11,54032847,다슬,Nice place and great hosts. Very recommend!
29151068,517507821,2019-08-25,277227630,Jasmen,Sam's place was great! We were able to check in early and she gave us tips on how to get around. Everything was clean and comfortable! Her view was awesome and she was super easy to talk to. Hazel made the trip better too as we had to leave our dogs at home she let us cuddle her!
26754102,420411773,2019-03-06,224610325,Sandra,Peter’s apartment is exactly as pictured it’s in a great spot so close to CN Tower Ripleys Aquarium (which is awesome) Rogers Arena and The Rec Room - all a must close to a supermarket pharmacy. It’s very quiet being so close to the city and even next to the railway - you wouldn’t even know!! We would definitely stay here again.
3041017,32809727,2015-05-22,14189905,Emma,We loved Dean's place - it was spotless and beautifully decorated. The huge terrace and rooftop pool were great too! Incredible views and a good location. 
21561458,230605487,2018-01-28,8245637,Annie,"Lovely lovely stay! Great location really and the place is nicely decorated. The bed is also very comfortable. 
I have  a sensitive sleep it is a more noisy part of town and the curtains block partially the light... but my boyfriend sleep like a baby."
2906218,319497536,2018-09-06,38312946,Tanja,Perfekte Unterkunft um Toronto zu erkunden. Trotz der guten Lage ist es nachts ruhig und das Bett super bequem. Die Nachbarschaft ist bunt und interessant es gibt Essen aus aller Welt direkt um die Ecke. Marty hat alle Anfragen sofort beantwortet. Wir würden sofort wiederkommen.
24396723,468969012,2019-06-13,65837405,Geoffrey,This was my second stay at Maureen's place this time for a proper trip to Toronto instead of just an overnight layover. But it reaffirmed what I felt in my brief stay last time: Maureen is one of the rare hosts who gives you local experience and insight for your trip which is what Airbnb aims to do but is so hard to find these days. She gives great tips for exploring the city along with interesting stories and discussions over breakfast. The location is great for exploring anywhere along the TTC subway streetcar and bus lines. I actually shifted my trip dates by a day to be able to stay at Maureen's place and I don't regret it at all!
4311914,408094178,2019-02-03,168038141,Taliyah,Good for a family of 4 stylish comfortable super quiet only problem was parking during the winter on the side of the street I also seen a few tickets on some vehicles & was lucky to have paid for parking minutes away.
7774544,70138081,2016-04-16,27672890,Rachael,Vera was very quick to respond to my inquiry. All of the instructions were easy to follow and the place was nice and clean when we arrived. This location is walking distance to many sights and restaurants. I would recommend Vera's apartment to anyone visiting beautiful Toronto! 
21622250,213737017,2017-11-22,28051542,Thao,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8115809,90579508,2016-08-01,30546989,Tracey,Great location in the center of Kensington Market. A great home base if you want to immerse yourself in the culture and history or the market and nearby Chinatown. Easy to find and located on a small laneway. Fairly quiet. Cute room with a ceiling fan a small fridge and a counter to make coffee and tea and a small but modern and clean bathroom with a shower stall. It was perfect for our weekend away from the burbs!!!
742076,11658378,2014-04-11,8724163,Steffen,Catherine was a wonderful and very caring host. My Family stayed there for 10 days and enjoyed the stay very much. The appartment is cosy and clean the garden is just amazing...everytime again five stars ;-)

7107331,179379084,2017-08-07,72279869,Anika,Great house great value great location! Truly can't go wrong!
28520678,494045021,2019-07-23,62283267,Laura,A cosy place with very good location (good public transit connections). Comfortable room and easy check-in. Would definitely book again if going to Toronto.
22056356,260347903,2018-05-04,38620919,Jonathan,These guys have a nice place stay. We were attending a concert at Danforth Music Hall which this suite is a perfect location for. The suite was clean and the host communicated well. There was an issue with water supply but they had that dealt with very quickly and did not effect us in the slightest (Please note the water issue had nothing to do with the hosts but it all had to do with the city fixing a pipe and never turned their water back on.)    The only thing I wish they had were pods for their Nespresso machine. All in all it was a great stay.
6570775,556067089,2019-10-28,294171375,Jeffrey,The best host!
16894655,479097311,2019-06-30,104821128,Erica,Jess is a very easy-going host and the place itself was just as described - cozy and well equipped in a great location. You will have all the privacy you can ask for and it just feels like home!

18681182,488746153,2019-07-15,194122484,Lea,Our stay with Joanne and Jim was absolutely wonderful! There hospitality was incredible: When we first arrived they showed us the loft and we got a personal tour and explanation on pretty much everything (how the stove works which light switches to use first in the hallway etc). In the end they even showed us the supermarket next door and drove us there! The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful and the train station Mimico is just 10 minutes on foot away. The kitchen had everything one could possibly need to cook; all in all the house was just well equipped. There’s even a rain shower that we we’re very happy to have. The recommendations of the ice cream shop and the Indian Restaurant were great and we definitely made us of all the tipps they gave us. In conclusion we had an amazing time and would definitely recommend staying there!!
21186916,282552269,2018-06-27,46705720,Gary,Great location close to everything!
6927460,260654115,2018-05-04,177548002,Patricia,Lilia is a great host. Beautiful and comfortable studio. Perfect location to explore Annex and Downtown. Please do explore the neighborhood there are just countless of GREAT restaurants shops stores etc and it is just a bonus that it is beautiful. From Pearson International Airport when we arrived it was just crazy busy. To get to the studio if you want to go by uber  there are only current ones that is allowed to do airport pickups and more expensive. If you go to the help desk they can give you different cheaper options of transportation to get to The studio. The option we picked was the UP station to Bloor and had to get off to a different station for the final stop Bathurst  from there you can walk 6-10 minutes to the studio or taxi will cost 6 Canadian dollars if you prefer. For the station it cost about 20 Canadian dollars for two people. If you decide to use uber it cost me about 44 Canadian dollars on the way back. The studio is exactly like in the pictures. It was a very easy check in and very welcoming. If you decide to go to St Lawrence Market which is recommended take cash a lot of places there does not take credit cards. We definitely enjoyed our stay. Lots of thanks to you Lilia 
13064101,81592545,2016-06-24,78004015,Tim,Perfectly located apt in queens west. Ben was super quick to respond with any questions I had and his place is immaculate. Would DEFINITELY stay again next time I'm in Toronto. 
21716566,318389486,2018-09-03,210038892,Ben,Chez Nicky vous avez de la tranquillité. Il y a des bus pour aller au centre ville et il est possible de marcher pour aller à l'aéroport Pearson. Cependant nous n'avons pas trouvé le lieu propre.
28959048,449445238,2019-05-06,66628988,Sehar,We had such a great time at Brigida's place. The apartment is very clean stylish and welcoming! Brigida was ready to answer questions at any time gave awesome tips about the area and made the whole experience great!
29246443,503167460,2019-08-05,86157799,Rene,Sincerement Diane est la MEILLEURE Hôte. Elle est attentionnée serviable disponible et très gentille. Dès notre arrivée Diane était prête à nous accueillir et elle était toujours accessible tout au long de notre séjour. Le loft est spacieux et très bien positionné. Je vous recommande de reserver avec Diane!!
14387032,157355571,2017-06-03,29335628,David,Seema was an excellent host. Great attitude. The place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. Well kept clean and comfortable. As others have mentioned great bathroom. Nice area too close to the water.
1560504,7084842,2013-09-05,6713907,Assane,"I stayed with 6 friends of mine at Maria's house for a (long) week end. We were delighted by the beauty of the house it was tidy and really comfortable. Towels and sheets were available and the two beautifull bathrooms were really cool. 
Moreover the neighborhood is very nice ans really alive with plenty of cafés shops and restaurant. The house is also near downtown (Yonge St Dundas etc) just take the Tram for a 12-15 minutes ride.
Would come back there the next time i visit Toronto without any hesitation if available .
Thank you again Maria :)"
28952946,541595669,2019-10-05,274672173,Brandon,Greats stay close to lots of food and things to do. Very clean and the check in was super easy.  Fast responses from Sam and we’re friendly people to deal with. Would recommend
17285575,342842757,2018-10-29,215510581,Liam,Great spot exactly as advertised.
22907174,285359498,2018-07-03,43810885,Karen,D'Ammié made it easy for the self check in. She was very responsive. Location is close to highway so if you're driving this is great. 
37999190,523393259,2019-09-03,286765897,Ma,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
19439722,290560820,2018-07-14,34867118,Candace,This was our first AirBNB experience and our family really enjoyed the apartment! With 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 2 and 4) it was clean and spacious enough for us. My girls loved the glass enclosed bedroom and views from the windows! Having laundry in the unit and a bathtub was also super helpful. There’s a supermarket across the street which made it easy to run out for last minute snacks and items. We arranged for parking onsite which made it easy for us to drive to the Zoo and other sites but we mainly walked everywhere as the unit is centrally located. Lan was very responsive throughout our stay and quickly resolved an issue with our reserved spot when we arrived. We would definitely stay here again next time we come to Toronto!
8237869,97017058,2016-08-25,38295892,Luna,Phil was a great host. Place was clean and tidy. Left us some goodies too. I would definitely return. Lovely host!
6214925,265855266,2018-05-18,30558009,Koz,"Matt's place is exactly as described beautifully styled and very well maintained.  He has thought of every small detail to make your stay enjoyable and in return asks that you follow some common sense rules to preserve the great space provided. The unit is compact so probably best for one or two people to be most comfortable.

The view from the 45th floor is spectacular day or night and the building modern and comfortable. There is a fair bit of city noise like cars motorcycles and sirens that pop up now and then which should be fine for all but the particularly noise sensitive. 

Matt was a great host and very responsive when I had a slight problem locking the door at checkout.  Definitely recommend that you stay here!"
19403125,442085515,2019-04-22,183230269,Jawad,Nice place
25264127,314251570,2018-08-26,340336,Michael,"great stay the condo is nice clean excellent for the 4of us very close from CN tower or waterfront all the equipment you need is available parking included you just have to walk ;-)

34339797,493590409,2019-07-22,269524799,Aaron,Great host great location great value. Only complaint is how long the elevators take but there’s nothing the host can do about that. Would stay here again.
17331637,301136083,2018-08-03,152542300,Byung Joon,"Awesome host!!
Thank you so much!!!!!"
20590074,252891867,2018-04-12,116153027,Jashan,Exactly as described! Very convenient for my short stay of one night.

36481007,538250745,2019-09-29,251147805,Crystal,Everything we needed was there for our stay. Was a perfect place to lay our heads for the night.
5917524,507304234,2019-08-11,5305743,Aurelio,The unit is a very unique basement as half of it is above ground level which allows enough light to enter through the big window in the living room. Very convenient walk distance  to a major subway station on the Yonge line.
18686344,216350160,2017-12-03,6102806,Victor,Great stay! Thank you so much :)
12602468,228041813,2018-01-17,53969914,Kathleen,This Airbnb was a great location the bed was comfortable and the kitchen had everything necessary. The rest of the accommodations were ok nothing special but if you're not planning on spending any time in the unit adequate.  The extra charges were also not clearly listed (specifically as to the number of guests) so I would confirm all extra charges before actually booking.
10650849,168052746,2017-07-08,11653895,Marti,Aina's place is a good 10 minute walk to the subway station and roughly the same amount to a nice street full of shops and restaurants.  Less than that and you can find grocery stores.  The room itself is comfortable (although with an added mattress pad the futon bed could be all the more comfy).  One thing to remember: the shared bathroom is upstairs.  All in all though - a fantastic location friendly host and exceptional value!  Thank you Aina for a wonderful stay!  
19522757,189726424,2017-09-02,89128084,Mária,Everything was perfect. It is really nice and very clean room with bathroom. Bed was comfortable :) you can get there from the airport with public transport it only takes two buses and about 40 minutes. Communication with Marie&Eiram was great they made sure that I had everything what I needed.
10350830,165339456,2017-07-01,20419147,Christina,"Chris is a wonderful host! He was extremely responsive flexible with our schedules and a joy to be around. His home is gorgeous and the guest suite located in the newly renovated basement provided a homey feeling and gave us a sense of privacy. Chris' love for interior design is apparent from the moment you walk in - the house is modern und tastefully furnished. Very clean!

Chris’ home is (literally) around the corner from coffee shops bars restaurants cute shops and public transportation (it’s a 1 min walk to the bus/tram stop). The closest coffee shop “Sweat & Soda” is a 30 sec walk and became our go-to place in the mornings not just for their convenient location and modern/fun vibe but their friendly staff amazing lattes and food. If you go there you must try their oatmeal with berries - it’s the best! We even bought a bowl for the road.

Chris is fun and interesting to talk to and generously shared tips of things to see around the area. We would have loved to talk to him more but our stay was too short so we’re definitely going to have to plan another visit in the future!

15132324,190237996,2017-09-03,147833241,Mridhula,Tanka and Shibanee are very friendly hosts. They made sure that we get comfortable. Tanka helped us with getting around the place by giving all the information about the places around and how the public transporation works there. He even helped us get the tokens for the public transporation on our first day. Tanka offered breakfast to us. With Tanka and Shibanee we felt like we were at our relative's place. Would definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to visit Toronto.

16387194,471472550,2019-06-17,82459973,Laurin,"Ros is a super friendly host and makes sure that you feel comfortable at his place. He also has good advices for exploring the city!
You have your own room which you can lock the bed was comfy and the place is very quite while the location is still convenient to reach the city center.
The apartment is kind of in the basement so there is not that much daylight. However it´s a good place to stay for a few days and I can fully recommend it!"
2078597,426584029,2019-03-21,15196167,Sacha,Everything you think you might need they thought of it. Probably my favorite airbnb stay yet. Area is a little far from downtown but there plenty of great small shops restaurants and bars within walking distance.
13256555,105167367,2016-09-30,85559510,Manuel,Yas is an amazing host very patient with me (stayed with her for a month while searching for a permanent place closer to UofT) since before we met. My flight arrived late at night And I got to her place very early in the morning (like 5:30). She received me with a smile and comfortable room. The place is just like in the pictures and Yas keeps it tidy homely and cozy. Shadow is awesome (no other word to describe him). He always tries get into the fridge so be careful! Yas makes a very tasty chocolate cake and her boyfriend lend me a skateboard  for the time I lived with her. She also pointed me to several places (bars a tattoo parlour anything I needed). We had a couple of long conversations with beer about our cultural differences which enlightened me in several ways. Unfortunately my schedule at UofT kept me at the library till late at night missing the chance to see her most of the days. She was extremely patient and cool about it the whole time. An overall great first AirBnB experience.
37620363,556505513,2019-10-29,38483826,Laura,Andrew's place was clean comfortable and very well located. It was excellent for my business trip to Toronto.
15699861,136852520,2017-03-12,110559228,Jack,Awesome place really good value and location.
31758842,504951100,2019-08-08,170409602,Abz,"To start with the location is perfect for amenities walking distance to the CN tower and centre. It is distant enough to offer tranquility and peace that you would expect from a home. The apartment is very spacious beautifully designed and well equipped. We were a family of 13 and we had plenty of space in the bedrooms as well as the sofa bed converted beds which provided a great environment for the kids to have a ‘sleepover’. The television was  well sized to provide good entertainment. The dining table was a very good feature and the kitchen is very convenient and comfortable to work in. The balcony provides an excellent space for a breather and overall the apartment felt like a home away from home. 
The key collection and drop off was easy. The entrance to the building is very safe and secure and on street parking is free after 9pm to 8am and only £2 ( 3CaD) hr as we had a very large vehicle otherwise there is designated free parking for guests. We have decided we will book here in our future visits and already recommended to 2 more families visiting in the next few weeks."

16603527,461959885,2019-06-01,40069710,Matt,Wendy is such as great host and sweet lady. Value for your money is fair. If you need a bed and don't care about having a lot of space then this place is a great bang for your buck. Parking is not on site a 5 -minute walk to a parking lot. Not a big deal at all in the summer.

682099,8216509,2013-10-21,8726876,Leena,"I stayed with Jennifer for three nights during a recent training I attended and found her home to be spotless and comfortable. She was friendlyrelaxed and welcoming. I felt very much at home in her place and the location was fantastic. I walked here from the train station and did everything on foot for the three days I was here.
I would definitely stay with her again.  "
5116831,210880936,2017-11-11,129914779,Kristine,We really enjoyed our one night stay at Elizabeth’s place. The neighborhood was quaint with lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance. It was a 20 minute Uber ride to get downtown (CN Tower Eaton Center etc.) Elizabeth met us at checkin and the place was clean and ready upon arrival. I would definitely stay here again.
11100177,526898200,2019-09-09,61284617,David,Descent place for the price. Close to train station.

5822110,288761718,2018-07-10,22910292,Yuval,"The place was as described. Great location close to Dufferin subway and 29 bus. Nice outdoor area. Friendly trusting housemates.
I thought having one bathroom for 4 people might be an issue but it ended up being just fine. 
One issue was with the heat wave the place was extremely hot after a few days a better fan was arranged for my room and that helped a lot.
Thanks!

Oscar's response is so quick so there's no worries about the stay here.

In the neighborhood there are so many nice restaurants. In addition  due to the easy access to public transportation it's very easy to go downtown.

Everything is perfect. If given a chance I'd like to stay here again."

20094311,179496017,2017-08-07,42913209,Jazmin,Had a wonderful stay at Lydia's place. Our previous Airbnb had cancelled 3 days before our trip to Toronto so we were desperately in need of a place to stay but Lydia was more than happy to accept our request. Location was absolutely perfect literally just minutes away from the CN tower and Aquarium. Communication with Lydia was also very informative and she always made sure we were a priority. I had even forgotten my rain jacket inside the closet and I was already out of town but I was able to arrange for my friend to get the coat from Lydia on that same day. Thank you Lydia!!! Definitely will be looking to stay at Lydia's place next time we are in Toronto :)

19952855,333586508,2018-10-07,197430916,Yi,公共交通方便紧邻TTC房东也很热情｡但我需要提醒一下此房的窗正对马路隔音效果不好凌晨依然车来车往并且窗外200米有一条火车道是真的货运火车不是轻轨和地铁平均半小时一趟经过那个铁轨声音很有穿透力｡因此如果你睡眠质量不好可能需要注意｡

A short walk to the PATH through Air Canada Center or Union Station. Margo was very nice and greeted us on arrival to give us instructions and the parking spot. She also allowed us to check in a little earlier. We did not get a chance to check out the amenities like pool sauna gym etc. but hope to next time! Great stay overall and great host! Thanks for a wonderful first airbnb experience!

Rarely heard other tenant noise but can hear traffic and current construction beside building. That wouldn't deter me from staying here again though. Overall great place clean and easy checkin/out. Enjoyed use of the pool & sauna as well. I have now stayed in both of Katy's places and you can't go wrong. Highly recommend either of Katy's places.

21594220,223632749,2018-01-01,39332751,John,Quiet clean & stylish apartment located on Kings Street in the heart of downtown Toronto. I've stayed at different airbnbs in Toronto but nothing comes close to this one mainly because of location. There is a shopper's mart cafes liquor store restaurants & bars all within walking distance. Extremely convenient especially during Toronto winters when it's freezing outside. As for the apartment there are floor to ceiling windows throughout the apartment providing magnificent views of downtown Toronto. Clean & modern. The couch in the common room was super comfortable and spacious and I had no trouble sleeping there for three nights. The bed in the main bedroom can easily fit two adults and is very comfortable as well. The pull out couch/bed in the other room is a bit uncomfortable but not too bad. Wish we got to take advantage of the balcony but temps were below zero during our stay. Overall we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in during our trip. I'm really hoping this place will be available on my next visit to Toronto.
39061647,563972922,2019-11-14,264123051,Courtney,I found the host to be a bit rude but the other tenant was so sweet and the place was a cute stay.

15008251,114311518,2016-11-17,42210306,Fanny,Nice spacious room big window private bathroom is a plus :) The bed is quite hard which was fine and comfortable for us but maybe not for those who prefer a softer bed. Friendly and welcoming host helpful too! We would stay here again.

529189,1765801,2012-07-21,2462326,Christina,Caroline was extremely quick with communication and accommodating kind and easygoing. And her place is even cuter in person! The location is fantastic within easy walking distance to Dundas and Queen Street West where you'll find lots of galleries restaurants independent clothing retailers cafes bookstores and antiques. My husband and I would definitely stay here again.
18557039,233453634,2018-02-09,27425791,Samantha,Perfect area since it was easy to access the station and so many places to go and things to do within walking distance.

Would highly recommend!

39931024,570971781,2019-11-30,27017132,Tom,We really enjoyed our stay. Blake is a great host and his apartment is amazing. It's furnished very well and the indoor parking with lightning fast elevator was so convenient especially given the winter weather in Toronto. Among the top 10% of AirBnb stays we've experienced around the world! Highly recommend.
1100282,41142111,2015-08-04,37866290,Leah,This house is really cozy and well equipped. The neighbourhood is nice indeed especially for those who like riding the bike the location is perfect! Although I didn't get to know Sun the communication was really good and she left little notes and goodies in the house.

6777955,51916907,2015-10-25,9192951,Claire,I stayed in Andrea's apartment for 8 nights in October 2015 and found it ideal for my stay. It was ideally located only a 10-15 minute walk from the University of Toronto campus which was perfect for me as I was attending a conference there for a few days. The nearest subway station Spadina is only 5-10 minutes' walk away. Andrea arranged for me to pick the keys up on my arrival which went very smoothly. I met Andrea in person on the last day of my stay and she was very friendly and helpful. The apartment was well-equipped with bath and shower plenty of towels/toiletries etc. and utensils. The kitchenette has two cooker hob rings fridge kettle microwave and sink. Overall I had a great stay - thanks Andrea!

19568371,191220104,2017-09-06,14696370,Iulian,"Ken's place was exactly as advertised. It was clean and cosy. Everything was in the proper place freshly washed & dried towels and bed sheets. It was great. Kitchen had everything we needed and more. Bathroom as well.

Ken himself is attentive and  accommodating. We did not have a lot of contact and that is also great because we did not have to. We checked in by getting the keys from the Concierge downstairs (24 hours) went up and found everything in order. To the one question that we had Ken replied to really fast.

Overall great experience."

15204457,492827822,2019-07-21,133447985,Mary Anne,"Great place for one or two people with parking  and in a great location.  
Nice little kitchen with all that you need;  two bathrooms both with showers ; washer and dryer if you need it.       
Good location - grocery store across the street  Starbucks at the corner and streetcar out front.   Streetcar you can pay cash each time  or if riding it frequently get a Presto card from Shopper's Drug Mart just down the street (about a 5 min walk).   Presto card is much easier to use.
This is a great Airbnb when staying in Toronto.
Thank you Anton & Natalia"

19316355,261547117,2018-05-06,39021068,Surya,"In one sentence it was a great experience to live in this house!!

We were there for a little over 2 weeks and enjoyed our stay very much! Bill and Cindy were super responsive to all our questions and also very helpful.

With respect to the house it is a gem! I loved the sitting area right at the top and we used to spend some evenings just relaxing there. Everything is super clean and exactly how it is shown in the house description. 

With respect to connectivity both the bus and tram stops are a few minutes walking distance. By tram downtown is around 10-15 min ride. I had a 9year old with me who doesn't like to walk much (!) and there was no problem at all with accessibility of public transport. :)

For groceries there are two stores 5 minutes walk away and we did our shopping there for food. A laundromat is also within walking distance from their house.

We really enjoyed staying here and I would not hesitate to recommend this house to those who want to have some peace and quiet with their stay at the same time be close to downtown.

Finally I loved the coffee given by Bill and Cindy!"

1564999,41162561,2015-08-04,39694354,Eury,Samantha was absolutely amazing! We rented the house last minute and she was able to make things work out for us. She was an excellent host and was very welcoming. It was also our first time using air bnb so not many people were willing to rent to us on such a short notice but Sam made it very easy to work with her

5891703,41135634,2015-08-04,25475202,Xiaosha,"I stayed in Georgina's place for 8 days and it's a great experience to share the house with her and her family.

The public transportation was very convenient here for a only 8 minutes walking to the subway station. Many  stores and restaurants nearby including a 24 hours running grocery store. 

The host family was quite friendly and helpful. Georgina helped me with a lot local information in finding a great burger restaurant and the best beach in Toronto. She also helped me to figure out the route to another city by train. Georgina's husbands Anthony was very friendly as well during my stay. He deepened my understanding and experience of Canada by sharing  lots of local cultures and funny stories. Their son Johnson was home for only 2 days during my stay he is a lovely and smart kid who showed me the burger restaurant on iPad. The other two members are the cat Tux and The dog Luna from Mexico. They are lovely pets make my stay more like home and welcome.

If you like night life Georgina and Anthony can show you some bars nearby and the couple is talent in music performing. It's really fun to stay with them.

12556850,188211601,2017-08-28,72881641,Malina,"Perfect all around. The location could not be more ideal. Centrally located in Kensington Market but still very quiet when you're in the house. Elise & Ian are superb hosts. You're given a binder upon arrival with fun recommendations in neighborhoods nearby. I highly suggest ""Insomnia"" - best brunch by far and you can't beat $5 mimosas! Everything is within walking distance which is the best part. Elise was extremely flexible with check-in & check-out times which was very helpful with our stay. I cannot say enough how kind and helpful Elise was. You will not be disappointed with your decision to stay here! Will definitely come again :)"

La maison est située à l'est du centre ville de Toronto très bien desservie par des tramways (et bus) juste à l'angle de la rue ! Il y a des restos et un supermarché à quelques dizaines (centaines) de mètres. La salle de bain a côté de la chambre est  ""réservée"" aux hôtes. La maison est bien chauffée et calme. Samantha et sa famille sont très disponibles et réactifs (mails) toujours de très bons conseils pour organiser ma visite de Toronto ou trouver un restaurant sympathique. Ils réservent une place pour leurs hôtes dans le frigo sur les étagères etc. C'est tres agréable de faire partie de leur quotidien le temps du séjour ! Samantha m a même proposé de compléter sa lessive pour laver le peu de linge sale des quelques jours !!!"
27373715,362924155,2018-12-27,191899752,Christopher,We spent 6 days over Christmas in the apartment to visit friends and family and to enjoy the town. We chose the apartment due to the location and the nice pictures but in reality it is even much nicer. We had a marvelous time in Toronto and this is due to Toronto being a great city but mostly because of this place. We instantly felt at home and it was really difficult for us to say goodbye. The location and the view is stunning but also the interior of the apartment is extremely nice. We enjoyed every minute!
28360605,456836697,2019-05-22,195290380,Emma,Good view of the lake

23789275,342298756,2018-10-28,218517522,Rebecca,"This place could not have been in a better area. It was in the middle of the entertainment district with many places to park overnight close by.

Can’t complain about the cleanliness view or comfort... everything was just as described in the description and in the reviews.

The only thing is that the mattress wasn’t there for the 3rd and 4th guests. We weren’t able to sleep without it so thankfully our host brought it later on. Acquiring the mattress was a hassle though because communication was slow and we had to wait hours until it came so it delayed our plans for the night."

16901265,532319505,2019-09-19,461721,Bryna,Galina’s apartment was just as described and even better! I was coming home after a business trip and the location was close enough to the airport to make the commute an easy one. Check-in was quick and Galina was available to help at anytime. After a long flight and trip having a washer and dryer was so helpful. And the rain shower was a pleasant surprise! I also appreciated the chocolate and other food items. I would highly recommend staying with Galina.
9568534,253969167,2018-04-15,264896,Emma,Georgie was super lovely and welcoming. The room is as described and she provides little extra things that you don't normally expect like toiletries and bottled water. We were free to come and go as we pleased and this was very easy as the front door has a code. The individual rooms are also lockable by key if you want to be extra secure. The location is great close to transport and 5 min walk to Ossington St area where there are restaurants and bars. 5-10min tram ride to downtown or you can walk about 30min if the weather is nice. We would definitely stay again!
19485030,185769673,2017-08-22,146187231,Attique,It was my first time using AirBnb and Alex and Peter made it a good one. Would definitely recommend staying at their place as it was close to everything and was very clean.

1822789,265911937,2018-05-18,80279644,John,Suzanne’s place is awesome - the location is great for whatever you want to do in Toronto the streetcar is on your doorstep the apartment has everything you need to be comfortable for a short or long stay (and the neighborhood is full of cafes restaurants and grocery stores) and Suzanne and her husband are great hosts.  I stayed there for about 6 weeks after relocating to Toronto while looking for a long-term rental; Suzanne even helped me find a long-term place.

6812686,185394159,2017-08-21,2542127,Larry,"We had a great time at Rebecca's apartment. She was in communication with us several weeks before our trip with information about the apartment and things to do in Toronto. Her friend Edward checked us in and he was extremely helpful giving us directions to the apartment and even meeting us at the subway station to walk us to the complex. He was also flexible with our check out time as the next guests were arriving later in the day. Communications with both of them were easy and quick.

The apartment itself was just as described and very comfortable and clean. It is located slightly west of downtown Toronto but only about two blocks from the subway so we were easily able to easily get downtown. We also walked to the Junction which is about 15 minutes away and found many great places to eat.

I would stay with Rebecca again and recommend her apartment to anyone thinking about visiting Toronto."

12382195,287725188,2018-07-08,68876025,Konstanze,Great apt not far to the beach and also close to Downtown. We had everything we needed would definitely stay there again.

6273842,495777828,2019-07-26,184837965,Aline,"Overall the experience in David's place was okay. He answered all questions that I made really fast. The communication with him was good. The first impression of the place however was not good because of the stairs. His place is located on the upper floor of a house; therefore access to the apartment is made through stairs. We were aware of that fact about the stairs; however the stairs' appearance was not nice due to dirt and the number of steps to go upstairs is considerably numerous. My mother is 62 years old; therefore it was difficult for her to go upstairs constantly.  Also it is not easy to take the baggage upstairs. About cleanliness the table was barely cleaned. The dust was visible on the table. Also we were not certain about the cleanliness of the bedclothes. As a result I think that people who are used to stay in hotels may not feel entirely comfortable in David's place. My family and I expected a place carefully prepared to receive guests; however we did not have this feeling. For instance David asked us to wait after 3 pm to check in because of the cleaning that was late. The check-in was possible only at 3:30 pm.
The photos show comfort chairs at the rooftop patio but in reality they do not exist. Despite all those negative points the bedroom is large and comfortable and the rooftop patio is an asset to the place. The location is great near the subway and in front of a mall."

12605832,179455080,2017-08-07,29498001,Melanie,Ashley was amazing.  Her place was outstandingly convenient and clean.  She was an amazing host.  Beautiful home and it was enough space for 6 girls (we brought an air mattress).  She was even flexible with our check in dates! I would stay here again if I come to Toronto. Close to grocery stores restaurants and downtown.  We literally walked to Budweiser Stage and other nearby tourist places. The point is very close as well.  Niagara Falls was about an hr Drive which was perfect! Long story short.... great location beautiful views and Ashley was amazing! ❤️

It’s very close to Airport and 10 minutes drive.

Highly recommend this place.

22191164,437958046,2019-04-15,37937890,Anita,"I had a wonderful time staying at Zoe's place for my weekend visit. Her apartment is located very near the airport and also popular areas to visit including Chinatown and the entertainment district. The apartment itself is modern sparkling clean and has a great view of the city. 

My stay was made even better by Zoe's warm welcome and hospitality--she offered me plenty of fruit and even a plate of dumplings when she noticed that it was nearing lunchtime and I hadn't left the room for food yet! She also asked me multiple times to let her know if I needed anything and was very quick to respond to my messages. This was much appreciated when my evening flight home was cancelled last minute and I reached out to her to see if I could book another night with her. She said my safety was her top priority and to head over and that we could figure out details later. 

I will definitely choose to stay with Zoe again the next time I'm in town!"

14612719,114459807,2016-11-18,59092569,SeulKi,I visited michael's airbnb secondtime but different room this time. I really liked his house so i asked for one more night coz my room was in renovation. He was welcomed and very nice. Kitchen was clean and also bathroom was clean. This room was bigger than last time and i really enjoyed it! I would recommand this room. Good quality in good price. 
14451605,301159340,2018-08-03,148098530,Natasha,You will not be disappointed with Catherine & Nigel's place. Comfortable sleeping quarters and a private bathroom. We drove up from Wisconsin and arrived around 3am - so very late. Catherine was awake and ready to greet us upon our arrival super smooth check-in. We slept in until about 10am and when we awoke there was breakfast - coffee pastries and fresh fruit. The back yard was amazing if you get there early enough its a great space to have dinner and wine!!! 
14806985,128656425,2017-01-26,16683139,Jesse,I had a great stay. Will definitely check availability next time I'm in Toronto.
3554031,158177894,2017-06-05,21505144,Sally,Alessandra's place was just as pictured and described and she was very communicative when necessary. I had a great bday weekend!
14122952,233425175,2018-02-09,99170611,Xiaohan,Thank you Max for providing such hotel-level accomadation!
12243222,293086394,2018-07-19,17683485,Antoine,Excellente communication. Logement très agréable située à une vingtaine de minutes à pied du métro. Nombreux bus aux alentours. Quartier résidentiel.
28229838,518355399,2019-08-26,79055767,Hannah,"We stayed at this listing for 2 and a half weeks. If you want a completely independent experience then this is the place for you. If you are looking for warm interaction with local hosts then it isn't. You communicate with Airsorted not with the people who live in the main house (as this is a basement listing). We did run into Naomi and family at times but only had very short interactions. One of these included who I would assume is Naomi's husband instructing my boyfriend to keep the dehumidifier on at all times in the bathroom a civil but impersonal/cold reception. 

The place was nice and clean but it definitely looked bigger in the photos. It was perfectly adequate space for two people and we were able to hang out with some friends in the living area at times (most would just have to sit on the floor).

There is a cat scratching post at the top of the stairs that you descend down to get to the door. However there was absolutely no smell and the cat is very cuddly and friendly! It's quite a good hunter though. During our time there it killed two mice and a bird and we had the pleasure of seeing the carcasses on our way in (it was by the front lawn and backyard). However it wasn't too big of a deal and didn't contact Airsorted about it. It was eventually taken away.

Since it's a basement apartment you will hear noise from upstairs. But I think it's mostly their kid running around so it stops pretty early at night. I didn't find it too disruptive so I didn't find it necessary to contact the hosts about it. Don't be freaked out by some of the weird noises at night; it's probably the upstairs plumbing. You will hear it but won't wake you up from your sleep if you're not a light sleeper. Bring earplugs if you are one.

Bathroom kitchen and bedroom were all quite nice. We did have an issue with the towel rack slowly coming off the wall in the bathroom but it happened towards the end of our stay. Airsorted promptly responded when I contacted them about it but we were leaving soon so I didn't see the point of anyone coming in during our stay to fix it.

It's a nice location; not too far from downtown core good transport links and a quieter/trendy area that doesn't have as much of the hustle and bustle in the main city. 

All in all a fairly good stay."

22535859,449484789,2019-05-06,56390895,Jessica,"Stayed here for my first time in Toronto with a few friends - everyone in my group is an active traveler and avid user of Airbnb and we all thought this home was one of the more memorable and enjoyable homes we've stayed in through this platform.

The location is very walkable to a bustling area of bars and restaurants and Lyft/Uber are very convenient (~10-15 min drive from most other main attractions in Toronto). 

The home is clean and comfortably fit the 5 of us for the weekend. The parking was easy following Myles's instructions and Myles himself was very quick to respond to messages. All the amenities were thoughtfully provided so that we didn't have to give anything a second thought which is the best case scenario on a vacation!

The two balconies were a wonderful addition to our experience home to late night conversations and sunny breezy mornings with Tim Hortons. Overall a great place to stay that I would recommend to anyone. Hope to be back soon!"
38385739,546429150,2019-10-13,246681695,Andrew,By far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at! The location is perfect it is a 10 minute walk from the CN Tower and Aquarium Kensington Market Yonge Street the University of Toronto the Hockey Hall of Fame and the St. Lawrence Market. Bike rentals are located right outside of the front door to go anywhere farther.  There are several grocery and liquor stores within a 3 minute walk as well.  Egbert was super responsive and provided a clean tidy and cozy experience in Toronto. The house can comfortably sleep eight people.  The parking is provided by free by Egbert and is located right behind the house.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience or location!
5383881,75788188,2016-05-23,23788538,Yuchen,The suite is just at the heart of downtown Toronto. Pretty close to everything in walk distance. Beds are comfy and clean. Would stay here again if possible.
18805913,161831357,2017-06-18,7762495,Chaanse,"There are certain things in life that you need to see and experience for yourself because words can’t truly explain what you are seeing and witnessing. Gary’s condo falls into that category. It’s completely stunning. On the inside there is modern décor everywhere and it appears there isn’t a square foot of Gary’s condo that he didn’t put thought into. Gary’s condominium is equipped with almost every amenity imaginable. Its located in arguably the most desirable part of downtown Toronto with many great attractions nearby such as: Rogers stadium Cn tower and Much music. It’s short walking distance from Union Station which is amazing for those who fly into Pearson and spend the $12 to get from airport to Union Station. Hands down the most amazing part of Gary’s home is the terrace. During the day I did not to want leave the terrace. The views of the Cn tower and the rest of downtown are breathtaking. Gary has amazing furniture on the terrace that enables you to relax and appreciate every second you are there. The terrace is equipped with an amazing Sonos system that allows you to jam to your favorite music. I could ramble on and on about Gary’s place because it was simply amazing. Gary himself as a host was nothing short of amazing. Upon arrival the fridge was stacked with beers and treats. Throughout my whole stay Gary consistently made himself accessible and worked tirelessly to ensure that you had the best experience imaginable. 5 stars to  Gary and his hospitality. Needless to say I will definitely stay there again and I will go as far as saying I wont go to Toronto if I cant stay there.

27023329,425594745,2019-03-18,36902693,Deborah,Todd is very friendly efficient and helpful and checking into his place was easy and clear. The room is very clean and has nice linens and towels and long white curtains with a nice view out over trees and back yards. Todd provides nice toiletries too such as shampoo and conditioner. There’s no plug in the sink in the bathroom (it’s a cool designer sink tho!) so it can’t be filled for face washing if that’s something that’s part of your routine. The room is very small and simple with basic bedding a fridge and microwave and a small desk (apart from the bed) and is likely best for people just wanting a place to sleep - it is advertised as such. I could hear the people next door quite clearly and suggest future renters bring ear plugs.

The house treated us in a more welcoming way and it was quite and clean. Everything was just so perfect and we would love to come back each time we visit Toronto again. 
The house was also close to everything that we wanted to visit and transport is excellent for the same.
Talking about your kindness my words go immeasurable I very much appreciate and respect your truest version of being in letting me know after my arrival that you found my watch that I was thinking I lost it on the way. I cannot thank you enough on that- not only letting me know you also helped me reaching out. I’m so grateful to you on that.

I highly recommend anyone who visits Toronto to stay in a place where they find peace and people with principles and morals of life. 

Truthfully a combination of this in today’s world is rarely discoverable!"

The condo was small and the TV I wish had cable vs streaming.  All in all it fit the bill.  The parking was the bonus and the parking attendant was great.  He was a great help in parking of my rental car this made my trip easier.  Julie and the parking attendant were the bonuses of my stay here.

An easy commute into town in a nice area would definitely recommend.

5755168,213338468,2017-11-20,113696062,Ian,Had a long term stay that made me feel part of the family. Everyone was extremely accommodating and friendly. The Gym is well-equipped and the convenience of grocery shopping around the corner cannot be overstated. A great stay overall
19983243,332160409,2018-10-04,1480566,Ike,"Amazing location  at the far west side of Queen street Super close to everything. Grocery store that is literally next door lots of restaurants and bars around (this is the very cool Queen west after all) a Goodlife gym half a mile away that lets you do a free 2 week trial and about the same distance to BMO field if you're into Toronto FC games. 

Really loved the neighborhood and even better is the great bachelor pad apartment in a really cool/trendy building great view of the west side of the city that I came to like very much. Hyper fast wifi with cable and an amazing TV. Host went out of his way to let me extend my stay from one week to two. Just a few tiny gripes here and there (couch was a little tricky to get comfortable on there is no real lighting in the bedroom) but nothing that detracts from the awesomeness of this unit."

29130620,423557805,2019-03-14,109051394,Nora,Emma's place comes highly recommended for any sports fans and those who would want to see a game (Hockey Basketball or Baseball). All the stadiums are within walking distance just a heads up when the games end they shut down the street that Ubers use to pick you up. That was the only difficulty I encountered. The place was super clean the condo had great amenities and Emma was amazing at responding and her check-in process was really clear.

51616,189755053,2017-09-02,44937105,Jennifer,John's place is perfectly fine for a short stay. I found it strange there was only a duvet cover with no duvet in it on the bed. Don't know if I'm undervaluing the area but felt it was a little pricey for the accommodation.
732562,434784512,2019-04-08,253278328,Laura,Liz is so sweet! Her personality and how sweet she was made this stay really comfortable and made it worth every penny. I really enjoyed the bed and the gas fireplace and me and my boyfriend enjoyed using the pool table in the room when we were bored really nice place.

454927,6249487,2013-08-05,7379670,Josh,David is a wonderful host. As a first time AirBnB user I never felt a moment of skepticism. Extremely easy to book with and a wonderful and private room once you arrive. Great location which is close to all amenities and only a short cab ride from Billy Bishop. I will book again the next time I'm in Toronto!
13226219,287702286,2018-07-08,192864939,Ibrahim,"A friend and I came to Toronto for vacation. We were looking for a location with parking close to the city smoker firendly and etc. This Airbnb home is well worth the price and stay. The room was clean and the services the host provided for us was well more than enough. The backyard was a excellent hangout spot for when I was waiting for a Lyft ride or wanted to relax before a night of clubbing. Additionally the room and location has a security system ensuring our safety and our stuf which was a great bonus. The only thing I would want to mention is that the ceiling is low but not a bother. 

Overall this stay was amazing and relaxing with zero stress. I completely recommend anyone planning to stay here."

18819132,348020412,2018-11-12,122131087,Jessica,"I was disappointed with this experience. 

1. Host didn't answer when trying to buzz in. I had communicated that it would be a late check-in and she was okay with it but when we showed up she had already fallen asleep. I had to wait around for about an hour before someone else was nice enough to be our escort. There's security at the front and we were instructed not to talk to any staff which made it difficult to get inside. Incredibly stressful and frustrating. 

2. The condo was dirty not sure if it gets professionally cleaned. The kitchen/bedroom were dusty appliances were dirty shower curtain was dirty/looked like it was getting moldy and hadn't been washed in months and windows hadn't been wiped down. 

3. Toilet was broken so you had to mess with it every time if not it continuously made noise. Remote control wasn't working and I had to set up the cable/TV etc. which was a bit annoying. Not something you want to be doing when you're just trying to relax. 

Overall would not recommend this location unless they do some maintenance and upkeep. I will note that it's in a good location w/nice views."

37861725,517636317,2019-08-25,63927008,Marc,Had originally booked this unit for a convention however due to circumstances outside mine and the host’s control the unit was unavailable. He was quick to accommodate and placed us in a similar space. It was a nice stay
23632672,316111719,2018-08-30,77940587,Gustavo,Hi class accomodation. All clear complete. Stay with my family (4 persons) for 3 days. If come back to Toronto have no doubt in renting this space again.
6724677,162371750,2017-06-20,107069915,Freddy,"Very nice polite and considerate hosts. Really nice folks indeed!

Nevertheless compared to our past experiences the condo could be more ""Airbnb ready"": not the cleanest place (dirty laundry under the bed and no storage (drawers full of owners stuff oven full of pans). Seemed like it was not prepared to receive guests.

But again great hosts so im sure they will work on these points. "
17757256,360157976,2018-12-19,119305652,Zeila,I will be booking this again if I can. Perfect location the view is amazing the hot tub and pool were a highlight of my trip and Pooya was flexible with check-in/out times as well as able to answer any questions I had. I have stayed in several airbnb's and this was by far my favorite the quality of my stay for the price I paid is unmatched.
31597154,411748280,2019-02-13,12112412,Jeremy,Peter's place is as advertised; right across the street from the beach close to great restaurants and pubs on Queen E safe quiet and the space was super clean and comfortable.  Great host and nice place.

15701100,348079453,2018-11-12,51233006,Mitch,Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Toronto. In a great location which is within walking distance of downtown Toronto and a very stylish apartment with everything you would need. Checking in was easy and Lena & Dimitri were quick to respond to any questions.
36561747,507321240,2019-08-11,80138561,Erik,Great location. Apartment is well appointed. Modern and clean. Elevators get busy during peak times but that just an awareness thing then a detractor. I will stay here again for both business and pleasure.

19491509,506383129,2019-08-10,35573986,Hojjat,I would recommend this unit to travellers who seeking a great location in Toronto close to Stations and downtown. However is not a good place for those who have light sleep or easily annoyed by noise. Source of this noise isn’t from train station something I read earlier in comments but mostly from other guests living in the same building. James the co-host was quit cooperative nice and responded quickly whenever we called him.
36726248,511703263,2019-08-17,270953992,Marlene,It just a place to sleep

28511881,463620180,2019-06-03,8597113,Jean-Sebastien,Great location very responsive host clean room. Right under a bar though so a bit noisy on weekend nights but it didn't prevent me from being fast asleep after long days walking around the city.

6719639,101841024,2016-09-15,35284475,Cam,Chris' place was perfect for our visit to Toronto! An oasis from the hustle and bustle of Toronto that has everything to feel like home with an ensuite fridge bathroom and freestanding closet space! Chris' house rules were simple and we found everything we needed with ease from WiFi password to laundry facilities!

1016125,202304404,2017-10-10,21736023,Jessica,Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit bei Jaclyn - das Apartement ist in einer ruhigen Straße in einer belebten Gegend mit schönen Cafés und Bars. Unser Zimmer war sehr liebevoll hergerichtet und die Wohnung allgemein sehr gut ausgestattet. Schlüsselübergabe und Check-In liefen problemlos Jaclyn war zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht da und hatte aber für alles gesorgt und sich stets erkundigt wie es uns geht. Defintiv eine tolle Adresse in Toronto!
6290257,47128023,2015-09-15,37042895,Vita,"Me and wife have spent a wonderful three nights in Toronto much thanks to Clive and his place. Just hop on a tram next street and get downtown in 15 minutes or so where everything is walkable.

Now the place was among the best we have been to on our road trip. You have an entire down-floor separated apartment for yourself that is comfortable fully equipped and clean to give you the feel of your actual home after a whole day spent being a tourist. Clive even went out of his way when he let us park inside of his own garage during our stay and his wife was very welcoming on arrival offering drinks and a good conversation. Toronto is generally a very good city to 'airbnb' and Clive's place is to be recommended."

The view from the apartment is spectacular and it's very close to lots of bars restaurants and great attractions. Loved my stay and hope to stay here again
5151195,278091270,2018-06-17,11046531,Michael,This was ideal for my needs and a very lovely space. Fraser and Monique are warm and friendly hosts and I had everything I needed including a clean spacious private bathroom and a very cozy warm and tidy room and bed. I was in Toronto for a work trip and just needed somewhere clean and quiet to stay for two nights and this was an absolutely perfect option. 
30852975,519982943,2019-08-29,270822632,Stewart,"Fantastic location. Excellent hosts.
The apartment is in the basement as described and so gets very little natural light. The fridge was leaking which the hosts plan to have fixed. Otherwise everything you need is there. We are a family of 4 (2 young kids) and the kitchen / living space was sufficient for us.
Hosts very welcoming and responsive with great communication."
18912860,410632928,2019-02-10,21177036,Kenneth,Brilliant location close West Queen. There is a beautiful view of the CN Tower at night from out front. I almost want to keep this place a secret for myself but people have to know how great it is. Vincent is a wonderful host and is super quick on communication. He's very helpful with things like sorting out parking permits with the city. The space is great for small groups of 2 or 3 and is very cozy. If you see this place available for your trip don't miss out!
25719877,452025913,2019-05-12,235085612,Alex,It was great
9864534,409043437,2019-02-06,34274633,Marco,The apartment and the location are great. It was helpful that I was able to leave my suitcase on the day of my departure until 3 p.m. The only minus was the very thin duvet. As the bed stands next to a poorly isolated window front my first night was freezing even with the heat turned up. The next day Oliver made a warm duvet available and the problem was solved.

14587132,130950317,2017-02-09,111399685,Lorna,"Wonderful location for access to public transport and hence all of the wonders of Toronto.
A comfortable bed excellent heating and loads of hot water for showers.
Easy to find and we were met with the keys as we arrived.
No duvet on the bed just two very thin fleece blankets and only one bath towel [two hand towels] for two of us but we managed."

Only thing was parking was kind of a pain as there was not a guaranteed spot (it was first come first serve). But great stay overall!
24380460,294092537,2018-07-21,27355130,Cory,This was a good place.  The owner was very quick to message me back when I had questions and her place was very clean.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  
29684893,482490183,2019-07-06,173441869,Akilah,Great location and easy for walking around downtown including some nice restaurant choices nearby and a grocery store. Not far of a drive to other great tourist sites. Make sure to follow exact entry instructions to avoid any unnecessary confusion.
12932745,514170800,2019-08-20,29491092,Anja,The apartment was good located only a few steps away from St. Lawrence Market. Communicating with Lina was easy.

26572152,444859468,2019-04-28,21526769,Shari,The condo is very clean and well located just two blocks away from St. Lawrence market. There is a 24 hour Metro across the street and numerous public parking lots in the vicinity. The furnishings are quite basic but tasteful.  It was a comfortable budget conscious spot to stay while we moved our daughters into their new apartments.

Her apartment is a great little place really good location near transportation and stores. The airbnb has everything you need; kitchen-stuff towels clothes hangers etc. Cosy home which I was able to make my own. Only con is the squeaky floorboards it is an old house so it can't be helped! 

Overall I had a brilliant time staying here in Toronto thank you Catherine!"

Thanks Jay"
23231795,273309885,2018-06-05,1603594,Adrian,"Richard's place feels like a home away from home. It's a nice change of living from all of the condo rentals that you generally can rent. 

The location is super convenient. There will be some noise but that's sort of par for anything near King. On the top floor where the bedrooms I didn't really have any issues. "

39413711,560386777,2019-11-06,155446590,Shandalyn,Easy check-in low price & good  location. Couldn't access pool  & amenities as key fob didn't work for this door.  The large glass coffee table & having no kitchen seating (only 1 computer chair) was not convenient with having 2  kids with us.
20458367,567092265,2019-11-21,304408364,Bob,Tracy's B & B was well located in an attractive neighbourhood with an easy walk to transit. There is parking available. Nice amenities were provided in the comfortable suite and the host very welcoming and responsive. Nice kitchen.

They are very kind and helpful. They are quick to answer all of my questions and gave a lot of place recommendation to visit in Toronto. Me and my family had a blast staying here.

And the apartment is beyond our expectations. It is very clean wide array of amenities and the unit location is superb! Tristan and Ashley's place is definitely recommended and i would definitely stay here again! Thank you Tristan and Ashley :)"
19977818,208670213,2017-11-02,3003094,Toral,"Esther's place is located on a quiet street and very close to Keele subway station which makes getting around a breeze.  High Park is close by and groceries and the drugstore are too.  There's a Tim Horton's at the top of the street too!  My parents stayed here for about 6 weeks and enjoyed their visit.

The unit itself is beautiful with a good sized bedroom and a super comfy bed.  The bathroom's quite big too.  The kitchen is well appointed and has a coffee maker blender kettle microwave and French press.  There's a full sized refrigerator too.  Added bonus: full-sized washer and dryer right in the unit!

Esther was totally on top of communication and was a real joy to interact with! She made sure my mum and dad were well stocked with toilet paper paper towels and laundry detergent.  

A couple of things to be mindful of - as with all basement units it is often colder than the main floor.  Esther provided space heaters and a dehumidifier which came in very handy!  Furthermore if you're a light sleeper you'll likely hear the folks upstairs so bear that in mind.

Thank you for your hospitality Esther!"
34389494,509543673,2019-08-14,5240410,Ben,"Great location easy to find everything near by and subway on your doorstep. Louis was a great host who responded to my messages within a fast manner.

Spectacular views of the CN Tower Rogers Centre and downtown Toronto. 

A couple of negatives but not enough to put you off your trip;
Bed's are a little on the small side being double's and not the comfiest could also do with some curtains as the blinds make a lot of noise when the AC is on too with rattling. The Second room is closed off by glass doors with no privacy so bear that in mind when staying with other couples. 

The elevator is very slow and very busy often queues forming out of the hallway but this isn't the hosts fault more of a flaw with the building itself."
27458995,553612436,2019-10-24,170598792,Julia,We really enjoyed our stay. We were four and had enough space. The view is amazing: trees buildings CN tower Ontario lake...

8687873,50413142,2015-10-11,450918,Ashley,Phenomenal experience!! It's quite rare when the photos actually don't do justice for the space but Mary's home was even better than we had anticipated. The condo was spotless and cozy when we arrived and the keys and parking were seamlessly organized to make for an easy arrival. The view was amazing of the beautiful marina and park - which we enjoyed every morning as we sat on the comfy patio chairs with Starbucks coffee (conveniently located across the street). Not only was the condo experience great with the amazing location of being right downtown (easy walk to skydome CN tower great restaurants and bars) but Mary made this trip exceptional too. My boyfriend and I booked the day before our arrival and she was very responsive and accommodating. She made great recommendations and was extremely considerate. I have already told my friends and family about this gem and will definitely be booking another stay at her home in the future. I highly recommend staying here for a special Toronto experience!

1589014,311083948,2018-08-20,1154603,Stephen,Angela's place in the West End is great! It's centrally located and a well equipped comfortable place to rest your head while exploring the City.  Communication with Angela was clear and prompt.  I will definitely consider staying at Angela's again.
17367704,138323496,2017-03-19,33509367,Kartik,"Suzanne was a wonderful host who had everything we needed in the apartment. She checked us in very nicely and her apartment had an amazing view of the city!! My friends and I were visiting Toronto and had a great stay here. Would definitely recommend! 

Thanks Suzanne!"
23189004,236110164,2018-02-18,173275951,Jack,"We decided to take a short last minute vacation in downtown Toronto and found Ben's place.
In one word excellent. Ben was easy to deal with responsive and quick to please.
LOCATION: The condo building is right between the ACC and Rogers Center. It was a great spot to be. We were able to walk the waterfront visit the auto show at the convention center enjoy local restaurants even visit Casa Loma (via TTC subway next door at Union Station) all by walking.
There was a large Longo's grocery store right across the road from the building (on York Street) as well as an LCBO.
FACILITY. The condo building is very easy to drive to and get into; we did not have the hassle of obtaining entry keys like other places we've been at. The condo has everything we needed for our stay and the description was accurate. There's a parking spot that comes with the condo. That was important to us and we find the issue of parking is neglected on many Airbnb listings but not here.
The bed was firm clean and comfortable; shower/bathroom clean and pleasant to use.
We didn't use the building amenities like pool or fitness room.
We'd book again with Ben in a heartbeat."

25892420,434366027,2019-04-07,99548584,Christopher,"We so enjoyed our stay at Tom’s place! In his description he explains that the space has a 98 walk score and he was not kidding. It’s right next to an amazing craft coffee shop within 5 minutes of numerous excellent restaurants and a VERY short walk from the Eaton Centre which is basically the retail hub of Toronto. 

The place was very clean and tidy—you can tell Tom is an experienced host. Parking really wasn’t too difficult thankfully and the location was close enough to everything that we just left our car in the lot the whole weekend. The neighborhood is definitely a popular area for people in their 20s... it is not a quiet building and Tom’s place is right by the elevator but as long as that doesn’t bother you the many pros easily outweigh the very few cons. 

Overall we’re really glad we stayed at Tom’s place and would definitely recommend to others!"
22527912,417903320,2019-02-28,52695884,Yuri,The condo is exactly as advertised - beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. Hosts respond immediately and check in process is remarkably painless. Would stay again for sure.
4415635,346670432,2018-11-09,1561507,Ciara,Really good location! Right off Queen streetwith access to everything from restaurants to cute shops and the street car. Probably better for a shorter stay I was there for quite a long one for work. Good amenities and lots of space though.
12515733,267408414,2018-05-21,2143649,David,Great space in a great location. Clean and comfortable. Kayla was a great host and we look forward to staying here again the next time we're in Toronto. 
24122140,260641976,2018-05-04,127133125,Heart,Thank you so much we really enjoyed our time here. House is clean spacious stylish and comfortable. Ania/Eva made sure we got the directions to their place right- and though we got delayed Eva waited for us and greeted us with a big warm smile... The house has a heater which kept us warm throughout the days we stayed.  A quiet and peaceful community which is about 10-15min walk to the grocery and restaurants. Eva was so kind and concerned and kept in touch with us and made sure we are fine while making sure we had our privacy. They provided bedsheets towels and toiletries. They also have nice cozy furniture and a big spacious fridge plus microwave toaster and stove for cooking and heating for convenience. The coffee was great as well as the aromatherapy essential oils which made our room fragrant and relaxing! We surely enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy their stay away from the busy city life while enjoying the conveniences it offers. The neighborhood was also friendly and quiet. Would love to stay again next time! Thank you so much again for your kind hospitality! :) See you next time!
30246782,490410244,2019-07-18,80592838,Michel,Internet was not working for 11 days off my stay was communicated that an AC will be installed on a day when I staying and nothing happened it was just an unnecessary disturbance
6463230,40291119,2015-07-29,37743023,Brian,Place is in a great location close to the beach and very assessible to downtown toronto. Mike was a great host and goes out of his way to make sure you have everything you need. Would not hesitate to book again.
17319601,174643382,2017-07-26,67183493,Isabel,The place was exactly as presented in the pictures (even a little bit larger than expected). We fit comfortably 3 people (2 on the double bed and one on the sofa). However if you are planning to bring a third person bring sheets and blanket as those are not provided (also note that the sofa is not pull out). The apartment was super well equipped with a large closet to hang your clothes vaccuum iron and board shampoo and soap in the shower. The 3 large towels provided were great too! Check-in and check-out couldn't be easier the key is in a lock box on the door. No extra communication with Brenda was needed as everything was super straightforward. The apartment was really modern and well-lit the AC and ceiling fan were definitely a plus. The only slight minor I would mention is that the mirrors are all hung up pretty high up so if you're short like me it's hard to see yourself in them. I would also note even though this is visible on a map that the apartment is not right downtown you need to take an approx. 20 minute bus ride to get to the city center. However the bus stop is literally at the front door and is a straight shot to the center and it passes very frequently (and late at night! took it home at 2am on a weekday). Thanks Brenda for a great stay!

790887,273600562,2018-06-06,144117106,Ali,I had a blast in Toronto! Robert is an amazing host and his place is in a very great location. When I travel I like a combination of relaxation nightlife tourism and seeing the city through the eyes of a local. I was able to do all of these things and I will definitely book with Robert on my next visit to Toronto!
5959077,121379722,2016-12-16,389297,Jonathan,Nice place with a great view. Linens and pillows aren't so great but that's really the only complaint for what's otherwise a very nice place. 
23321474,319499825,2018-09-06,57951963,Natalie,Elaine’s place was very clean and stocked full of all necessities & all amenities you’d need. She was incredibly easy to get ahold of and answered every question/inquiry I had promptly. We really enjoyed this space!

Her view from the Balcony of the CN tower is amazing. I spent a lot of time in her awesome hammock the looks right at the tower.  The apartment is surrounded by tons of restaurants and bars. I travel a 365 days a year and this by far was one of my favorite Airbnb spots. If you don’t mind sharing a spot with an awesome host then this is the place for you."
12207883,86378658,2016-07-16,65833544,Marian,I really enjoyed my trip to Toronto and as well as Diana's place. She made sure we got settled in with all of the stuff we needed to know about the building but her place was full of pet hair; from the floor to the bedsheets to the curtains. She also didn't have any cleaning supplies so we as guests weren't able to sweep the floor before we checked out... But other than that she is VERY flexible with the schedules and it was a very friendly environment!
29411935,529322979,2019-09-14,118079666,Jonathan,One of the best Airbnb apartments I have stayed in. Perfect for couples or solo travellers. The apartment is close to the city centre and has great transport links. Very close to a 24 hour grocery store so you will have access to anything you may need during your stay.
37255826,559126990,2019-11-03,105166675,Christina,What a wonderful place. The apartment was spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable. Camila provided us with local tips to great places to eat. The go is walking distance and lots of parking on the road for a big truck. Highly highly recommend
14266137,413986230,2019-02-18,7294938,Priscillia & Julien,We liked our stay at Rodney's place. It is very convenient as it close from Lansdowne station supermarket and some restaurants. The room itself is nice with a view on the street. At our arrival we did not meet Rodney but everything was explained so we didn't have any issue (the door of the home and the room opens from an electronic door lock). Overall a nice and cheap place to stay in Toronto !

10788954,240860441,2018-03-06,9675439,Daniel,Die Wohnung liegt im zweiten Stock per Treppe erreichbar und war super sauber gut ausgestattet und sehr gemütlich. Vor allem der Gaskamin sorgt an kalten Tagen für viel Entspannung. Bars und Resaturants sind um die Ecke auf Queen und Kingstreet leicht zu erreichen. Der etwas kreativere working class meets gentrification Bezirk Leslieville ist nur einen Katzenprung entfernt und bietet fürs Ausgehen viel Angebot. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten gibt es in Corkville auch aber ein großer Supermarkt ist ca. 15 min entfernt. Pinoo ist eine sehr zuvorkommende und herzliche Gastgeberin die schnell erreichbar ist und bei Fragen immer gerne weiter hilft. Ich kann das Apartment nur weiter empfehlen.

1162890,99360810,2016-09-04,2761845,Ambjörn & Anne,"We had a perfect stay Tracy and Kate made us feel very welcome. We had our own entrance a small fridge and enjoyed to be able to make our own breakfast or sandwich in between. My husband is 6""3 and for him the ceiling in the bedroom was too low to stand up but Tracy mentioned it beforehand and it was really no problem. In the bathroom kitchen/living area it is higher.  The location was absolutely great with a brilliant coffee shop nearby a wonderful Neapolitan restaurant in walking distance and great access to the city.  We would definitely visit again!"
15500719,553613241,2019-10-24,2317848,Robert,Clarence’s home is the perfect place for anyone visiting Toronto. It’s on a quiet beautiful street in walking distance to many of the areas great restaurants and bars. The inside was spotless and the bed was a delight!

Meeting them was a real treat for us. I would strongly recommend their place to anyone who plans a visit in Toronto.

The kitchen was well stocked and the supermarket on the corner made it very easy to make meals in the home. The space even had toddler-friendly dinnerware which I found to be a great touch.  Would definitely stay here again on future visits.
28369220,348620579,2018-11-14,124077095,Holly,The view cleanliness and communication made my trip to Toronto a much more pleasant one! I highly recommend staying here and would love to come back!

7801902,135860656,2017-03-06,5161465,Robert,Alexandra's is a perfect place to stay in Toronto. We drove into town parked in the underground garage and walked everywhere we wanted to go. Location location location. The apartment itself is clean and comfortable...much nicer than a hotel room. Check-in (and out) and access to the parking was very efficient. And Alexandra answered all inquires promptly. We will be back!

13532029,193708881,2017-09-14,122075605,Nancy,Excellent location for baseball or hockey games. Excellent views if you're not afraid of heights. Small & VERY clean.

666670,5893068,2013-07-21,7239521,Barb,We stayed in Toronto for four nights for our sons wedding. I think they were four of the hottest days that Toronto has had. The A/C at Nick's place was up to the task The space was perfect for my husband and I. The washer and dryer were right outside the door which was very convenient. Bus stopped a few feet from our door and the subway and street cars were just a few blocks away.  From there you can go anywhere!!  Any time we contacted Nick he responded immediately and was very helpful. I would definitely recommend his place to others.
27641230,563376150,2019-11-12,39536146,Tiffany,Our family of 5 stayed here for a few days in November. The location was great close to union station and the PATH. Being close to the PATH was really nice especially when it was freezing cold and snowing outside. The view the from the bedrooms was the highlight of our stay. One bedroom had the lake view while the other one was right next to CN tower. Although space was on the smaller side the apartment had everything we needed. We’d stay here again next time we visit!

27985087,336568072,2018-10-14,5079204,Paula,Our stay at Meghan's condo was terrific. The location was ideal for our night. It is a quick ride or short walk to Queen West Liberty Village etc. The decor is very nice and there were extra little personal touches to make our stay even more comfortable. The balcony and parking were nice bonuses. Meghan was very quick to respond when we had some trouble getting into the parking garage and she resolved the issue immediately.  She is an excellent host.  The building is quiet and clean and the bed was very comfortable. We look forward to staying again some time. All in all it was a wonderful experience.

Quiet neighborhood that's walking distant to several restaurants that might be considered as ""hole in the wall"" but served GOOD food nonetheless. Subway transportation is also easily accessible. Wyn is a great host that gave us space but was VERY prompt with helpful tips (thanks for the parking app tip!  ). I will DEFINITELY recommend. I will be back."
33463627,446063041,2019-04-30,278064,Nilesh,I had the pleasure of staying in Kristen's lovely loft. The place was clean and well kept with great beds up and down. Internet was superfast and great collection of artwork to see and tea to drink. It is also very close to the train  downtown but also the area has great restaurants and unique bars to just hang out in.  Thanks for hosting and I highly recommend you stay here if available

31165405,542706909,2019-10-06,295571827,文武宝贝,入住折腾了有点久房东很nice的解释但停车还是折腾了半小时才搞定(主要是钥匙不显眼)｡位置是很棒的去机场几分钟开车就到很适合赶早班晚班机的而且住在机场附近并不会太吵但是卫生情况至少是第一观感完全对不起这个清洁费｡另外扛着行李爬上楼梯是蛮艰难的门口又窄扛行李的时候真的蛮困难的｡如果还有的选肯定不会选这里了｡

18548770,235393368,2018-02-16,9004165,Scott,Fantastic location - it doesn't get much better for downtown Toronto than Bay and Dundas.  And to have underground parking below the building included?  This is a rare amenity.  Building is very upscale and super secure.  Check-in instructions from hosts were thorough and complete.  Communication with hosts was fantastic - maybe the best we've ever experienced.  Studio is small but efficient.  Very quiet.  We definitely would stay again.

18648081,534279141,2019-09-22,6691539,Aqui,"We had booked Kris’s unit for my family to stay in Toronto (first time visitors) for a wedding and I have to say they were more than impressed. 

The location is amazing the amenities clean and new and the views (from the unit and the poolside) were stunning. 

I cannot stress enough on how convenient this place is if one intends to tour downtown. I had my elderly Mom with them and she was able to go around just fine  accessibility is good for those who might need it. 

The rooms themselves are exactly what we needed there is one master one guest and two pull out sofa beds. If you are a big group this is an extremely good value for money. We had the opportune moment of having a parking spot available for us at this time so it also helped us tremendously in saving on parking costs.

Lastly Check-in and check-out was seamless Kris was very responsive to us and was very accommodating. We couldn’t ask for anything more. 

Overall my family’s stay was memorable and had a positive experience and I highly attribute it to booking a nice and convenient location that is this place highly recommend this for other travelers and we would definitely be here again when we get the chance!"

Close to entertainment venues and numerous restaurants"
9077488,296753849,2018-07-26,45646823,Ahmad,Place has a convenient location but otherwise it is not a perfect place to stay at in the summer. It is extremly hot and humid (especially if you turn on the dryer) with the lack of ventilation or air conditioning. Also the host could try and be a bit more friendly/hospitable especially when a Telecom Engineer offers free help to fix the WiFi that was extremely unstable for most of the stay and was only fixed a few days before I left and after making several requests. Moroever 2 rolls of toilet paper 4 washing pods 1/4th of a bottle of dish soap and hand soap  are not  enough for someone staying for a full month and replenishing them does not cost $60 :)... Thanks for the stay anyhow.

Frank nos ofreció su ayuda desde el primer momento para recibir las maletas cuando el servicio de mensajería pasara por el apartamento y así nosotros pudiésemos visitar mientras tanto la ciudad. 

Además el apartamento está genial. Cómodo limpio tranquilo y con todos los servicios que queríamos. Muy recomendable."

The apartment is above the garage door but we did not notice noise from this. The view is of the apartment across the street but just outside there is a beautiful park and walkway along the water. If you are bothered by lights when sleeping I would recommend bringing a sleeping mask."

29703394,471442395,2019-06-17,3479938,Daniel,This place is a good location and was well priced. However it was not cleaned properly from the previous stay. There was still things on carpet the whole place needed hoovering and kitchen/bathroom were not well cleaned. Kabir was easy to communicate with but I found it surprising that he encouraged us not to tell anyone we were from Air BnB. It made us think Air BnB were not allowed at this condo.

37370241,515911480,2019-08-23,31152205,Kristina,"Thorough and tough to do review: So Toucan's place is frankly: AMAZING! And I imagine over time this review will become obsolete as I think it's a new Airbnb - but the Location is just perfect to be in The heart of Toronto - right in Yonge-dunde square on top of a subway station and the theatre. Anything you need right there. The value (for me) was fantastic - I bet the price climbs when the construction ends but still totally worth it. But yes: It's currently under construction so it's hard to find in scaffolding next to the the theatre across from Hendricks. Getting the key is through ""Keycafe"" 5+ minutes away in a 7-11 and there were no parking instructions for us - we learned we should've parked right across the street in the Eaton Centre it was cheaper than where we found using the app: HonkMobile (also an option but didn't show Eaton - so we paid $42 for 2 nights instead of $30 or less at Eaton. The Shower/water doesn't get very hot. There wasn't a TV or any patio furniture. I am a stickler for cleanliness and it's new! So it was pretty clean! But I recommended he have his cleaners be just a little more detailed. Nespresso machine was awesome! Also some light snacks were provided which always helps travelers! Gluten free even! Bring your own coffee fixings. Could use some hand towels and beach towels. Also checkout - you gotta make it back to the key-cafe so plan that walk/accordingly. Overall I'd definitely recommend it exactly as I experienced - if it's a deal! the view itself is worth it plus - I bet - Toucan's reply here will eventually say there is patio furniture a TV construction is done and extra towels are left in closets :)

21579229,308554797,2018-08-16,75465395,Prabhsimran,Pls be aware of what’s been shown and what you get! We booked the room and after booking we were told that we have to go to a different location than what is mentioned in the listing. The room of poorly ventilated and very suffocating and the shower wasn’t very clean. The check out was at 12pm and we were almost ready to go and informed and we need 10-15 mins more but we got very rude behaviour from the host to leave immediately at 12:15. The host entered the room the forced us to keep the door open till we go out. 
25892689,295905079,2018-07-24,13789684,Fabio Masataka,Steven was very attentive caring and helpful. He struggled to meet us whenever we needed and he always asked if it was all right to know if we needed anything he could help. A space differential is that I had TV in the room with Netflix of the three other rooms I've been in Toronto by Airbng only Steven's room had this amenity in the room.

We needed a place close to Exhibition place and this was perfect. An easy walk (well if weren’t such a HOT week in Toronto even a super host can’t control that!) street car easy access to get anywhere  and short walk to waterfront. We appreciated all the amenities in the unit and the building. Bed was super comfy that’s a big win in our books!
Liz was kind to check with us part way during our stay and quick to answer when we had a couple of questions. Highly recommended."

2361733,17066418,2014-08-06,15552387,Jabir,Ted is a good host and I had a pleasant stay at his apartment. Breakfast was provided and when another guest was staying at the apartment Ted made pancakes with homemade maple syrup that was simply excellent! The bed was comfortable with fresh sheets provided and the bathroom was clean with a good water and shower pressure. Ted also provided enough clean towels and some basic toiletries. The one downside was that the wifi speed was pretty slow and on my last night when it rained it just wasn't working. All in all still a good and cheap space that I recommend.

The property was in good shape although the building is still well into construction. The building is primarily a young adult crowd. It was a nice place to come back to after a few days of downtown exploration.

Daphne and her family went above and beyond to make us comfortable especially with a 5 month old. The place is very stylish but also extremely comfortable. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the apartment.  All of the amentities we needed for a two week stay were provided. George was also so helpful and so responsive whenever we had an issue or a question. We would go back in a heartbeat if we ever need a place to stay again!

This was my second  Airbnb experience and I couldn't be more satisfied with it. Eugene is really an amazing human being and he has got a really great family! His daughter Vicky and his wife are truly great people. And I'll surely miss his son playing the piano so passionately every single day... That really lifted my spirit every time!

The house is in a great neighborhood and it is really beautiful and clean. I absolutely  loved the room I stayed in.  The kitchen is well-equipped  the bathroom is nice and tidy with all the essentials available the bed is comfortable and the backyard is lovely.

The memories in this home away from home have been really wonderful  Eugene his wife  and Vicky and  has been truly amazing and helpful...  Thanks you so very much Eugene for sharing your wonderful  home :-) May The Almighty bless you and your family with all the happiness of the world.

7177340,510849709,2019-08-16,125849693,Alex,Great neighbourhood though the next-door neighbours went out of their way to make us feel unwelcome. Sound carries clearly from the kitchen upstairs which can be an issue if you're a light sleeper. Kona is attentive to guests' needs and responds quickly to texts.
820177,327813570,2018-09-24,7890046,Russell,"Had a great stay at Vinita & Joe's place which is very comfortable clean & tidy and feels more spacious than the photos suggest. I'm around 5' 9""and the ceiling height wasn't an issue for me. Location is excellent for places to eat & drink on College St plus good transport connections. V&J also have lots of great recommendations & useful info for the immediate and wider city area - they've really thought of everything. Should any questions arise they're also very responsive. As they say in their description due to the basement location family activity in the house above is inevitably sometimes audible. It wasn't an issue for me at all but those for whom this might be a concern should take this into account when deciding to stay here. All in all I would highly recommend the place and look forward to the possibility of staying again in the future."

4922370,350520243,2018-11-19,7465391,Kate,Great location comfortable bed. Elaine and Greg were super friendly and hospitable and gave lots of recommendations and travel tips. Overall for the price and location this was a great place to stay however there are 4 airbnb rooms as well as the family who say there so there were lots of people around and a rather noisy atmosphere. If you are looking for somewhere quiet and relaxing or if you are a light sleeper this probably isn't the place for you.
14769025,200483250,2017-10-05,1370904,Janae,Geetha was a great host. Very responsive to questions. The place is quite small but very clean and the bed is very comfortable.
27632327,427010240,2019-03-22,72834021,Jenny,"Our stay here was short and sweet. We needed somewhere to stay for a 10 hour overnight layover and this was the perfect spot! My husband and I had a few hours of sleep between flights and our 1.5-year-old daughter got to rest from the moment we got there until the time we left. Just a quick and cheap uber ride to the airport this is the perfect location for travellers. Although we didn't get to fully enjoy all the amenities the ones we witnessed were outstanding! There were water bottles coffee etc. waiting for us to enjoy as well as a lovely living room area 2 bed rooms and a bathroom! The space had a very welcoming/homey feel which didn't make us feel like we were in a stuffy hotel room for a night dreading our next flight. (: 

Our evening flight was really delayed making us not arrive until almost midnight yet the hosts still came to greet us and answered any questions we had until everyone went to bed. Fedora is a great host with a beautiful home and truly shows care for her guests! Highly recommend staying here."

Inside was bright clean and spacious. The kitchen counter space was perfect for prepping food and laying out apps. Our bachelorette party of 5 girls enjoyed ourselves for the day/night we were there! And Jason was quick to respond and really nice. Even let us in early :)  Would recommend and would rent again!"
22808990,292284121,2018-07-17,57789163,Riko,"The place of Jason is great. It has been one of the best Airbnb experiences we had. The house is really clean an the interior is very nice. We were a group of 5 and it was more than enough space. 

The communication with Jason was excellent. He responded very quickly and offered us a lot of information. 

Parking for smaller cars is included. If you have a bigger car you can park just around the corner with a parking permit. Json set this up for us in advance so parking was very easy. 

Also the location is great. There are a lot of good restaurants nearby. You can easily walk to Chinatown and Downtown in around 30-40 minutes. But there‘s also a bus stop close by. 

We really enjoyed our stay and can highly recommend this place!"

17570994,142092042,2017-04-06,8653056,James,Ashwin is a terrific host communicative clear and concise instructions for access to the flat and information about the local area. The flat itself is immaculate. Although the house itself is older the flat is very modern and comfortable. Location is great for access to Riverdale Leslieville Riverside Distillery District the Danforth and downtown. Plenty of restaurants within a short walk. There are some very nice touches too including coffee and breakfast food items for guest use. They've thought of everything. Great shower and good sized bathroom. Very comfy couch (which is also a sofa bed). The WiFi is very good and there's plenty of space for work if you are traveling on business. Parking off street at the rear just off a lane-way - not at all hard to find. 
12712286,162139075,2017-06-19,24743241,Aaron,This is a great apartment in an interesting part of town. Communication was great and I appreciated the check-in flexibility. Highly recommended.

18339045,303027300,2018-08-06,42950491,Marc,Lots of room to stretch out and relax during our one day stay.   Valerie was super responsive to queries.   Since we had two cars we had to park the second car overnight in a neighbouring street not too far away.   All had a good time.
29338921,414398517,2019-02-19,165919565,Joseph,Ahmed is a great host. He was quick to respond and gave great tips for the city and his place. The view from Ahmed's place is incredible to say the least.

She is really helpful and flexible according to your lifestyle. The place is not in downtown but accessible to all places by bus. Its very close to the Toronto airport. It’s a nice place if you need your privacy. Without any hesitation I would recommend this place to everyone.

Also the home is not newly renovated as advertised"

24869794,418619121,2019-03-02,232315777,Ella,It’s a generally a basic place everything is falling apart like handles but if your girls and going in winter. Don’t forget a change of shoes. There was a strip of thick ice. I struggled to get into and out of the house.

21751619,566153702,2019-11-18,304903019,Norman,Nice staying there
17776638,158842463,2017-06-08,122679937,Tim,It is non accessible for elderly or people that are physically limited because it is on the third floor without accessible elevators. The place is nice and quiet therefore not a place for noise. If you are visiting mainly to spend time in the city and only want a place to relax and sleep it is a good place to book. 
12007590,73158960,2016-05-07,63633293,Han,"James was really nice and sociable. He knows the area well so it was helpful to get recommendations about places to visit. The room was fairly large and clean with a queen sized bed so the stay was really nice. 
주인분이 정말 착하셧고 토론토 방문하는동안 많은 도움을 받을 수 있었습니다. 방과 침대가 생각보다 커서 머무는 동안 매우 편리했습니다. 주인분이 한국어와 영어를 둘다 쓰실줄 아셔서 의사소통하는데 편했습니다."
16261274,158844904,2017-06-08,27178076,Patrick,Ali's place is awesome. The location is perfect especially if you are attending a conference at the Sheraton Centre... it's 1.5 blocks away. I had a small issue during checkin getting the keys but Ali resolved it immediately. Overall excellent experience.

15803435,509486100,2019-08-14,76931374,Jonice,Dimitri was an awesome host! His condo is in a great location very close to an amazing mall and easy to get to the downtown area from. The apartment was super clean and felt so welcoming with the colors of the paint and the artwork and decor of the apartment. The amenities were also a fun added extra. Communication was great and whenever I had a question he responded within minutes. I’d definitely stay here again my next visit to Toronto!
22123822,450863359,2019-05-10,183013575,Martin,A great place to stay while visiting Toronto!
37209281,542694999,2019-10-06,229111729,Tiana,The place is exactly as seen in photos. Super clean and spacious. David was nice enough to let us check out an hour later than we were supposed to and the check in process was super easy. No complaints at all I would recommend for anyone to stay here!
33705430,488059102,2019-07-14,46872852,Aaron,At a great price close to fun parts of Toronto this apartment was a great landing pad for a weekend away. Jon was timely with his responses flexible with check-in and check-out times as communicated and quick to recommend a couple of local spots to grab some coffee. The apartment was immaculate and polished--exactly as described online. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
13738928,497451308,2019-07-28,53609658,Sonya,This place is in a perfect location and very comfortable for 3.  It has great amenities and even a kitchen included.  Would stay again!
25017925,481821595,2019-07-05,64674835,Connie,Was only here for a night and it was the perfect stay. Easy directions/straight forward. It was clean inside and exactly what the listing stated. It was in an amazing location. Owner was very fast to respond and we got to check in early when we were just going to drop off our luggage.
12343435,107478379,2016-10-10,39245795,Keifer,Our stay in Toronto was absolutely amazing! What made it even better was our Airbnb for the trip. It was modern really clean & a beautiful view of the city. We attended a concert and a Blue Jays game which was a 2 minute walk from the condo to the stadium. Overall one of the best vacations we have been on. We definitely recommend this place for a getaway to Toronto. 
26744163,552846998,2019-10-22,247317000,Jeongsoo,Public tran. Is very good~
6185463,152041479,2017-05-14,101487145,Kathleen,Cozy compact and well located this inner city cottage is a lovely space from which to explore Toronto. The studio space is very bright illuminated by many floor height windows French doors and a skylight. 
9651151,131546785,2017-02-12,6770161,Natasha,"I had a wonderful stay at Harry's place. He was a terrific host - warm welcoming and accommodating. I really enjoyed getting to know him over breakfast! 

The room was just perfect: beautifully furnished with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in fully equipped with towels some toiletries a heater and a fan TV with Netflix and with a charming courtyard outside. His place is located on a quiet street but is just steps away from the action. Check out the St. Lawrence Market that's just around the corner!

I'd highly recommend Harry's and will definitely be staying there again the next time I'm in Toronto."
8226634,66326869,2016-03-21,41426094,Shajicaa,Janet was a great host. The place was very beautiful clean and super cozy!  It looks exactly as seen in the pictures posted. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to others.

6239007,48697431,2015-09-28,38528738,Chanwen,Jennifer's home is so lovely and can hold about 4 adults.The room is very clean and could let you do some cooking with full kicthen. Also the great location makes us can go everywhere by foot! By the way Jennifer is a wonderful host and with quick reponse.I will definitely recommend my friends to stay here!
15743072,430446745,2019-03-30,246167695,Richard,Worth it. Thanks to Rika and Frankie.
11324869,468963419,2019-06-13,1878420,Eliana,Perfect place to stay! We can not wait to be back!
30376686,412083992,2019-02-14,15898113,Monica And Randy,"Gorgeous space on the top corner unit you'll feel like a celeb with a penthouse suite while not paying like you are.

The location is safe and great the walk to the grocery store which is not far also passes a number of restaurants and quick eateries even a convenience store.

The fob takes a little getting used to: you'll have to point it at a little black glass under the entry area system and again in the elevator to register your floor.

Very clean and comfortable. It was super windy while I was there around Snowmageddon 2019 and being on the top floor there were some creaking noises from the roof which couldn't be helped but they didn't interrupt my sleep.

The washer/dryer are in-unit so this is a great space for an extended stay."
27521631,502389190,2019-08-04,182071337,Kasha,Steph and Melissa were incredibly kind and helpful accommodating my last -minute travel hiccups and quick to respond whenever I reached out. Their space is absolutely beautiful and full of anything I might have needed. I only wish I could stay longer and will look forward to doing so next time.
17960571,186126349,2017-08-23,28201299,Hayley,"A brilliant stay at a convenient and quiet location. Clean modern easy to check in and out well equipped kitchen nice little backyard comfy beds great hot shower and great Wi-Fi. 

If I had to bring up any down sides it would only be that there is no laundry available to use and there is a total of 8 rooms for rent in this house so it can be quite busy."
18613334,434792915,2019-04-08,18764251,Brytany,Amazing location wonderful hosts!
6973000,512835740,2019-08-18,124162563,Cherie,Cozy place!
10526539,194010536,2017-09-15,148076774,Kaja,Jay jas an amazing view on Toronto's downtown. His flat is cozy and I would definitely recommend staying in his area when visiting Toronto
9651151,284986438,2018-07-02,169699479,Rachel,Harry was a fantastic host me and my partner really enjoyed our stay. Room was lovely great privacy and harry was such a ‘superhost’. 10/10
26531557,303058738,2018-08-06,139119616,Bryana,Iqra was a great hostess. She responded quickly and was able to help me several times during my trip. It’s walking distance to stores and a quick ride to downtown (King Street). I was disappointed by the showers water pressure the cleanliness of the common areas and that I wasn’t able to use the balcony because it’s covered in spiders. This location is high up so if you’re afraid of heights or hate waiting for the elevator take that into consideration but the views from condo are worth it!!!  Also note that the condo is in a prime location so you will hear sirens all night (and your neighbors conversation—walls are super thin.)  However the pros of this place definitely outweighs the cons. Overall I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely consider staying again.
15609733,544201549,2019-10-09,104176678,Roger,All details were well explained. Very easy check-in/out with good parking and access. Unit was clean and fancy loved the place and location!
22035300,420123569,2019-03-05,101875312,Steven,"A seamless overnight!

A thoughtful attentive host that responded quickly. 

Even adjusted the temperature remotely to ensure comfortable stay!"

7091024,449389264,2019-05-06,245768075,Arnout,Deb was a great host with a nice room located near the subway. However it was also located above a bar so it is really noisy in the weekends. Nonetheless we had a nice stay!
15903030,282876593,2018-06-28,612239,Bertrand,Great location quiet and very convenient. Efficient communication thank you.
19403125,302384385,2018-08-05,14166264,Shannon,Mary's place was great for what we needed although if you are taller than 6ft. you may have to watch you head a bit. Otherwise great stay!
13988682,191482921,2017-09-07,123109159,Marie,"Such a fantastic house our first Airbnb experience & it has set the benchmark very high we will never stay in a hotel ever again!

The host was totally flexible with our (very late) check-in & check-out times the amenities provided were well above expectations but so well received. We really appreciated the extra attention to detail especially with the baby items provided for our daughter including highchair baby gate pack 'n' play toys etc - the selection of bathroom items the house manual the guest snack basket & the food in the fridge was great... if we had have forgotten anything we would have been well sorted!

The house itself was beautiful lots of character great furniture well appointed and everything was just as described in the detailed listing.

Access to the property was easy & having a car park out the back for our rental car was great.

Our stay at Susan's house after a LONG flight from New Zealand made the first half of our trip so pleasant that we didn't want to leave & we would definitely like stay again one day when we come back to beautiful Canada!"
17905708,150317448,2017-05-07,125105492,Kyle,Wonderful place to stay! Very cozy!
2329180,62623103,2016-02-15,29868469,Wissam,It was easy to communicate with Frank. Room was ready when we arrived. The location of the room was really convenient because the subway was across the street. been to Toronto 3 times this was probably best location as everything can be traveled cheap on subway. I would recommend anyone this room. 
12072829,322227090,2018-09-12,169377304,Ken,Classy and comfortable and in an excellent location.  Large enough for our entire family to enjoy Toronto and area and still enjoy being together when home.  Well maintained and clean we could settle in and feel at home right away.  FIVE STARS !
1550882,37308994,2015-07-06,32084121,Daniel,Alvaro's place was very nice! It was complete with lots of kitchen appliances and a lovely welcome with fruits and farm-grown eggs! His father was extremely nice receiving us and always cordial!
23625662,336667249,2018-10-14,40074240,Hyeji,"Bad location. Too far from the Finch station not to mention from the downtown of Toronto. about 15-20mins walk away from the station. Bad public transportation access from the airport. 
Not entirely Korean-welcoming airbnb but it's closer to a backpacker's or a guesthouse. Sharing one room with 2 other people was uncomfortable and sharing one bathroom between 2 different rooms was even more uncomfortable. There're two doors to one bathroom enterable from two rooms so had to lock up both doors to use it and unlock before leaving. 
Laundry is not available unless you stay here more than a week.
No TV or anything in the common area.
Again it's far from the nearest station and also from the downtown. Had to move to other airbnb before my stay was finished."
2319682,204749319,2017-10-19,107798408,Jeffrey,Great place.   Really reliable.
8566821,504929997,2019-08-08,244308832,Emily,Had a great stay!
19121165,224567815,2018-01-03,149067455,Penny,Spent two weeks over Christmas and New Year at Kim's place. Wonderful time warm and cosy even with a cold snowy winter. Would be uncomfortable for tall people being a basement flat but suited us down to the ground. Transport links are great with a bus stop outside the front door and the metro only 10 min walk. Kim is a perfect host always available but not intrusive at the same time. Nothing is ever too much for her.  Thank you Kim would certainly stay here again.
28368298,429995364,2019-03-29,28168884,Amanda,"Great experience! Coffee and tea was a nice touch and appreciated. Very clean nice area amazing view soft towels! Check in was easy to follow.

The only downside was that the bed wasn't super comfortable. Other than that everything was great."
5557092,83929708,2016-07-04,44355250,Lestari,It was Great... The house so nice and clean. The View Priceless. It so worth it! ❤️ it so much.

Well equipped and a lovely balcony.

10773960,350501708,2018-11-19,85179438,Sarah,80 Willcocks is beautifully designed making for a special experience staying in Jordan and Justin's home. From lighting fixtures to spacious rooms and lots of comfortable seating every detail is considered. The master bed is not only massive but provides a great night's sleep. The street is quiet and homey while in a central location the home is very clean and any questions receive immediate responses- it's clear why Jordan and Justin are Superhosts.
14673711,468904835,2019-06-13,4643343,Heike,grosses Zimmer  man kommt gut mit der U -Bahn in die Stadt  Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe
18161463,166130999,2017-07-02,8413495,Sonia,Can't say enough great things about Mehr and his place. He was a great host and very accommodating. Check in was easy and the condo is absolutely perfect. Close to everything easy access from the airport. Quick walk to hundreds of restaurants and shops. The view was outstanding. I would highly recommend this to everyone and would definitely stay here again.
14928597,446070438,2019-04-30,241697909,Andreas,Toller Ort mit spektakulärer Aussicht.
15148236,538356194,2019-09-29,57509293,Mirna,I stayed at John's place for a long stay (over six months) and everything was excellent.  Location cleaniness hospitality.  Room kitchen and bathroom had everything that I could possibly need.  I could always count on John answering any questions promptly.  He is a wonderful host because he's very respectful of your privacy but he's also available if you need something.  The house is located in a quiet neighborhood that is well connected to the subway and stores.  I could do everything either by walking or taking public transportation.  John has a dog that in my opinion makes his house even more appealing.  Didou is a very sweet and calm dog.  However if you don't like dogs there wouldn't be any problems because she stays in the upper level.  Finally I highly recommend John's place to anyone that is looking for a lovely clean and respectful house.  Before finding John's place I stayed at a few different places and by far John's house is absolutely the best!  I'm moving out of Toronto but if I ever need to go visit I will definitely stay at John's place.  Thanks John for being such a great host!
2843818,83576087,2016-07-03,65145629,Ran,It was a very awesome experience to stay with Paul and Jennifer. They are very friendly and so well prepared for the guests. From them you can learn a lot of must have local knowledge. We just felt so peaceful by knowing that they got our back. Their place is nice clean and quite yet so convenient. Very close to public transportation and close to the city. It is so easy to get anywhere. The front street is full of different restaurants where you can get any kind of food you like.

36234308,536840087,2019-09-27,11356494,Maximilian,We spend five days at Lawrence place. It was the perfect location to explore Toronto and places lake Niagara Falls or Bruce Peninsula. The private parking space is truly a big advantage! The Appartement was clean and Lawrence and Jacqueline great hosts. We can really recommend the place for your next trip to Toronto.

3315154,76022172,2016-05-24,687286,Stephanie,"We had a wonderful stay! Rob is the perfect host. We booked last minute and he was so quick to answer! The place is huge modern clean quiet. Super nice shower. Free parking.
The neighborhood is so charming. It's really convenient because it takes only 25min to walk downtown. We will definitely come back."
12151689,80028503,2016-06-15,6971256,Anna,A slice of luxury for a sliver of the price! Victoria's beautiful apartment is spacious comfy and has a breathtaking view of downtown Toronto. Located minutes from the subway with a grocery store and ample shopping nearby at the Eaton Centre there's nothing more you'd ever ask for. Victoria herself is a lovely and informative host who will answer your questions promptly and politely. Any trip to Toronto will greatly be enhanced by staying at this property.

23711260,434289819,2019-04-07,18096620,Katie,What a perfect spot! I was in town for a conference and this was the perfect refuge. It even somehow smelled like a spa when I arrived! The apartment is cozy very clean comfortable and easy to access. I deeply appreciated the consideration taken by Ashot: he made sure to check in both before I arrived and during there was everything I wanted/needed available in the apartment and the Airbnb manual had great suggestions for where to go and eat. I LOVED Queen st right near the apartment and had some of my best food of the trip while staying locally. I highly recommend!

8666401,69869108,2016-04-14,23394069,Rick,"Jenn's apartment had a nice private entrance so I never felt I was intruding on her family. The neighbourhood was safe and the BnB was only a half block from Bloor Street with its endless array of trendy bars shops coffee shops and restaurants. 

Jenn and I communicated easily via text messaging and she gave me clear instructions on how to pick up the key since she was not available when i arrived.

I will definitley stay at Jenn's place if it is available the next time I am in Toronto.

15272252,134257919,2017-02-26,33263183,Sepehr,"Nedo's place is wonderful and in a very cool location. I stayed here for a month when moving back to Toronto and found the place to have everything I needed. The place is very well designed and has a great bathroom with an excellent shower. Nedo himself is very nice and will help with whatever you may need.

Highly recommend staying here for a quick visit to Toronto very close to main public transit stations."
17404153,140925590,2017-04-01,3761231,Alisha,Alessandra's home was very inviting and clean!! I was so impressed! She even left Chocolate on the bed and i felt so special :)! Sadly some personal matters came up and i had to leave one day early in a rush but my first night was nice! Not as private as id hoped but private enough! Im very appreciative! And id defiantly book another time! 
30793099,470708642,2019-06-16,115389055,Jennifer,Great location perfect spot on a busy and lively part of town. Host was very helpful in providing restaurant suggestions.
6268539,129162176,2017-01-29,113137598,Jessica,Amazing location with an incredible view and very comfortable accommodations.  Our host was delightful. We were there with our 6 year old while our house was being renovated and we were still going to work and school.  M. provided everything we needed. She responded right away and went beyond expectations to make our stay easy and relaxing. The building has a beautiful pool hot tub gym and change room with sauna steam and showers. We didn't have time to enjoy much of that but would love to return just for pleasure!
22278502,496518582,2019-07-27,167478312,Xin,Luis is a very kind and amicable host.  He gave us very clear instructions of how to use facilities in the house. Although the house is shared with the host's family we were given an independent room with enough personal space and no need to worry about privacy. The house is clean and tidy and well located only 10 minutes walk to Runnymede Subway Station which is surrounded by lots of restaurants and convenient stores and easy to go to Pearson Airport and Downtown Toronto.  Bus network is also well developed nearby. We spent a wonderful week here and felt quiet satisfied.
14151336,174044164,2017-07-24,134674455,Hadi,"I stayed in this apartment for a few weeks during June/July (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Here is the summary of my experience:

Cons:
-The main problem of this property is neighbor's noise. The ceiling which separates this unit from above unit is wooden material without any proper insulation (let alone acoustical). Whenever someone walks on above floor (which could happen after midnight when you are asleep) you would hear loud squeaky noise waking you up. I guess this is more related to the poor construction quality rather than inconsideration of the neighbors!
-The bathroom's access is through a hallway which is common to other tenants. So there is no privacy between the room and bathroom.

Pros:
-The host is responding very quickly to queries before and after booking.
-Great location.
-Internet speed is good.
-TV local channels are alright. However a few channels are pixelated. The cable guy needs to pay a visit.
-TTC bus stops (lines (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ) are within walking distance.
-Beautiful backyard is accessible through sliding door.
-The room is equipped with both Central and local Air Conditioner.
-Kitchen equipment are adequate for simple cooking."

16938170,414702222,2019-02-20,99123739,Noelle,Highly recommend Sandra's listing. The room and shared public spaces were even better than shown in photos.

25737684,491673861,2019-07-20,42335013,Janet,My daughters and I were so very pleased to have stayed at Margarette's place.  If I could give more than five stars I would.  Where do I begin?  Wonderful helpful responsive friendly host.  Super helpful in giving tips on what to do with my kids.  I really appreciate cleanliness and this place was super clean.  The location is great.  A short walk coffee shop bakery and subway.  There are also frequent buses close by.  The space was modern and stylish.  Toronto was experiencing a heat wave and the host made sure the temperature was cool enough in the suite.   Highly recommend this Airbnb.

37624237,561485191,2019-11-09,274278760,Jacob,We could not be happier with our stay! Location was amazing as was the quiet and friendly building. Perfect spot for a Leafs or Jay's game and steps away from Union Station makes this place a no-brainer! Appliances and fixtures were basic but complete and having laundry in the apartment was a lifesaver. Thanks Matt!
18707109,194021979,2017-09-15,1073633,Meliza,Perfectly located in the middle of it all. Spacious apartment with everything that you need included. Very clean nice patio. Will look to stay again next time around.
5825038,194310769,2017-09-16,58763103,Naomi,Really nice hosts and a great neighbourhood of beautiful old homes as well as many quality restaurants.  I enjoyed not being in the downtown core.  The bed was comfy house was clean and breakfast was more than adequate.
7022166,233024798,2018-02-07,159377374,Matthew,"My stay with Natalie and Luke was great! They are both very friendly and sociable and know Toronto very well. They will help you figure out where to go what to see or even just sit down for a chat. That being said they know how to respect privacy as well.

I stayed with Natalie and Luke for 3 weeks and had absolutely no issues. The entire experience was great and I would encourage anyone to stay with them."

14980600,364390730,2018-12-30,158732931,Angelo,David was very polite helpful and accommodating. We absolutely recommend staying with David and Negar if you plan on traveling to Toronto.
15115210,562393621,2019-11-10,26986915,Arooj,It was a nice stay. The room was clean and there were amenities in the washroom too. Kitchen was not too clean but other than that there wasn't any issue.
15798296,357974005,2018-12-12,200938149,Fan Ping,Matt was a great host. This was my first time using AirBnb and I was booking for a friend visiting from the US too. It worked out well and the location was really close. Any questions he responded quickly.
1631386,215255884,2017-11-28,33691445,Stephanie,I would definitely stay here again. The location is perfect right by the metro station. The neighbourhood is nice. The check in was very easy. The hosts were not present when I arrived but the electronic lock made it very simple. The room is a little cold but there are enough blankets to sleep like a baby! The bed is very comfortable.
25295091,539009414,2019-09-30,277625516,Jenny,Iva’s apartment was exactly as advertised it was very clean spacious and close to great amenities!

1631386,289514461,2018-07-12,41822084,Henk Jan,Great place. Great location. Would definitely recommend this
13845515,291803949,2018-07-16,105158376,Chris,A nice little place to stay! Even though it's in the middle of Wallace Emerson it seems private and quiet. Really close to  bus lines and the Galleria mall or the galleries that are along Dupont (the main reason I was staying here). It's a good place to set up a base of operations for exploring the city.
9977642,318353514,2018-09-03,121475233,Lisa,"The apartment was clean and in a great location. He bed was comfortable and we had everything we could have needed 
Jamil provided a great list of food and drink recommendations and was very quick to respond to any inquiry 
We even had homemade cookies left for us to snack on 
Will definitely be booking again on our next trip to Toronto"
7141416,146789206,2017-04-23,4233262,Kristina,You can't get much better location than Stephanie's flat! If you're looking to truly be in the centre of everything this is the place for you! There's also a grocery store conveniently located a few steps away...very helpful! Stephanie also went above and beyond to help me out. When she found out I was gluten free she brought a clean toaster for me to use so it wouldn't cross contaminate. Not very many hosts would do that! Only thing I recommend to anyone staying at Stephanie's flat. If you're a light sleeper or don't want to be up at the crack of dawn bring some eye covers because the curtain on the windows does nothing to keep the sun out in the morning. Other than that fantastic space fantastic location Stephanie is sweet and communicative I recommend! 
13661927,297356287,2018-07-27,204090684,Jennifer,We enjoyed our stay at Sunny's place. It was clean and spacious. We also had a good check-in and check-out experience.  One thing to note is that the washroom and kitchen/dining area were on a different floor than the living space.  I did appreciate that he provided a coffee maker coffee and a couple kinds of tea. 
16437307,123295096,2016-12-28,107005010,Josh,Great and fantastic would do it again
15531372,445519148,2019-04-29,25914259,Rin,The house was renovated  recently.  And really quiet neighbor area . I really enjoyed stayed her house. I wish weather was warmer =(
19268227,413430817,2019-02-17,128264757,Abiola,Great location & amazing space. 10/10 would recommend

20667725,533409161,2019-09-21,60991690,Yu (Richard),Host and her families are very nice. If traveller just take a sleep at night time Charity’s den is ok.
31931312,455307270,2019-05-19,34637717,Reg,Better then expected.
11398750,531873795,2019-09-18,63310954,Reza,I could not imagin this type of place with fee. On the other hand unfortunately I reserved four nights at the beginning and when I got there I found out the place was much worse than I expect. Asked to stay for one night and cancel the other nights and she did not accept. I had to move after the first night and left there. The quality was really awful for this price which reached near CAD 100 after the service fee and others.
13415314,257818097,2018-04-27,183992700,Logan,Pamela was a great host who was quick to answer any questions. The location was amazing and the apartment itself was very stylish and modern. Would definitely recommend!
23597514,529294489,2019-09-14,144941456,Natália,The localization is the main benefit here. I was in town for TIFF and could easily walk to all the theaters. Also nearby there are some great places to eat and I felt really safe even very late at night. The place is small but really clean.
3873403,56276010,2015-12-11,31623621,Yousef,Most amazing place to live in a beautiful neighbourhood. I truly enjoyed ever moment of my stay. This will be my first choice if I am back.
3994370,69063702,2016-04-09,10655135,Danielle,The description is very accurate great wifi friendly and caring hosts. I stayed there for three weeks and my first week was my very first airbnb experience and it was wonderful. They were my home away from home while being in Toronto. 
1100282,468031596,2019-06-11,10014073,Kay-Uwe,We enjoyed our stay with Sun a lot. The appartment is quite large and comfortable. The next subway station is not far away Toronto downtown is easily reachable but even nearby Bloor street is a vital street with many bars restaurants shops. Sun helped us where she could and check-in was very simple.
35126706,469983026,2019-06-15,11268036,Kaltum,I had a lovely stay here. Location is great close to downtown. The room was beautifully decorated and clean. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. Free breakfast was also such a bonus! Would highly recommend
16224853,490365151,2019-07-18,126373038,Sumeet,Teshan's place was great. Includes everything that was mentioned and if we needed anything he was quick to fix it or explain how to do fix the issue. Would recommend as the location was also just a 10 minute drive to the closest TTC station.
1856109,309027941,2018-08-17,95609643,Chai,Indrit has a lovely home in a nice quiet neighborhood. It has all the necessary amenities to make one feel at home. Love the location as it is near a subway station. It makes it easier for me & my family to move around. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Toronto. Regards Ronnie & family. 
13788215,173639319,2017-07-23,140512004,Jenne,Great communication lovely place :) would definitely stay again!

24275330,284980766,2018-07-02,146679765,Bryan,Derek's place is an airbnb that actually feels like a home! A perfect romantical getaway for 2.  
413276,31396711,2015-05-04,19107015,Jeffrey,"I stayed at Robert's apartment for a 3 day weekend trip to Toronto. The apartment is simply fantastic! It's quiet ideally located along Yonge St. (which has a plethora of restaurants and stores) has a great view brightly lit by the natural sunlight and has all the kitchen appliances you need to make yourself feel at home. 
Although I did not get a chance to meet Robert in person my experience with him through text and email was pleasant. He responds quickly to your inquiries and even asks how things are going during your trip to ensure you have everything you need. You don't need to meet Robert to know that he is a reliable and caring host. 
I would recommend renting Roberts apartment and would do so again  myself when I'm in town."
29702788,454594622,2019-05-18,129465927,Sarah,Kristina war sehr nett und Hilfsbereit. Sie hat jede Frage schnell beantwortet und war auch problemlos zu erreichen. Die Wohnung war sehr schön eingerichtet. Bis auf die Sauberkeit habe ich nichts zu bemängeln. Kann die Unterkunft trotzdem sehr empfehlen.
15405298,257314806,2018-04-25,178125864,Josh,This was my first AirBnB stay and wasn't quite sure what to expect. The location was perfect literally right next to all the major sport venues but still a short walk to the Eaton Centre and Queen West. The place was super clean. Will be staying here again for any future sports games etc.
19933681,366884181,2019-01-03,228384241,Mehmet,A cute place close to Yorkville more importantly a great host
832458,5054402,2013-06-10,2811657,Essi,Robin's place is spacious and ideally located in Toronto with very easy access to public transport and the vibrant downtown. She was very personable accommodating and helpful. We had a very late arrival time and she made us feel welcome. She gave us helpful instructions for parking and helped us print a parking permit in her personal office. She was also kind enough to call us after we had checked out to let us know we had left clothing items behind. 
19631936,559041536,2019-11-03,12623627,Faith,Excellent location! I used the Queen Street streetcar several times during my 1-month stay. Chip and Michele live upstairs; they are very nice and non-intrusive.

18252298,366877543,2019-01-03,7059219,Jason,"we had a great stay here for 2 weeks.  I really love this part of Toronto. great coffee shop less than 100m away.  the Dominion pub is around the corner and Figs for breakfast.  we didn't get a chance to go to the stellar Regent Park Aquatic center it's very close by and gorgeous.  we also used the streetcars quite a bit this place benefits from being really close to 2 lines.
house was exactly what we needed for the holidays fire place made it so cozy.  bed in master was very comfy and the check in/out process was so easy. great stay!"
18049018,487965589,2019-07-14,265837222,Tashi,Do not expect from host to reply email and text
4860596,60633485,2016-01-25,54612192,Logan,Elaine and Mike were wonderful hosts house was perfect for the 5 of us. We enjoyed our very comfortable and humble stay at their house. It was easy to get an Uber from the house also there was a subway less then a 5 minute walk away so it was perfect for us. The house is in a safe location and i would love to stay again.

13334249,137982634,2017-03-18,120871227,Khosrow,Sema is very friendly and she welcomes guests and treats them like longtime friends or relatives. I definitely felt at home. The room was comfortable and clean and the location convenient. I highly recommend staying with Sema when visiting town.
17349422,140711961,2017-03-31,34425471,Marwa,We really enjoyed our stay at Sumeet's house. The house is so specious. It has 4 bedrooms living room bathroom and kitchen. Two of the bedrooms are upstairs which gives u a little bit of privacy if needed. Just a note to guests parking should mostly be at the school parking that Sumeet would provide we were unaware of it and we parked in the street not being aware of the rush hour restriction which resulted in our car being towed. Sumeet was very helpful and always available when needed he would go an extra mile for his guests which we really loved. He made out stay easier and provided us with all information needed. The house is few minutes walk to the famous St Clair west street where you can find everything you need.

17137420,240870961,2018-03-06,156814219,Lily,The check in process was awful. The hosts partner was over a half hour late to meeting us and didn't respond to any texts or calls while we were waiting or trying to find the meeting place. The directions for the meeting place were very vague (no specific address or landmark identifier) and it was a very stressful experience since I was coming from a different country. The true saving grace that kept the rating so relatively high was that the space was amazing centrally located and had a great view.
17547979,412793256,2019-02-16,241582698,Owen,Extremely clean with an amazing view. Florin was very easy to communicate with and was always available to provide assistance when needed. Would definitely recommend!

495303,321577369,2018-09-10,4701688,Cara,"Danny is a wonderful host. He was extremely accommodating and he went out of his way to help is out. He really made us feel at home. 

The apartment is very cozy and has everything you need for your stay in Toronto. It’s in a funky neighborhood and right by the train station so it’s easy to get around the city.

I highly recommend Danny’s Airbnb!!"
25685752,291818055,2018-07-16,153982652,Sanga,It was a perfect stay. The house is very clean and tidy. Accurate check-in instructions. Convenient transportation and perfect location. The host is quick response and friendly. Thank you!
22195475,325739048,2018-09-20,25012441,Ramiro,amazing place i  booked for a friend. everything was as described. this is the place to stay if you are visiting Toronto
15549284,128787221,2017-01-27,2262170,James,The price was great. It was a last minute booking and Sean accommodated my guest and I very well. My guest was in crutches and Sean was considerate in helping us check in. He was quick to responding to enquiries and he's even got a 24/7-accessible lockbox for unsupervised check in's and check out's. Everything was as described the wifi Internet access was fast and we really appreciated the use of his kitchen for our quick dinner. Also the washroom has a great sky light.
23625662,339967372,2018-10-22,218150252,Nicole,Die Unterkunft ist auf jeden Fall ihr Geld wert. Es ist eine schöne Unterkunft in einer ruhigen Gegend mit guter Anbindung an die U-Bahn. Bis zur Subway Station sind es ca. 11 km und die Bahn fährt direkt bis ins Zentrum von Toronto. Die Zimmer und die Küche sind gut ausgestattet.
18876549,529244779,2019-09-14,1388720,Kelly,Alice’s place is great.  Good location clean and the sofa beds were pretty comfortable.

17330866,240453577,2018-03-04,171878454,Bobby,This was my first time living on my own and Louis made it feel like home. It is a safe clean and comfy place to live.

6711842,50595567,2015-10-12,8918061,Farnaz,"A really friendly and comfortable place to stay. Karen offers a super healthy breakfast which I was excited about. Home room and bathroom is very neat and clean.  
The home is located close to the Jane Subway Station.  Bloor West street is just a walking distance from home and it is an exotic place to find variety of restaurants Cafes bars shoes and clothes shops.

12583311,311597711,2018-08-21,183159386,Robin,We recommend the Beautiful family friendly home at every one. The public transport acces can't be closer it's a great advantage to discover the town of Toronto. Very pleasant place to rest.
13639052,197135798,2017-09-24,12498733,Melissa,Wonderful stay in a lovely quiet neighbourhood!
27785737,569441303,2019-11-26,71771730,Dean,Super great host ! Stayed with them a few times already ... This time there was a small unforseen circumstance and they quickly responded and accommodated the changes which was truly appreciated ! Will continue to stay with them
15941134,157071072,2017-06-02,11998720,Sofia,"The room is great it is like having a private apartment for yourself. It is really clean  nice and well decorated  The location is great and Mary Paula  Therese and the whole family are really nice.
Better than a four stars hotel .
It' s the best private room I have ever been by airbnb.
The area has a nice atmosphere  plenty of restaurants and shops .
You can walk to most places or take the street car.
It' s the best choice"
17157293,487128956,2019-07-13,71569919,Ali,Anthony's place was excellent. Centrally located clean and cute. Communications leading up to check in were prompt and efficient. Even though we didn't spend too much time in the unit it really felt like home! I would definitely stay here again.
9297579,62700611,2016-02-16,51536561,Francisco,"Great comfortable apartment close to everything. Union station is a block away so catching the subway to get to malls or restaurants was a breeze; not to mention the Union Pearson Express brings you right there in about 20 minutes from the airport. We attended sport-related activities and the Air Canada Centre is super close. So is the Rogers Stadium CN Tower etc. Great views of the lake. There is a great supermarket across the street which allowed us to have breakfast like at ""home"". Carey replied to every message I sent inquiring various things. "
1016125,287694108,2018-07-08,22790221,Charlotte,We had a lovely stay at Jaclyn's apartment. It was really clean and the location was perfect; the neighborhood is super cute as well. Jaclyn was a wonderful host. She was available for advice easy to reach and super flexible. It was nice to meet her as well and I hope we will have the opportunity to stay at her place again. Thanks again Jaclyn! 
5637391,306328700,2018-08-12,85126702,Pauline,We have a good stay in this tiny old house. Well located quiet and clean. 
32311526,457204509,2019-05-23,582999,Nick,"Clean well-appointed well-located hard loft space. Very quick and friendly communication. Comfortable bed. Big beautiful windows and bright sunshine. Spring was only just starting to get warm for our trip but the air-conditioning was capable and I have no doubt it would be just as effective in July. Slow-ish internet but no disconnections.

I will add to Tanya's warnings about sound transference though: there are zero layers of sound deadening between units and most of the building appears to be rented out short-term so you're likely rolling the dice with how thoughtful your neighbours will be (the lock boxes at the back number at least 20 in a smallish building). The televisions and subwoofered techno comfortably died down by about 11pm which was nice but started back up like clockwork at 6am. Directly upstairs specifically was loud TV news and a full apartment vacuum at 6am sharp on a weekday morning. If you're travelling for work or you wake up at this hour anyway it may not bother you. If you're on vacation and are hoping to sleep in to oh 6:30am it probably won't be an option.

The neighbour across the street to the south is also a recording studio that hosts some pretty elaborate parties. They bothered us one weeknight out of two until 1am or so but I can imagine things get pretty exciting on weekends.

Lovely place otherwise! Just be aware if it's incompatible with your sleep schedule or you are a light sleeper (or you cannot wear earplugs for one reason or another)."
24368650,366947637,2019-01-03,144883910,Harjeet,Great place and value would recommend this place to anyone pictures are accurate.
16362158,198467316,2017-09-29,605765,Guillermo,"Hongjing's place is what you see in the description. A double bed in a room private bathroom and a building with great amenities. If you are looking for a hotel-like experience great location awesome gym pool and sauna then this is you place! But if you are looking for a more relaxed experience in which you want to feel home cook some light meals store some food in the fridge or just hang out in the house then look somewhere else.
The apartment is perfect! The view of the city is breathtaking and close to all the attractions in Toronto. Hongjing and Michael are great people. Very kind and easy to talk to. They even gave us some bottles of water because it was very hot when we visited Toronto. They were very clear with the rules but it was not the experience we were looking for. 
In part is our fault because we thought we could do some things that were not listed in the description but on the other hand we felt our reviews were not taken into account when asking simple things like using the kitchen to boil some water unless Hongjing or Michael do it for you. The main problem is that Airbnb is prohibited in the building so they have to keep a low profile when receiving guests. They fear guests could cause a fire and get the attention of the Home Owners Association. We understood but we are in our 45s and we know how to deal with certain things specially after staying in Airbnb's more than 25 times! 
Anyways we can't say we had a bad time we really enjoy our time there but we did not feel home. If you asked me if I would stay again with them.. I'd say yes... but I would be more careful and ask Hongjing the Does and don'ts beforehand!"
16621379,458841885,2019-05-26,55438765,Kristen,Great place. Easy to find and very clean. Just what we needed for our group
22321339,289142785,2018-07-11,185248129,Stephen,Maria’s place is in an ideal stop.  Although small it offers everything a traveler could ask for.  It’s right in the downtown area 45 floors up overlooking the lake.  And is remarkably quit for its location.  I don’t believe you will be disappointed.  And with the cost of accommodations thee days it easy on the pocketbook.
16548328,303514057,2018-08-07,57007083,Mason,Ben's place is gorgeous and looks exactly like the photos depict. Huge windows for lots of natural sunlight and breathtaking views of Toronto. Beds are super comfy and all amenities are spot on.

1179469,51408587,2015-10-19,32625714,Adam,Cara made me feel very at home for my entire stay. She was extremely accommodating from check-in to check out and always willing to go the extra mile to give suggestions on all aspects of my trip including restaurants transportation or shops in the area. The room was clean comfortable and was walking distance from everything that I needed. I would definitely rent again in the future! 
7132306,325768502,2018-09-20,100250414,Lorelei,Judy was so accommodating and made sure my every need was taken care of. very homey feel to her charming flat. She made suggestions on where to go and was super easy going! excellent experience !

15845514,183923060,2017-08-18,86611874,Colleen,Crystal was an excellent host and was very easy to communicate with.  I booked my stay last minute and she was able to accommodate me.  It was in a great location close to public transit and good restaurants.  The unit was very clean and the photos were very accurate
26042659,527303621,2019-09-10,253093217,Rebecca,Michael was friendly and welcoming and we felt at home straight away! The bed was comfortable good shower too and everything was very clean & tidy. We liked the location too as it's not right in the centre but doesn't take long to get in. We also enjoyed meeting Louis a very well behaved and sweet natured little dog!
1718363,22828450,2014-11-16,13357541,Faze,"I stayed at Lotoyas place for a little over a month. I have to say it was one of my best Airbnb experiences so far. 
The apartment was neat and tidy very clean and extremely comfortable. I felt at home here straight away. 
The location is perfect. I highly doubt you can get a better location than this in Toronto. You are right in the middle of all the action walking distance from all the cool spots and 2 mins away from the subway if you need to venture beyond downtown. Even though you are in the middle of it all the apartment is quiet and peaceful. 
Lotoya was an awesome host. Really cool easy going and always helpful. Great experience wish I could have stayed there longer."
15268259,330377407,2018-09-30,196350980,Megan,Beautiful clean space. Hostvwas quick to respond and very helpful
22467852,327316937,2018-09-23,154723414,Cassidy,Very accurate pictures and description. Location only 15 minutes to downtown and close to multiple restaurants. Very clean and quick responses.
8237869,58438444,2016-01-02,31697955,Krizia,The basement apartment is really clean and has all the basic necessities like towels and toiletries. It is also in a good location at a quiet and safe neighborhood. The host is very nice and he even offered a small bottle of champagne for NYE.
6703398,104096089,2016-09-25,74026354,Sachere,"My stay at Christine's place was great! Christine is a very gracious host.  She's was there to greet me and show me around my accomodations she was very  quick to reply to any questions I had or to provide anything I needed and kept in touch with me throughout to make sure I was enjoying my stay. 

The space is located right across from a beautiful park in a great artsy upcoming neighborhood full of good eats and unique shops.  It's a 5-8 minute walk to the grocery stores pharmacy Starbuck's and Tim Horton.  Plus it's close to downtown Toronto and has frequent running transportation right outside the door and right around the corner.

This place has everything advertised and many extra touches to make you feel at home. Having a full kitchen and washer and dryer made the space a perfect choice for me.  

I would certainly recommend Christine's  place and would look to stay there again on my next trip to Toronto. "
31448164,507560353,2019-08-11,279774086,Sydnee,Great place to stay at! Host was very responsive and was helpful with anything we needed

13413180,254909122,2018-04-18,65237290,Gabriel,Beautiful apartment incredible view and perfect location. Definitely worth it. Many of the sights are within walking distance
17570124,141913678,2017-04-05,370946,Bertrand,Great location right in front of beautiful High Park.  Not far from Keele and High Park subway stations and 10-minute walk to lively Bloor West Village.
21369050,314225121,2018-08-26,12930913,Amy,Beautiful suite with new appliances and really sparkly clean! Host has lots of thoughtful touches to the place. Because it's the basement there can be foot steps from above but it's quiet during the night!
19473823,315393593,2018-08-28,210584870,Jamie,Branko's place is  great! Really well located in Toronto just a 10 minute walk to Yonge Street. His neighbourhood is hip and there are tons of restaurants coffee bars etc all within 5-10 minutes on foot. He is also close to the streetcar and subway. The apartment has EVERYTHING you need....from wifi to a coffeemaker. ..even umbrellas for his guests. The apartment is spotless and my room waa private clean and very comfortable. Branko is prompt in his responses and is a great host for example he  had no issues with me checking out an hour later. I will stay again in his space. 
21916347,222357180,2017-12-29,30903004,Alexis,Had a great stay!
6445326,54735601,2015-11-23,47062164,Polina,Nadia was very welcoming and responsive. The neighborhood was great. Safe location and walking distance to many attractions. We walked all over town. There was an outage in the area and we did not have any internet for the entire 3 days so I cannot vote for reliable internet. The apartment however is very nice and clean! The balcony has great view and very comfortable chairs with cushions. The layout of the apartment is very good too. We were three people so two bathrooms and doors for the bedrooms allowed for privacy. We had a great time so this was a gem find! We didn't want to leave :) Thank you Nadia!
28283405,453022476,2019-05-14,239397828,Marina,It's too cold room.
21216328,265027830,2018-05-15,184869774,Ana,Excellent location. I loved having Jade as my companion for the weekend. :) I found there was a bit of noise from people in the hall or tv's in surrounding apartments but it was pretty quiet after 10 or 11. Bed was very comfortable.
18052905,420389632,2019-03-06,116852045,Vanessa,Dev and his co-hosts were fantastic and thorough from before I checked in until the day of check out.  First-class experience :)
14510316,218930397,2017-12-15,121225047,Sarah,Erik was a fabulous host. House was clean and had all the necessities. Thanks for letting us stay at your home!
9714889,285732841,2018-07-04,7786088,Carol,Very welcoming home in a good downtown location.  We really appreciated quiet and efficient air conditioning as we arrived during a hot spell.  Easy walk to the subway from which major attractions can be accessed.  Especially recommend Distillery District.  Would definitely recommend these hosts.
13825053,542571136,2019-10-06,74290813,Shiza,I went with a group of 4 people and the room we got was quite small with one queen bed a single bed and a very uncomfortable futon. The ceiling of this room was really low where most of could not stand straight (and for someone with claustrophobia it is not good). We got there in the evening and the sitter greeted us she said the room should have been cleaned but the vaccum was sitting there but the ground was not very clean. We realized how uncomfortable the futon was so Kristen called after hearing how the accomodations weren't what we expected. She allowed us to sleep on a sofabed downstairs which was equally uncomfortable. She did tell us that typically she would charge for the sofa bed as well but won't this time so that was nice. The entire place was freezing and we all did not sleep well. For one night one room we paid 270 which is quite high as the location is not close to downtown Toronto rather is in a residential area. Just be careful when choosing this place and read all the ceiling heights.
13298933,510881644,2019-08-16,198528046,Keana,First and foremost I would like to say that the location of this apartment is amazing! It is right by Queen St in a very safe and trendy neighborhood. We didn’t experience any problems with the Airbnb itself. It was very clean and well-equipped. My boyfriend and I were comfortable in the small space but it probably would not be ideal for a prolonged stay if you are not staying by yourself.
19893144,420133337,2019-03-05,238143340,Heather,Great location!
21814070,263663054,2018-05-12,57384095,Alexandre,Nous avons occupé l'appartement de Fardin durant 8 jours et nous n'avons eu aucun problème. L'appartement est situé à 20 min à pied de la CN Tower et à 15 min de la street art. Au niveau transports et restaurations  il y a vraiment tout à côté. Le seul souci c'est la salle de bain qui manquait de propreté ainsi qu'un balais pour le sol.
26723899,427381763,2019-03-23,96891387,Amy,Beautiful apartment and location.  Great place to hangout with friends in. Everything was good except for when we wanted to clean up we were unable to find garbage bags also we felt that the parking was expensive for such a small inconvenient lot in which the neighbours came over at night and had to ask us to move our cars but we had been drinking.
4195081,24956798,2015-01-04,24371835,Kristen,From the moment the booking was made Jeremy was an excellent host. He contacted me immediately to follow up with any questions and stayed in touch through out my stay to ensure all was well.  His home is very comfortable with all the amenities and met all my expectations not to mention the location is prime!  View is amazing and within walking distance to all main attractions.  Without a doubt I will definitely be a returning guest.  Big thanks to Jeremy for making my first booking with Airbnb an extremely positive experience.     
14662932,530985811,2019-09-16,127065119,Aña-Lisa,Sparkling clean spacious and beautifully decorated—it’s like living in a magazine spread for your vacation. Very close to the airport train makes arriving/departing super easy. We had everything we needed in this quiet beautiful neighborhood!
7341262,466888070,2019-06-09,263300418,Amy,Place was in a great location close to the subway. It was a bit smaller than expected and not recommended for people above 6’3. Ceilings are a little low. Very clean. The host was quick to respond over text and very friendly! We did hear the neighbours a few times but overall private and a good experience.
7658019,101111028,2016-09-11,22242055,Anja,Lily war perfekt. Der Blick ist traumhaft die Umgebung absolut (Website hidden by Airbnb) ist zu Fuss gut zu erreichen. Ich werde wieder kommen und hoffe dann wieder bei Lily wohnen zu können. Thanks Lily for a wonderful time
32158653,482495894,2019-07-06,30451352,Felicia,We were very much looking forward to our stay with Chris in her Toronto condo with city views and a large terrace.  It was sure to be the highlight of our family vacation given all the stellar reviews about the condo and the host.  To our surprise and disappointment we did not have the same experience as other guests and wondered if we were in the correct condo.  While the city views from the condo were amazing the terrace a key feature and the reason we chose this condo was overgrown with weeds.  Amenities such as the in-unit washer and dryer were also not working properly and several of the kitchen appliances hadn’t been throughly cleaned.  There were also some safety hazards that we brought to the host’s attention.  It was surprising that prior guests hadn’t mentioned these issues.  Nevertheless we tried to do our part to help the host and the next guest by troubleshooting or fixing what we could and alerting the host of items that needed immediate attention before the next guest arrived.  While we hadn’t ever had a similar Airbnb experience we understand that things can go unexpectedly wrong.  What most frustrated us was the lack of responsiveness and attentiveness from our super host when things did go wrong.  We heard from Chris initially and then only via automated reminder messages.  She never followed up with us to check if the issues were resolved.  While Steve the co-host tried to address our concerns and resolved some of them such as weeding the terrace our experience would have been so much better and more tolerable if we knew our hosts really cared that we would have a great stay.
31222461,568557756,2019-11-24,310447872,Erica,This place was perfect and Peyman was a great host. Answered all my questions quickly and the apartment was clean and very comfortable! Highly recommend this place!
8016701,76284025,2016-05-26,21744071,William,Amazing experience. The apartment is very nicely furnished bed was very comfortable and the location was very close to the conference center I was going to. Nicholas was very responsive to requests over chat. Would definitely recommend for anyone thinking of staying here.
19317016,346681694,2018-11-09,134467554,Santana,Beautiful clean space and great location in the city! Would book again :)

22526399,541655674,2019-10-05,26289538,Benjamin,Ben's place was exactly as described. Location was the best. It had a lot of kitchen ware which was good if you wanna cook. The apartment faces the street. You could hear cars sometimes. But the bedroom faces inward which makes it better. Nice and tidy and it has Netflix. Ben allowed us to store our luggage after checking out.

33442386,464027908,2019-06-04,1320169,Ty,Very nice suite.  Clean and had everything we needed.
33169996,463604204,2019-06-03,5306180,DeeDee,Paola's apartment is a nice space very close to a subway and near to a vibrant neighbourhood. She was quick to respond to all of my questions and accommodating.
13988682,487887729,2019-07-14,19809637,Ryan,Susan did a wonderful job communicating prior to the trip by responding within minutes to every question I had. I’ve never been to another AirBnB that was so prepared for visitors/families with instructions for everything food toiletries toys etc. Coming to a complementary fully stocked refrigerator and pantry was surreal. The home is in close proximity to a homeless shelter and there is a lot of foot traffic around the area. However no one bothered us for the 4 days we were there.
21933961,224581486,2018-01-03,1727944,Erynn,"Michael’s home was extremely welcoming to my group. His home is absolutely stunning with subtle touches that were very much noticed. You can see that Michael and his wife are very fun well travelled and hip as ever with an extremely cozy & loving vibe. 
I apologized for any “noise” we made and Michael was extremely gracious about this. Though this is NOT an invitation to do so! He was extremely swift with communication and kind regarding our noise.
The neighbourhood is very hip quaint quiet yet lively at the same time! If Michael will have me back I would book again in a heartbeat!"
19991801,513453823,2019-08-19,58901507,Nathan,Sergei and Larina's place is hands down one of the best places I've ever stayed at. The suite looks exactly like it does in the listings: clean stylish and great value for money. They went out of their way to meet us and extended admirable hospitality. Highly highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in a convenient space in uptown Toronto!
7292777,464888980,2019-06-06,13134933,Deanna,Very pleasant stay!! Fast communication seamless check-in super clean great location and view. Would highly recommend and would love to stay here again :)
19136292,176729909,2017-07-31,73459041,Victoria,We had a great time at Jenna and David's place! The apartment is in a great location close to the subway and a bunch of restaurants in the area. I definitely recommend their place to anyone looking to see this area of Toronto.

7834160,300602138,2018-08-02,27889863,Hans,"What a beautiful and fine place to stay! It couldn't be better!! 
Being a chemistry teacher I give Rick and his airbnb a mark of 10 out of 10 ;)

Very spacious and clean. The atmospere of the house is  very charming. The beds were excellent and the sitting room was cosy. Big tv screen with netflix and PSP3 player (which we didn't need because Toronto is such a wonderful city to visit). The bathroom was perfect and well equipped. Private parking around the corner (not suitable for full size suv's). The place lies in a quiet street with characteristic houses. We endorse you a walk around that part of Toronto.

The kitchen had all you need: stove microwave toaster coffee machine complete cutlery etc. All you need for a good breakfast was in the refigerator and/or freezer. More than enough things to chose from: bagels butter peanut butter  jam orange juice soft drinks. Also coffe and a variety of tea. Perhaps I forgot something but we didn't run short of anything at all. And even if that should be the case we only would have to knock on Rick's door downstairs so he would do groceries.

We got a warm welcome from Rick when we arrived. He showed us around the house and gave lots of good tips about the city. He drew out a walking tour for us on the map through the neighbourhoods nearby to centre of town which was very nice to do! 

Temperatures were very high when we went there but with the airconditioning we could sleep well. 

Just a one minute walk from the house and you are in a street with all kinds of restaurants shops and a bus stop to go to centre town. 

In short a great place to stay and we will certainly recommend it to all our friends and family. In case our sons go back in future they will for sure book Rick's place to stay!!"
26951985,294902395,2018-07-22,165505789,Danilo,Andy’s place is amazing clean and comfortable. Andy is very atencious. 
14549864,180194787,2017-08-09,73630200,Tarad,Would recommend this place to anyone nice quiet neighbourhood close to a mall and the train station and they provided pesto cards which are needed. The apartment was really clean and welcoming!!
22808990,435844643,2019-04-11,249711219,Kerstin,Everything was great. Anytime again.
21383495,279422750,2018-06-20,178812788,Brandy Lee,Susan's place was an amazing treat. It is in a great location close to many things and a reasonable walk to others. The apartment itself was gorgeous and comfy. Cleanliness was top notch! I will definitely look into staying again when next in Toronto.
5095603,42221931,2015-08-11,27834839,Sean,Heather was amazing. Everything was explained very well. She was pleasant and made us feel like we guests in her home. When I'm back in Toronto I'll be sure to stay at her home again.
2267889,341711399,2018-10-27,70100514,Ozlem,We couldn't see each other but she was very nice and she was very responsive.
18995544,431175947,2019-03-31,222791372,Junior,Nice confortable place
26723899,500091464,2019-08-01,16598631,Jana,Overall a great experience! The location was perfect for our group - in a very hip neighborhood close to tons of restaurants and unique shops. The space was clean and modern. It was tough to find the entrance and parking when we first arrived and the door keypad was tricky to lock. It took us several tries every time we went out. Could have used some wash cloths and more towels. I would stay here again.
6852996,45436623,2015-09-02,40235940,Xiaoyuan,很好的地方非常干净｡ :)
8616212,183551198,2017-08-17,121459389,Jolene,Monica was such an amazing host. Very friendly and helpfull! The apartment was clean and had everything you'll need. The view of the cn tower & the city from the balcony was absolutely beautiful! The water is close (10 min walk) bus/ streetcar stops are close (2 min walk) and food & shopping is all around. I'd definitely come back to Monicas place if I happen to come back to Toronto!
14693392,238677335,2018-02-26,67720208,Jennifer,This is a perfect place for a Toronto weekend getaway! Close to everything easy access  clean and Karadice responded instantly to any questions. Would definitely use it again!!
3241344,81447247,2016-06-23,18263611,Mike And Terri,I've stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels that are not as nice as Caroline's space.  Pure class and comfort from one end of the unit to the other.  Incredibly well decorated and equipped.  As a host Caroline is one of the best!  I'll be back and if you see this space as available book it you won't be disappointed.
3438572,34512197,2015-06-08,582999,Nick,This is a very comfortable clean warm home in a convenient spot in the heart of Parkdale. It's a gem run almost as a small hostel by its laid-back but efficient host Victoria whose friendliness never ceases and who will go to great lengths to ensure your comfort. You'll be happy here whether you want a quiet night in or just a place to retire to after a night out or even if you join Victoria and her friends for a barbecue. You'll find that they're all fantastic people too. I highly recommend Parkdale Place for your trip to Toronto. 
20269906,466871082,2019-06-09,127365034,Dan,nice quaint basement apt on a quiet neighborhood street.  Close enough to a lot of things to do but far enough to not feel surrounded by nightlife
1803281,200793662,2017-10-06,7901268,Chris,Awesome....what a wonderful airbnb experience :) thumbs up
17810700,487931721,2019-07-14,61310041,Tess,Alexis’s place was exactly as described and about a 10 minute walk to the subway/vibrant shops and restaurants on the Danforth. It was very neat clean and comfortable and we really appreciated the cool temperature on super hot Toronto days. Unfortunately the WiFi wasn’t working for most of our stay but Alexis did try to resolve the problem while out of town and communication about the issue was great. Thanks for everything Alexis!
3860565,256800662,2018-04-23,8500401,Navid,Brenda was a super nice and friendly host!
14773443,120745009,2016-12-11,66342419,Sunshine,The apartment was cozy and adorable with an absolutely breath-taking view of the city. Everything was super clean and smelled freshly laundered. Neighborhood is quiet for a good night's sleep but you're also way too high up to hear anything. In a part of downtown that's walking distance to anything that you'd need. You can see the owner's personal touch in the apartment which adds a homely feel rather than just another rental space purely for the purpose of airbnb. Would highly recommend.
20172681,567797056,2019-11-23,217284728,Umut,Doris is simply amazing. She was so helpful and understanding. As a newcomer to Canada I really felt at home at her place and she even helped and advised me about life and work in Canada in general. Also she changes the sheets weekly. The place is really comfy and warm. Even when it was really cold outside you don't feel it yet it's not stuffy either. There is a really big Loblaws within walking distance that you can find everything you need. It was a really nice experience staying at Doris' place and would definitely recommend if anybody I knew was coming to Toronto.
31240733,503184763,2019-08-05,92605064,Agnieszka,Tiana's place is very comfortable and its location is great. The flat has everything one needs and it is within a walking distance from the University and many touristic attractions.
15803435,514668439,2019-08-21,239592600,Lauriane,"Je recommande vivement ce logement il est confortable et a rempli tous nos critères.
Lors de nos échanges par messages l'hôte s'est montré disponible et bienveillant."
16632051,148349453,2017-04-30,8583241,Kevin,Awesome space. Bright clean comfortable. High water pressure was an added bonus.  Great cafe a couple doors down. We walked almost everywhere we needed. Thanks! 
16207713,210649402,2017-11-10,100435504,Hal,Ph and his wife are a very charming couple and treated us very well. The location was great for us and the neighbourhood was very quiet and peaceful. We would gladly stay again if the need arose.

24558138,344070541,2018-11-02,220081946,Paromita,The place is really big. The location is great too. We only had problems with the kitchen utensils which were not as clean as we expected.
13605154,495111070,2019-07-25,45026350,Ed,"I cannot begin to put into words how great of a time I had at Olga's apartment. The apartment was spotless fully supplied for any our needs during a short stay and had a priceless view of the CN Tower.

Olga herself was always attentive and went above and beyond for us - from quick communication about doing an early check-in and supplying materials for local food recs I always felt like she was truly making sure our stay was nothing but perfection. Plus the entire apartment was beautiful. Whenever I'm back in Toronto I will make sure to reserve this place."
29613234,435454661,2019-04-10,166201410,Al & Raeanne,Noura is a great host and very friendly. Her place is in a great location close to the lake and in walking distance of everything downtown. Added bonuses were the gym and pool. In addition there is a really great Japanese restaurant right around the corner.
36695402,502431723,2019-08-04,238481473,Bader,Good shit
25843793,507461275,2019-08-11,386679,Samantha,Romy’s apartment was in an amazing location and was a wonderful experience for us! It was really fun to see what it would be like to live in one of those iconic Toronto skyscrapers. I can not even describe that beautiful view! Her place was safe clean comfortable and had everything we needed. There is a grocery on the main floor with good hours and selection.
10570120,260340063,2018-05-04,36067769,Léonie,We spent nice 5 nights in Aj's apartment. Really close to the metro streetcars and any facilities you need when you travel for work. We also enjoyed the communication with Aj (so reactive and accommodant even before our stay) the fact that it was really easy to access the Airbnb and that we had multiples keys. Neighbourhood was calm and nice the apartment was convenient. So thanks!
23437335,269533119,2018-05-27,188875895,Baker,"Barbara is a great and awesome host. The place is very clean and well organized.

I highly recommend this place"
17712437,225451477,2018-01-06,49024265,Lauren,Eric was a great communicator and responsive when it cane to check in! His place is beautifully decorated and is VERY close to the metro that takes you into DT Toronto.

Would stay again!"
31948833,567815899,2019-11-23,142321949,Wendy,Great location.  A bit of neighborhood noise but I guess that's to be expected for a big city.  Clean.  Bed was on the firm side.  Any questions asked were responded to quickly.
5521420,88149472,2016-07-23,40531638,Colleen,"It is easy to see why Sandy has been designated a SuperHost.  Not only is she a lovely personable individual but she is an attentive and dedicated host. We had several terrific conversations ranging from pets to television shows and had I been there longer I am sure we could have talked for hours! And laughed even more! This was my first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better. Sandy made me feel very welcome and I never felt as if I was intruding. I love houses and this place is beautiful with many original features and thoughtful upgrades.  The location is fantastic on a safe. well-lit street with friendly neighbours. It is within walking distance of some great restaurants (about which Sandy will provide detailed information) The bedroom was incredibly clean.  The bed which I initially thought might be a bit too soft for me turned out to be really comfortable with nice soft sheets.  It was oppressively hot during my stay but with air conditioning and a fan I was more than comfortable and slept surprisingly well. The bathroom was pristine and has a fantastic rain shower head that is more like a monsoon head as it delivers a great deluge of water.  Great bath products too!   Special mention of Sandy's lovely girl dog Roxie who is obviously a treasured companion.  
I am pretty forgetful and had to return a few times for my phone glasses etc. We joked about this and I love that Sandy took to ensuring that I had all my stuff when coming and going.  It was very sweet of her to take such an interest and I appreciated it. 
  Many of my friends were surprised by my decision to stay at an Airbnb location and thought the idea a dubious one.  I was very pleased to be able to detail such a positive experience to them.
Thanks so much Sandy.  So happy to have met you.

You would have to be there to embrace the subtleties. It was perfect for the two of us spacious and immaculate! The host was more than accommodating and friendly. Would definitely return in a heartbeat and recommend to anyone. 
6732046,279380194,2018-06-20,192176524,Jennifer,Cute basement apartment that accommodated our family of five well. Jonathan and Joanne are great and very available to give tips on restaurants or sites to see. The kitchen is well-stocked and easy to use for dining in. The location is very accessible to various neighborhoods in the city. We are really great stay and enjoyed our time!

The kitchen is big the bed comfortable and the location conveniently close to Glencairn station. It suited me well going to downtown for a week.
A great place to stay!"
44452,2475018,2012-10-01,3599817,Paul,Key to get in building was not working however that was the buildings issues still annoying tho.  Parking was so cheap $10 a day.  Great location.  Cleaning fee to me means place will be (Website hidden by Airbnb) was OK.  Mark was great to deal with. Location was awesome. It worked for us very well.

3905999,37857144,2015-07-11,33401168,Patrice,This was our first experience using Airbnb and we were not disappointed. We had an amazing experience the accommodations were just as described and more the layout of the condo was spacious bright clean and well equipped with extras.  Loved the decor. We greatly appreciated the personal time you would take to address any of our concerns.  I would definitely recommend this to others.

The place was exactly as shown. And the hosts were extremely friendly. 
Thank you again for sharing your home with us. It was beautiful."
28356847,538211686,2019-09-29,27602309,Kari,Billy’s place was as advertised. Checking in and out was easy because of his communication. Overall I would suggest this place to someone who is looking for a low key place to stay for an evening or two.
15646181,204973912,2017-10-20,150829824,Emma,Great pad in a quiet area handy to subway.  Great value for money and Heather couldnt be more helpful. Some nice little touches make your stay even more comfortable. I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else if looking in this area.

28963462,528205752,2019-09-12,188840687,Alyssa,Overall nice place for a short stay. Had some issues with check-in (to be fair I arrived a day late and it sounds like one of the other guests took the front door key out of the lockbox so this sounds like it was beyond Spencer’s control.) However in my two weeks there another couple also had issues as their unit door code for entry was different than had been provided. Spencer responded very quickly to both issues and resolved them within minutes of notification which was excellent. The patio was nice but the furniture was broken and although Spencer was very kind and offered to replace it this ultimately never happened. The sound of cars from Avenue Road can be quite loud. Overall it’s good value for the price and a good spot for a short stay close to Yorkville. I’d stay there again.
34010166,489407040,2019-07-16,17290384,Christine,My daughter and I had a fabulous stay in Peter's unit!  The unit/condo and the host hospitality were both outstanding.  The unit is modern and super stylish with large windows and a lovely balcony. The kitchen is stunning and fully kitted out with all one might need.  Coffee and sugar being provided was a nice touch!  The shower is awesome! The condo building is modern and has THE BEST GYM ever - huge and loads of every type of cardio and weight training equipment. All the amenities were fantastic and the unit was spotless.  Peter is incredible - professional friendly welcoming and super responsive to all queries.  It's 5 star concierge service all the way! The location is fabulous - a short walk from all Toronto has to offer and the subway system. Very highly recommended.

1733291,31831623,2015-05-10,29705787,Sandra,My family and I went to Toronto this past weekend for my moms birthday and mothers day. Dan was an absolutely amazing host. He responded to messages and phone calls right away helped with whatever we needed and accommodated our every need. His apartment is very clean and comfy (also has an amazing view)! We had six people stay in his apartment but if needed could have fit 8. It was very roomy! Also his apartment is in am amazing location its within walking distance of many restaurants shops and attractions and also within driving distance of some of the best things to do in Toronto. I would strongly recommend Dan and his apartment to anyone looking to have a wonderful stay in Toronto! I will definitely use him and his apartment again!
14781093,240896777,2018-03-06,175273214,Yu,House was great and spacious and clean. Definitely worth the amount Ken charges!
25140211,304483445,2018-08-09,24916662,Maureen,I loved my stay at Cassandra's place! It's a fantastic space to come home to after busy work days in Toronto and Cassandra and Arland are so welcoming. The suite had everything I need - a nice living room kitchen space and a super-comfortable bed in a cozy quiet bedroom. The neighbourhood is great and one of my faves in Toronto. And their dog Baanjo is adorable like a little sweet bear - I've never really been a dog person but Baanjo is special and no trouble at all. I look forward to staying at Cassandra's again!
16712953,173629602,2017-07-23,4242336,Larry,All was good!  Only minor issue was no cable TV.  Ability was helpful and responsive.
15051450,179847340,2017-08-08,15852730,Ramona,An excellent host!  Such a pleasure to come in on a late flight and have some refreshments in the fridge for us.  All of the little extra things provided in the home so we didn't have to purchase anything extra.  Diane is very friendly and checks in frequently to ensure our stay is going well.  The location is great!
1173944,366486722,2019-01-02,5955836,Matthew,The apartment is absolutely perfect and R.J. was the consummate host. The building is well-situated on a quiet corner in one of our favorite areas of Toronto. The space receives a great deal of natural light; has large generous spaces; and has a number of architectural features that lend the entire apartment and our experience for that matter a really wonderful atmosphere. We will no doubt be staying here again and would highly recommend !

You find various interesting restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The flat was very clean and communication with Annie was very easy. 
14693392,245485620,2018-03-22,165660258,Kristen,This was my first Airbnb experience and it went perfectly. The location of the condo is perfect for anyone going to the ACC Rogers Centre and the aquarium. Very clean and an amazing view. Will definitely be coming back!

18893052,362115629,2018-12-25,54226533,Tais,My friends and I only stayed one day in Loren's  house but was amazing. The house has a great size for one group and the rooms are comfortable. The living room is great with a big TV.
21663069,480854504,2019-07-03,43341594,Simi,"This was a happy discovery for us when we found ourselves in a lurch over Canada Day weekend. The host (Julie) was gracious and let us check in early. Beautiful space (""cosier"" than expected but space well utilized). Our favourite feature was the bathroom skylight! Pleasant  ""walkable"" neighborhood too. On the whole we enjoyed our stay."

16425784,485847620,2019-07-11,79280550,Frank,This place is awesome!
573892,47176748,2015-09-16,883194,Tunç,Frank met me in front of the building. He was very polite he showed how everything worked in detail. He took his time to take me around the building showed the gym pool and shopping mall in the basement of the building. Location is excellent right across the Union station. View is great. Condo was super clean luxurious just the way it was in the photos. It was a very comfortable stay.  I was in Toronto for business and this place was everything I was looking for. Only thing that bothered me Frank required the place to be throughly clean ready for next guest. I would never trash an apartment I am renting and of course I did my very best to leave it as clean as possible but I was stressed if I'd have enough time for cleaning. After-all we are paying a cleaning fee in airbnb included in our total bill and I believe it'd be more fair to me and to the next guest after me if the flat was cleaned by someone professional.
12605193,174374152,2017-07-25,28888818,Kevin,"No surprises with the place or the host. We found this location to be excellent for walking around the city and for being a safe and convenient place to rest in the evenings. Right beside the Expo grounds 5-10 minutes from the lake 20-25 mins from the Entertainment district and most other neighborhoods were within 30 min - 1 hour away by foot. Tram cars were stopping right in front of the building. Parking the car underground was no issue.

This was my first AirBnB and the host was quick to respond to all my questions before and during the stay. Couldn't be happier with how it turned out."

10995230,156450342,2017-05-30,12456117,Peter,"Julia was a really great host! We coordinated via the Airbnb app every step of the way up till we met up at the property.

We were given a thorough tour of the property as well as the car park because we thought we would need it during our stay. Check-in and out were both a breeze.

The place is on the Western side of downtown but it is quiet and very easy to walk to and from which we did. Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport is just down the road and there is a tram right down the street.

Property itself is very clean and is enough for two or three people to stay (a bed for two and a couch). There is a small kitchen if you need to cook anything while you're there as well as an in-unit washer/dryer complete with everything you'll need to get a load of laundry done if needed. 

Would definitely stay at one of Julia's properties again when we are in town!"

5746615,316650913,2018-08-31,134482781,Kristina,Maya's place was perfect for us and our little baby. The apartment had everything we needed. The location is great. Couple minutes walk to the St.Lawrence market and less than 10 minutes walk to the Eaton centre. Maya is highly responsive and very helpful. We highly recommend this host.
21885109,271498257,2018-06-01,151401385,Divya,Awesome host! Great stay and very clean. Sal allowed us to check in early as well. More than the stay it was pleasure meeting you in person Sal. He is supercool very friendly.  I would highly recommend this place to stay and it’s close to downtown. You can take street car to downtown which is just 2 mins walk from Sal place. Apart from this there are lot many supermarkets which is jus 5 to 10 mins walk. Thank you Sal!

9382997,239189122,2018-02-28,51857579,Cristina,Karen was very sweet and responsive. She gave us tips on where to go and chatted with us for a bit. That unit was worth the value.
17951694,204956439,2017-10-20,74159137,Ravi,A truly delight place to stay.  Larger than expected and contains everything you could wish for.  One of the best equipped kitchen I've ever seen in AIRbnb accommodation.  I felt home immediately.   I can not recommend Krystal's place enough.  I booked a very last minute and communication was easy.  Thanks go to Krystal for the supplies she left on fridge when we arrived very late.
14771353,508859965,2019-08-13,36388129,Roch,Nice neighbourhood and nice location. It was my second time at Sherry’s place. Great amenities and great communication with her. I’m always checking her place when I’m traveling to Toronto.
22718533,551891079,2019-10-20,3639436,Jason,Someone ought to contact the city of Toronto to enforce the Noise by-laws. The garbage trucks run almost hourly all night long up and down Gladstone Avenue and the Tim Horton's across the street does it's deliveries at about 3 am. I lost my last night's sleep on account of the loading platform being dropped loudly from the delivery truck at that time.
12891524,84091700,2016-07-05,58047985,Aranie,My first time using Airbnb and I'm glad I stayed at Irina's place! She's an accommodating host and the place was perfect for my short term stay. The AC was a bit loud at times but the bed was very comfortable and the place was very organized and clean. Would stay here again if I get the chance!
3517167,173997130,2017-07-24,102627992,Mike,The condo is well-appointed and very clean.  Husain is a great host who gives you your space but is ready with help and advice if you want it.   This is a great location for the center of Toronto - it's about 15-20 minute walk to the CN tower to give you some perspective.
5825038,323411467,2018-09-15,118682980,Sandra,You can expect a warm welcome from Ben and Anita. Nothing is too much trouble and they go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your holiday.

Great stay. Hosts could not have been more welcoming and helpful in getting us settled in for our 3 day stay. Room accomodations were the best and matched a 4 star hotel level."

The neighborhood is very nice - a leafy suburb and not far at all from public transportation to downtown Toronto. We would definitely stay again hopefully for longer next time. Thank you so much! :)

1080121,8057054,2013-10-14,9031222,Samuel,"Kate was a great host. She was flexible when it came to checking in (i was 1.5hrs late) and when it came time to check out she was able to hold our bags. When I first arrived she provided me with a great overview of the neighbourhood which was very nice and also had maps of the area that I could take with me.  

I would definitely rent from Kate again."

Great neighborhood not long walking distance to subway station and lots of restaurants and cafes! 
Definitely would recommend this place to people who are looking for affordable place to stay in a great location! 
Thanks a lot!"
14874815,121701334,2016-12-18,6619818,Rocchina,The apartment was in a great location for our events that night and the perfect place for us to crash. The only downside was how how the apartment got in the middle of the night.

7774544,510746476,2019-08-16,139650120,Stewart,Exactly as described. Excellent location and the included parking makes it a great deal.
4020596,190960540,2017-09-05,3989704,John,The cabin was well located near to busy Bloor Street yet the cabin was quiet and secluded and I slept well during my 4 night stay. The kettle came in handy for making my morning tea and there were plenty of cafes on Bloor. I appreciated the wireless internet access. I was away from the cabin for much of my visit and did not have a chance to interact with the house residents except for the last night when they generously invited me over for cake. There were no problems accessing the bathroom in the basement. Using the loft bed in the cabin was an adventure but there were no mishaps climbing the ladder. I enjoyed my stay and would consider returning next year.
5509560,277532408,2018-06-16,39530348,Mary,"Beautiful place essentially private with separate access. Amanda could not have been more helpful providing transport and local tips.

20153310,470716751,2019-06-16,45853205,Nicole,Great communication but the suite is lacking some basic kitchen stuff. Decent value for money but it is in the basement and while there’s a washer dryer and a kitchen there was no laundry detergent microwave pots non-plastic cups etc.
12157556,249716550,2018-04-02,6815212,Donnie,Very affordable and close to the airport very hostel like.  Clean kitchen and bathroom nice laundry.  I.T has hardwood floors so you can hear everyone in the common spaces even in your room but I.T wasn’t too bad for us.

4525382,52040000,2015-10-26,6768497,Emily,This spotless spacious home in a quiet neighborhood was perfect for our group of 5 adults visiting Toronto!  The ample 3.5 baths 3 bedrooms (each with a private full bathroom) full kitchen and lovely patios and balconies meant we were always comfortable and had plenty of room!  Jenny left us a detailed reference notebook with plenty of recommendations and resources for the area.  We were just outside the hustle of the big city but getting into the city when we wanted was so easy with the proximity to the buses streetcars and subways.  Jenny was always easy to reach and very responsive via e-mail.  We absolutely loved this house this neighborhood (so much good food around here!) and Toronto and would recommend it to anyone!

I would definitely go back! :) "

12289410,252214917,2018-04-09,54014265,Sarah,We chose this location because it was away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We enjoyed our time in Leslieville more than the city. There are so many delicious local restaurants (definitely try the ones Chad recommends) parks and the beach is a short walk. We were skeptical to bring our dog Murphy to a city but the neighborhood is surrounded by areas where he could run. Sara and Chad provided dog bowls and even a dog bed for him. Sara and Chad were extremely accommodating and helpful hosts. Highly recommend!

Very friendly extremely accommodating and always willing to help out. the room was comfortable and a good size. Private bathroom was a bonus. A couple bus connections away from the airport and one bus ride to the Kipling Station which can take you downtown. If you're looking for a convenient location from the airport along with a good way to connect with the Subways I would recommend.

33042626,566780772,2019-11-20,191102856,Tianqi (Peter),Stayed here for a short visit in Toronto. Was good for what I needed.
21110994,237318461,2018-02-22,125929461,Daniel,"This place is very comfy and cozy if you're a fan of comforters this is it! Dive in and pass out right there...

Location is very convenient to public buses as well as commuter rail in case the subways are too slow...

For under $40 a night....best bargain in Toronto! Go for it!"
13837290,494055883,2019-07-23,275308696,Izola,Melissa and Michael were the perfect hosts.  I didn't see or hear them much but that was by choice. Their place was spotless  exactly as advertised and  fully air conditioned during the hottest heat wave to hit Toronto in a long time. Would definitely recommend and/or stay here again in the future.
32213374,513451909,2019-08-19,140922807,Sylvia,Great location and the space was clean. Unfortunately the listing states 2 king beds and a double but  it was 2 queen size beds and a double.  Only a disappointment since we are used to king size but the mattresses were very comfortable despite that.  All in all a great place to use as home base for a Toronto visit.
23597514,321942507,2018-09-11,8012076,Justin,Richard was a wonderful host. Would stay again

14488992,283279069,2018-06-29,44602799,Christina,Issa is a wondeful host. He accepted my super last-minute request to stay even though he had other guests. We had some great conversations and was happy to share what he could. He is very easy to communicate with and will give you as much private/personal space as you like. The house is perfectly located downtown Toronto. Would love to stay here again.

12977096,80486157,2016-06-18,63517449,Clare,Giselle was very considerate - although she was out of town while I was staying at her place she left water cold water bottles and snack bars in the room which were quite welcome after my long trip! Learning to navigate the bus system was a bit of a trick but once I learned to do it I was able to get into town easily from the bus stop right outside her door!
17319601,283841411,2018-06-30,97302097,Katheryn,The location was perfect! We enjoyed walking to the local cafes and being able to jump on the street car to go downtown. The apartment was clean and the bed very comfortable. Brenda was responsive and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!

20692252,222050380,2017-12-28,4460500,Abby,Beautiful space - enough rooms and space for our family of six to spread out but also hang out. Walking distance to some fun coffee shops and bars (Coffee Pocket Snakes & Lattes El Furniture Warehouse) and a short Uber ride downtown. Tullio was incredibly responsive helpful and considerate. We'd definitely stay here again!

11472952,222715105,2017-12-30,80965273,Shanika,This was a great place to stay for my first time in Canada. The apartment was rustic and unique in many ways. The exposed wood added style to the place. He had many interesting paintings and books to read. I mist say this was a great learning experience as well. I greatly appreciate the efforts in recycling and taking care of waste in Canada. We were really close to all the great things to see and do in Downtown Toronto. There’s a 5-7 minute walk to everything you need including groceries restaurants and bars. Great place to stay!
309402,7681566,2013-09-29,8697407,Chris,Christina was awesome. She accommodated me and 2 friends the best anyone could. Access to and from her apartment was super easy and her recommendations for things to do were right on point. Though we only got to interact with her twice she invited us to dinner and a night out; (we chose to decline due to other ambitions but I suspect it would have been a great time). The location of the apartment is really convenient for public transit and the rooftop pool and balcony are no joke. We came and went as we pleased and really not much could have been better.
4020596,96043864,2016-08-21,68049174,Francois,"We stayed one week in this marvelous little cabin our own private house in a green backyard in Toronto. Neighborhood very nice and close to Ossington subway station.

21739367,249044949,2018-04-01,36560326,Soha,"Greg's place was accurately described. Everything was clean. The beds (including the pull out couch) were comfortable. More than enough towels were provided. I loved that there were also dishes available for use! The furniture and decorations were impeccable. It was sweet of him to also include a small heater in addition to the already great heating system. I stayed in one room with two of my friends and we did not feel cramped at all very spacious.

The location of the place was perfect walking distance from the subway and korea town. Absolutely wonderful place!"

24380460,330370730,2018-09-30,38933985,Henrique,"Tina was very kind and gave us nice tips  about the region!
The  house is on the cellar so not so much light inside but very well equipped and clean. Beds were very comfortable. As Toronto is a very busy city it was also nice to stay a little bit away from the center as we had a rental vehicle. 
Would recommend!"
26162109,348592919,2018-11-14,48703989,Jan,Anwar is an outstanding host always wanting to help out with any issue and do his best to make sure you have everything you need.

18613986,363352703,2018-12-28,175940790,Leah,This is such a lovely space and roomier than we had expected -- we loved having the study and full bathroom and Jerry was so helpful regarding local places to go and things to do. He was also incredibly flexible and helpful with parking which can be a challenge in any city and he made sure we had not only everything we needed but also anything we might want. Ask about the amazing croissants made nearby and I recommend the breakfast tea he provided. :)
11533218,165033334,2017-06-30,125583024,Nancy,Awesome clean downtown condo with a wonderful view of the city. We came in for a concert and found this condo close to everything we needed.  The second day it was a couple minutes to drive over to Ripley's CN Tower and the Rogers Centre. While we were here we happened across a fabulous new entertainment restaurant REC ROOM at the foot of the CN tower.  Thanks Alper

29048379,540993264,2019-10-04,3977913,Ken,This was my second time in as many months as Astrid and Natalie's guest in their delightful Liberty Village home and I no longer need to look around. This is now my home from home in Toronto.  It has all the compact efficient use of space you should expect in this lively youthful neighborhood. (Think young smart professionals.) But it avoids the closed-in feel of some nearby properties. Should be quite comfortable for two; more than that and you'll want to be sure you get on well together. The high ceiling in the living room brings in plenty of light from the north with a view of a small park. And the bed is so comfortable I'm asking them where they got it because it's what I want for my own home. The kitchen is very well-stocked with cookware and dishes along with other helpful touches. Plenty of room in the refrigerator and lots of drawer space in the bedroom along with space to hang clothes (with hangers as well). The neighborhood is perfect with easy walking to groceries coffee and dining choices from fine restaurants to burritos to burgers to Tim Horton's. Close to King Street West and very easy to get to just about anywhere. The parking is only two levels down and is easy to get to and from. Astrid and Natalie are responsive and thoughtful the perfect hosts.
10682351,82004164,2016-06-26,40807710,Ryan,Excellent place to stay! Very comfortable place to come back to after a day around the city. In the heart of the restaurant/bar district.  Lots of fun places around.  Check out The Cameron House for some great tunes!

28285115,321103614,2018-09-09,1657480,Adrien,We came for the TIFF and it was the perfect place to stay. 10min drive from all the action perfectly clean quiet. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay near downtown for a reasonable price !
14576562,414018779,2019-02-18,25475007,Glenn,really nail the check-in instructions and you will be all good!

Neto also was extremely helpful in answering any questions about the place as well as to make sure my boyfriend and I were having fun in Toronto! He offered up ideas and even helped with where to eat! We would stay here again!
2478644,299720578,2018-07-31,5159472,Katrin & Kai,"Natalie & Michael’s house is really lovely. The area is completely calm but everything 
you might need is in walking distance. We felt very much home from the very beginning and would highly recommend this place to others visiting Toronto.
Street car underground leads you to city center quickly. 
Natalie was responding to my questions in a very short time and was very helpful.
It was a pity that we have not met each other. 
All in all a very good AIRBNB experience- like to wish to have on an AIRBNB place "
38794110,571720194,2019-12-01,258078304,Rachael,The host was extremely prompt with responding to any questions we had. The unit was very clean and exactly as advertised. The pool warm/cold jacuzzi and steam room/sauna were great touches. Only downfall was the elevators; 2/3 were down although the host was very apologetic and having lived in Toronto this is a very common problem for large condos.
30537622,444166636,2019-04-27,3606815,Rebeccah,We had a good stay at Lucas's apartment. Up on the 25th floor of a high-rise it was a small but cozy space with everything we needed to be comfortable and conveniently located near a subway station.

The unit was cute and cozy. We felt very welcome and comfortable here. As others mentioned there are 3 total units in the basement but we did not have any trouble with noise or anything. Everyone was extremely friendly. Julie was very accommodating with parking arrangements. This was our first time using airbnb and it was awesome. I highly recommend staying here.

15756445,505712420,2019-08-09,100821399,Richard,Location is awesome with awesome view.  Has washer and dryer in apartment. Bed was comfortable. AC was good too.   No information of ANY kind to be found in unit. You are completely on your own....especially trying to get a defective TV connection working with relatively slow response time from host.
20316532,217262028,2017-12-08,44898024,Jule,"We didnt meet Holly in person but we had a good stay. 
Its just a 5 minute walk from the subway theres a bus stop in the street too. 
45 minutes walk to the beaches and 10 minutes to the stores (supermarket bulk barn veggie and fruit stores). 
Kitchen had all the basics Holly even provided muffins milk and coffee when we arrived. Thanks for that little treat very appreciated by a late arrival.
Its in the basement so it is a little dark but everything has been fine.
I am a little sensitive to noise so I had a little trouble sleeping because you can hear the street noise (not the motor noise of the cars). But my boyfriend had no troubles at all:)
We can recommend to stay at Hollys place."

The breakfast exceeded my expectations. 
She went out of her way to help me plan my adventure. "

28543893,548392355,2019-10-17,16431498,Lukáš,The apartment is gorgeous. It is really close to everything you need (union station CN tower Billy Bishop airport lots of bars and stores). The view from the 51st floor is simply amazing. There is even a small balcony! I'm a light sleeper and I can say that I slept like a baby in this bedroom. It was comfortable a there was no noise in night whatsoever. I can only recommend this place!
26654,30093503,2015-04-17,30240680,Nicola,"Shannon-Leigh and Adel certainly ensured that my stay here was terrific: from arranging collection at the airport and a very generous bottle of wine awaiting me upon arrival at the apartment - to a phonecall the morning I left to see how my stay had been and again an arranged airport transfer. 

The apartment was in the perfect location for this visit - super close to all that the entertainment district offers and within walking distance to a number of other neighbourhoods. It is just as the images suggest - well-appointed secure clean and both cosy and surprisingly spacious. The Murphy bed is a particularly lovely touch.

I really couldn't have asked for better communication from these hosts - they were engaged quick to respond and enormously helpful at every turn."
3703115,133577785,2017-02-23,12154529,Anoojan,The pictures don't do the condo justice the view is stunning! The place is in immaculate condition and Jason ensured that the check-in/check-out process went smoothly. Definitely would stay again!  
18626396,176270754,2017-07-30,113298465,Sano,Lovely spacious room. Very comfortable bed. And generous pleasant hosts. 
11960053,448668961,2019-05-05,118212824,Dan,"Pro's: 
Alex provided excellent check instructions and provided all the information needed which minimized (eliminated) any questions during our stay. The location was excellent and the view was unmatched. I felt like we were the only people on that floor as it was very quiet.

Con's:
The bed was not very comfortable at all. I could feel springs poking me. I did not sleep much at all during my two nights. The bed was very noisy also. I could not roll over without waking up my girlfriend who did not sleep well either. 
I Could not get the TV to work.
The bathroom was not clean at all. The sink looked like it had not been wiped down in quite a while. Dust don't settle overnight. There was a hair found on the tap.  Found grime on the top edge of the wall side of the tub where the tile meets the tub. The bars of soap that were in the shower were already opened and appeared to be the same bars the previous guest may have used. The shower head was a nice looking rainfall shower type but the water pressure was so weak that my girlfriend had to put here head under the facet in the tub to get the shampoo out of her hair. I realize water pressure cannot be controlled however if this is a known issue I would suggest not using a large rainfall shower-head. I am glad my girlfriend did not look in the cabinet above the sink and find the half used bottle of vaginal lubricant and massage oil. She may have forced us to leave altogether. I am not sure what the cleaning fee actually covers but I think a little more attention to the bathroom and contents of the cabinets may be in order.

I would not stay here again"

The room had everything that I needed for my stay. The rooms in the basement are located from the opposite ends of each other which is very nice in terms of privacy.

The backyard is also a very nice place to just hangout and relax."

This is my first time to go to Toronto with a test of the mentality booked this but did not expect to encounter such a good landlord.  I hope everyone can pay more attention to this.  This is the best bed and breakfast I have ever stayed in. I will choose this one next time I go to Toronto.
19565789,278208764,2018-06-17,169668787,Katherine,Kristen’s place is fantastic: clean spacious gorgeous decor.

I’ll definitely book with her when I come back to Toronto!
732562,306483359,2018-08-12,108054828,Sherlyn,Liz has been hands down the BEST host ever !!! My husband and I were so blessed to have had Liz as our host on our trip to Canada. Her personality energy charisma and superb hosting skills definitely made us feel like we were home away from home. From the moment we arrived Liz and her son greeted my husband and I with warm hugs friendly smiles and drinks to begin our first night. Toronto was amazing but the hospitality that Liz offered us was beyond words and we truly recommend her and her place for any future travelers. Liz you out did yourself with us and we left a piece of our hearts in Toronto but we also left a piece of our hearts with you and Max <3. Thank you for all the great things you did for us and you will 100% see us again ;)

My favourite part especially was when the sun would start to set and all the beautiful colours just flowed into the rooms. The pool steam room and hot tub in the building was another favourite I loved about staying. It was great to just stay in to relax and enjoy a little spa day after the busy Caribana/ OVO Fest weekend. Peter was also very friendly and helpful when I had questions and came to aid right away! I will definitely be booking back again with Peter when I visit Toronto
31592755,526119480,2019-09-08,7117141,Olivia,"Overall great place! Host is super responsive and understanding.

The place is big and perfect for parties of 3 or more with a sweet balcony. Having parking is great. The bathroom is small and the light switch is outside.
If you are travelling by car this place is greatly situated and not too far from the cool spots in Toronto.If you are travelling by foot and want to spend time downtown I'd look for a closer place.

The fans are deceivingly loud beware. Perhaps find a cushion or way to suspend them if noise bothers you.

One little scare I had : The Quickstay check-in online.
The webpage clearly says you will not be charged however does NOT inform you that you will be charged a safety deposit (no matter the number of days you stay). They take your ID and credit card information which I found unnecessary since Airbnb has this stuff already... This should be written in the description to avoid people like me getting scared."
33141221,559014685,2019-11-03,16024397,Anita,The suite was very bright and clean and we enjoyed the beautiful bathroom and fireplace! Bernadene was extremely responsive to any questions that we had and it was a nice quiet place to stay for the weekend. Very convenient location would recommend.

21547845,271537109,2018-06-01,164458799,Alexei,I spent 10 days in Paul's apartment and I'm happy about everything. It was 15 minutes walk from my primal destination (University of Toronto). All other interesting places are easily accessible by a little bit more walking ot by the streetcar (really  at the doors of the apartment)  or by the subway.   The neighborhood is very nice and quiet the apartment is big well furnished and nicely decorated. I haven't seen the owner but the communication with him was well organized and he quickly resolved an issue at some point (which was entirely my fault in fact).  His brother lives in the house and is also very helpful.  Well the downside is that it is a basement apartment so very small windows and no view. There is also some noise from the traffic and from upstairs but quite tolerable. It did not bother me at all especially given that you are in a big city. Overall the merits of location and the apartment itself more than outweigh these little nuisances.     
21188111,428051464,2019-03-24,142272380,Aidan,Sal is a fantastic host! Check in and check out are super easy the place is very modern and super clean. Amazing location and the view is absolutely breathtaking would 100% recommend without a second thought.

14859789,199263628,2017-10-01,1457817,Christopher,"I had a wedding to go to at the Distillery District and this was the perfect location that had free parking. The room was exactly what I expected from the photos. It is extremely quiet at night. Check-in was simple. Surveillance free parking was a major selling point for me. The bed comfortably sleeps two. The main floors and kitchen are well-kept and tidy. My only tip is to moderate the internal temperature (personal preference) - it was a bit chilly at night (subjective). I highly recommend this place for those that need parking near The Beaches / Leslieville. 

Thanks Kevin and April!"
1594005,47796329,2015-09-21,19063110,Ravi,We had a wonderful time at Rahim's place. It was exactly as described and the location couldn't be more perfect. From booking to checking out he was very attentive and quick to reply to any questions we had. My friend and I were delighted to find a N64 w/ Mario Kart ready to play which made the stay that much better! I would highly recommend staying here to anyone who wants to explore the downtown Toronto area  and personally would stay here again on my next trip!
29769466,455331275,2019-05-19,176408720,Caitlin,Lily’s place was exactly as described and very clean and comfortable. I would definitely book it again!

19323816,189103071,2017-08-31,28962530,Mitchell,We had a great stay super convenient check-in (we came in at 11PM). Room and beds were ready for us when we arrived. A couple of things though: 1) There is no A/C in the room which can get really hot on hot days 2) like other reviewers have said there's a cat that isn't mentioned in the description 3) the shower is a bit broken: about half of the water comes out of the tap instead of the shower head 4) the towels didn't smell very clean. Apart from that everything was great and definitely worth the price!
13876367,226254471,2018-01-09,36012945,Laura,Ruth's place was great and I highly recommend staying with her! Although the room is in her place it feels like it's own private studio. It's very clean and has many small appliances (coffee pot refrigerator etc) you might want. Two subway stations are a short walk away to take you around the city. Ruth was a wonderful host and responded quickly to questikns. I'll be back the next time I'm in Toronto!
13565668,167100060,2017-07-05,94715074,Priyanka,It was overall nice experience . Place was same as described and Soo was prompt in replying my massages . We were fortunate to see the fireworks of CN Tower for 150 th Canada day celebration from balcony of the condo. That view was amazing.

Tara was so nice and so helpful for any touristic information. She welcomed me my wife and a friend in her beautiful house. The bed was extremely comfortable and everything was clean. The location of the house is perfect and the neighborhood so friendly. Thanks a lot!
15362533,302480402,2018-08-05,83429714,Edwin,Kevin Airbnb is fantastic is well located on a nice and calm neighborhood. It is neat and has nice touches that make you feel welcomed. He is very fast to answer any inquire and goes above and beyond in our case letting us have an early check in. If you can book his place you won't regret it.
13084226,538186113,2019-09-29,37666618,Greg,Thanks! Would stay at Joanne's place again.

14898743,116545574,2016-12-01,78804393,Daniel,"Adrienne's is a really nice place to stay. It was spotless upon our arrival and super convenient to have our own bathroom access to laundry facilities and a private side entrance. Overall I would recommend staying here if it's within your budget/location requirements but a whole month felt like a long time for my girlfriend and I. Here's why:

The bathroom was very nice but there was no shower. I enjoyed taking a bath every night but it would have been nice to grab a quick shower before work sometimes.

We were allowed to use the kitchen sometimes but it seemed like somebody was always using it. Of course this is someone else's home and we had to share the space but again it would have been nice to make dinner between 5-8pm. Lots of restaurants around though so we just went out to eat most of the time.

I think one of the biggest issues we had was the noise. This is inevitable when living with another family so I can't be too nitpicky about it. After letting the family know they were being too loud once they quieted down a bit for a day or two and then started arguing loudly again. It was pretty much non-stop bilingual bickering and/or dishes clanging around at early/late hours and stairs being stomped on above us. Luckily the house is in a nice quiet neighbourhood so we could just go for a relaxing walk instead of eavesdropping. The separate entrance was handy for this as well! Families argue I get it. And it's not our place to tell them to stop. So we dealt with it how we saw fit not a huge deal. Just beware of staying here if you don't like upstairs noise.

Definitely no complaints where the bed is concerned. The bed was comfortable I always had a great sleep on it and there were plenty of blankets and pillows. The only problem (aside from any noise during sleeping hours) would be the temperature of the basement. There was a heater downstairs which was pretty effective and tea and a kettle were provided too which was very nice to keep us warm!

Overall this place is a 4/5 experience. The basement is very nice and the entire family upstairs is extremely hospitable and did as much as they could to make sure we had a wonderful stay (which we did)! It's just unfortunate there were so many downsides or else we might have stayed longer. I recommend this place to anyone who doesn't mind some sound from upstairs. Thanks Adrienne and family!"
16860374,144070004,2017-04-14,78667382,Emily,This place was beyond amazing! Went to Toronto for a Blue Jays trip and it was the best location! Maya left hidden touches throughout the place. So so so clean! Just great! I will for sure be staying there again as I go for many Jays trip 
25768147,312512924,2018-08-23,136960188,Tyler,getting the key but wasn't too big of a deal and Farid helped out despite being on vacation himself. Overall a great experience and I would do it all over again.

23594964,457685763,2019-05-24,3245158,Lianne,"Overall we had a decent stay in this condo - its in a great location within walking distance of quite a few of Toronto's main attractions like the Rogers Stadium. The area is great for restaurants and bars too. The apartment had originally been decorated to a high standard in modern design. Check in and check out was smooth and communication was quick and responsive.

We had a few minor issues like a broken cooker hob evening noise from neighbours no TV remote and the apartment has had some other wear and tear. 

However our main concern was being asked by the hosts to be dishonest to the security guards at reception about us being Airbnb guests (presumably as it isn't permitted in this block). This made for some awkward interactions when more than once we were identified as non residents and challenged about what we were doing there. We felt under scrutiny every time we came and left the building which put a dampener on an otherwise relaxing and enjoyable stay in Toronto"
31762097,422648773,2019-03-11,245166781,Cristian,This is a great place very good host  thank you!
6385830,97851618,2016-08-28,661085,Margaret,"Maryrose's ""Sky Pad"" in Toronto is a wonderful space to stay while enjoying Toronto. The apartment is fully equipped with anything you'd need during a short or extended stay.  
Maryrose was very accommodating with a late check-in & out due to the scheduling of our flights. We appreciated it and it made our stay seamless and more enjoyable.
I would definitely recommend Maryrose's Sky Pad and will return when I visit Toronto again."

25306646,522804433,2019-09-02,35997922,Laura,"Ivan's place is absolutely incredible! Immaculately designed with very unique touches. Not a bland boring space that's for sure has lots of personality (no more boring white sterile walls haha) Also we loved and appreciated how clean and organized it was. Location to the distillery district was only a 10-15 min walk which was also a bunch of fun! 
They also have bikes to rent all around the city for $3.25/30 mins and can drop off right down the street from his place! Views from the 17th floor are incredible overlooking the waterfront and surrounding area as well. Highly recommended Ivan as a host and his beautiful home. Make sure to take great care of it and appreciate his great style and fashion sense! A+++"
20696761,270534786,2018-05-29,184820988,Molly,Rainbow was a great host! I would definitely stay at her place again. Good driving distance to downtown so it was a good spot as well. Merci Rainbow! Je reviendrais chez vous! :)
21259494,205628748,2017-10-22,153979545,Josh,Was a great last minute deal very close to public transportation and just outside of downtown. The markets and shops were of fresh food and so much to choose from pairing was manageable which is pretty good considering the city life. Oliver was very helpful and in constant communication made us feel at home and provided anything we may have needed. 10 out of 10!!

28886113,336541871,2018-10-14,111171947,Shaadi,Honestly we thought the pictures were cool before we saw the space but once we arrived I was so overwhelmed by how GORGEOUS the space was that I barely noticed Michael who was showing us the space before Kingi arrived. Almost immediately upon showing interest in the space Kingi replied to us which was very professional and she continued to communicate with us during out stay. This was the COOLEST airbnb experience I have ever had. Above all Kingi and Michael were some  of the kindest most easy going people I have ever met. They were extremely welcoming and outstanding hosts with a perfect space. If you are looking for a bland boring stay this is not the place for you but if you love character art and friendly hosts book right now!!!

Art was responsive to all of our questions. We'd absolutely stay here again. 

Note that it's on the 2nd floor of a house so you'll have to carry your suitcases up the stairs. We stayed in December. The heat was fine but I can't speak to what it would be like on a hot August day."

31143204,561469373,2019-11-09,46041265,Leslie,"Overall the space is well located and well furnished. 

There is a fully stocked kitchen (pots pans dishes cutlery utensils) so if you don't feel like eating out you always have the option of cooking as well. There are two bathrooms which is a plus. If you're staying with more than 2 guests it makes for an easier time to get ready in the morning. The beds were comfortable and cozy! If you're not driving there is a bus stop right outside the front and it is a 15 minute ride to the closest subway station. There are also lots of shops and restaurants nearby making the area very walkable."

34649647,493472669,2019-07-22,49549656,Madison,"Staying with Amy and Brett was an absolute pleasure of mine and I can’t rave more about the experience I had staying with them in their beautiful home! 

Location: 

- This location has a free parking spot in front of the home which was very convenient for distance travellers such as myself. 

-I also found myself using the street car (under a 10 min walk) to get easily downtown for more exploring. The ride is about 40 min from Union but feels much shorter as you find your eyes drifting to see all of the small and interesting shops that pack Toronto’s streets.

The Unit/Amenities: 

- The basement has high ceilings which is almost unheard of for some Toronto homes. I found it so nice and private. The windows let in plenty of light which made the unit feel nice and open. Not to mention it stayed nice and cool in this summer heat!

- I cannot be more impressed with the Unit as it is newly renovated with stainless steel appliances a large L-shaped couch across from a flat screen TV beautiful shower and minimalistic decorating. I was nervous about the Murphy bed at first but it was completely sturdy and didn’t have any creaking when you’re rolling around in bed! Super cozy!

- The kitchen is FULLY equipped was every little thing you might need if you’re planning on cooking a lot of your meals. Even sweet little extras that you wouldn’t think about when you’re packing to travel.

- The bathroom had plenty of clean towels and wash cloths at your disposal along with a complimentary dove soap with shampoo and conditioner as well! The blow dryer also came in handy.

Cleanliness:

- I couldn’t spot anything that was a concern at all in this unit! 

Details:

- The lovely little details Amy and Brett put into this unit made my stay that much more special. They had put together a little fruit and snack bowl for myself and my guest with a hand written note welcoming us to their home. 

-They had a binder filled with every little thing you might wonder about the unit like the Internet where to take the garbage checking in and out etc etc. Along side some information about the beaches area with some extra towels if you wanted to take a walk to the beach! 

Hosts:

- I had the pleasure meeting with Amy for a chat not long after checking in. She was extremely welcoming and kind which made my stay feel much more homey and comfortable. She let me know about the area and her favourite places to eat if I wanted to take a walk around.

All in all if you’re looking for a cozy and comfortable stay look no further than Amy and Brett’s. They’ll absolutely take care of everything you need and make sure your stay is nothing less than amazing! (There’s no doubt in my mind I’ll be rebooking with them again)!!!!"
21739367,325052633,2018-09-18,939134,Ren & Nick,Perfect for the 3 of us. Unusual building but stylish studio and fantastic location. Was sweltering when we arrived but the AC did a good job.

28204634,561458641,2019-11-09,161931382,Nadi,"The place is great neat and clean. Expect it's a little cozy; if you or your fellow travellers 6'4"" or taller the location may not be an ideal match."
23003720,268622526,2018-05-25,167626128,Marian,Very reasonable and a great location. Lob laws and the LCBO are in the same building and there were plenty of near by restaurants. It was handy to the subway which we took advantage of to go to the theatre. Parking was included which is a bonus in Toronto.
36879409,552417958,2019-10-21,70615208,Sara,"Beautiful apartment in the heart of downtown location. 

It does get a bit chilly in the nighttime but during the day there is lots of sunlight. 

Owner is very responsive and helpful. 

Considering this is downtown it is very quiet and peaceful during the night.

24958745,573570720,2019-12-06,1624442,Faraaz,"Sandra's unit was great and cozy. It was right across from Whole foods and in a neighbourhood with great options. Further I never had to drive any where as everything was close enough to walk.

The bed was extremely comfy and the Nespresso maker with extra pods was a welcomed addition as I didn't need to venture into the snow for my morning coffee."
9006735,97462030,2016-08-27,216993,Eileen,Eric has been a wonderful host from arrival to departure. He welcomed us with warm greetings but also made sure to give us enough privacy during our time there. The entire stay at Eric's was comfortable. He was helpful and more than willing to share his 2 cents on where to go and what to eat. The accommodation is conveniently located to the subway station which takes you downtown really quick. There's also supermarket and diners in the area. Highly recommended!

It felt as though I found my second home especially with the dog who likes to hide under the couch. Everything was pleasant and breakfast every morning was deliciously prepared!

20745798,516592261,2019-08-24,13022868,Eric,"Jason is  very welcoming and an amzing host (So a real super host !).
The apartement is locted in the center of Toronto which makes everything easily reachable (you can walk to many places from there) otherwise the subway station is 5 minutes away.
The room is a bit small but ok for a single person. It can just be a little bit noisy since the walls are not that thick. 
It's really nice to have a balcony the view from there is amazing ! 
So I definitly enjoyed my stay at Jason's place !"
15521852,189718767,2017-09-02,33363216,Kiet,"This is my best travel experience so far. The room turned out to be even better in style and decor comparing to the depicted photos on the Airbnb website with a wonderful backyard where I can sit and enjoy the sunlight. The common living room and dining room were large and comfortable the kitchen was well-equipped and the house was well-maintained and located in a quiet neighborhood. All was spotlessly clean and the towels were generously supplied. The additional cleaning services was an bonus. 
The house is located in the middle of Toronto where I can explore both downtown area and also cabbagetown area ( I can walk to all the main attractions!)
Moreover the host was so hospitable and thoughful. Emily's Uncle was always responsive to my messages. He also went to dinner with me and gave me all the answers advices i needed.
My only regret is that my stay should be a bit longer even when I have stayed there for two months ! :)
Thank you again Ms. Emily and Mr. Allen!
Kevin"
11341816,270121854,2018-05-28,48054157,Sarah,We enjoyed our stay in Toronto very much - this is a great location with easy access to the city.  The balcony was nice to access outside and the space was comfortable for me and my two teenage daughters.

31663391,426956564,2019-03-22,110924413,Jonathon,Great spot enjoyed the island airport view perfectly clean. Only (minor) downside was the beds weren’t the best. The check in process was the best I’ve ever had in an air bnb and was simple as could be. Huge points for that. Only reason for 4 stars in value is bc cleaning fees chap my arse. All around I would absolutely come back. Thank you again.

29904200,348885784,2018-11-15,183511102,Vyacheslav,"Amazing! If you love height and views this was the best place we could imagine in Toronto.  Plus facilities in building: gym pool sauna.  In terms of kitchen bedrooms bathrooms no issue everything was fine. 
Strongly recommended:)"

Walking distance from the subway station that takes you directly into the city in short periods of time and the accessibility is outstanding! Excellent place for anyone planning a vacation!
13922450,260380099,2018-05-04,14834262,Carly,"I have now had the privilege of staying with Gwen and Tam several times but this time was even better then all of the rest put together. They are not only the best Airbnb hosts I have ever had they are the most geniune people you can imagine who truly care about the experience their guests have.  

This loft in particular has been one of my favourites where I got to spend the better half of 2 weeks during a business trip.  The space is decorated so beautifully with all of the perfect finishing touches.  It truly is an inspirational space.  

It is also incredibly close to union station as well as all other main stations and was super easy to get a taxi anytime I needed one.  

The loft has everything you could possibly need to have a more than comfortable stay - I loved being able to cook do laundry and watch Netflix (on the odd occasion I was home) and sometimes all at the same time! Small details really matter and this for me is such a rarity when it comes to business travel but one that Tam and Gwen have perfected.  

I truly appreciated how flexible they were to accommodate by hectic schedule and will forever be grateful for their generosity. Thank you thank you thank you (I have already recommended you to several colleagues!)."
18154899,207993171,2017-10-30,30698211,Melissa,This place was absolutely perfect for my stay. You couldn't find better in a hotel. Great location and loved the privacy of the basement suite it was immaculate and super cozy. Thanks Andrew I'll be back!

My room was clean and comfy with lots of natural light - the 3 pillows were especially a plus! I also  appreciated how easy and seamless the check-in and check-out processes were.
2634306,47323814,2015-09-17,27844510,Johannes,Great host rooms exactly as described. one of the best locations in Toronto!
29493659,470003609,2019-06-15,3651322,Wendy,Megan's place is true to the pictures. The basement is beautifully renovated with many nice touches. It's close to the Toronto Congress Centre and Megan includes parking. While we did not meet Megan in person communication was great and she responded quickly to  questions and concerns.
39331301,565530735,2019-11-17,19546516,Penelope Ngawara,Beautiful colourful creatively decorated little apartment. I was alone for the most part but this would be ideal for a single business traveller or couple staying in Toronto. The buses are nearby and ubers are easy to get into the city as well as transport links to the airport if you need them. The area is bohemian and up and coming so if you like East London in the UK youd love this. I was able to get a really good nights sleep. The street is quiet and I felt fine coming home even late at night. Highly recommend. thanks Patrice and Jeff!
14662932,338435839,2018-10-19,193492378,Fenneke,Very clean and charming apartment. Perfect location supermarket and Subway around the corner. Would stay again!

16425784,231963228,2018-02-03,134739310,Matthew,Good stay. Lots of space. In an older building but updates have been done where they were needed. Very much in Chinatown so expect that. 
11960053,262675931,2018-05-09,175592633,Andrea,Great space. Close walk to many sites (metro convention center Rogers center can tower etc)... only challenging thing is there is only one key so if multiple people are staying you need to come/go at same time (but still worked well).
33434259,458131635,2019-05-25,69790971,Noah,"Awesome place awesome view awesome host. 

The apartment itself is a bit larger than the pictures make it out to be. The place was sparking clean and the view is just amazing. The beds were decently comfy and the decor was clean and simple. The balcony is quite small and has no furniture but it was great for our purposes. The kitchen even came with solo cups shot glasses pans/dishes and plenty of coffee cream and sugar “for the hangover.” 

Our host Tristan was a really cool guy and obviously worked hard to make sure we had a good time. He knew exactly what this place would be used for and told us all about his favourite clubs and bars downtown and made sure to let us know how to find the pool/gym. He was very accommodating even when our group was running late and communication was speedy.

Overall I would highly recommend this apartment and have already convinced a friend to book it next month. This is a rare gem."
18967545,542491710,2019-10-06,273508049,Snezana,I worked with Julie the entire time and she was extremely helpful. She gave us directions that were super easy to follow to park and to get into our room. Responses were quick and was there anytime we needed anything. Place itself is awesome. Perfect for two. View was amazing. Noise and sun were not an issue. Definitely would stay here again!!!

Nous n'avons malheureusement pas pu rencontrer David mais il était très disponible et s'assurait qu'on ne manquait de rien.
Il avait prévu aussi un petit mur sur lequel il avait accroché quelques pages d'un guide un plan du réseau de transport et sa liste de restaurants/bars où aller.

Thanks a lot David if we have an opportunity to go back to Toronto we will ask again for your appartment. "

Sylvia was very helpful as it was my first time using airbnb and she graciously responded to all of my questions. The list that she left of neighbourhood restaurants and other amenities was very helpful.  The kitchen is fantastic if you enjoy cooking and there are many great places to purchase food in the area. We had lots of room for the four of us and would love to come back in the summer to enjoy the lovely outdoor space. I would highly recommend this listing!
"
13083546,161074956,2017-06-16,127223124,Chaim,House was everything we hoped for and more. It was our home away from home during our time in Toronto. Lots of sleeping space living space and plenty of bathrooms. The fenced in backyard was a great hit with our grandchildren. Communication with our host was easy and he responded quickly. 
36356722,512690640,2019-08-18,279833512,Kyra,Mars’ place was lovely. The room is spacious with a nice private bath and the apartment itself is tidy with lovely views of Bay st.

9294881,74718735,2016-05-16,10548748,Chiemi,The house is right next to the subway station and there's an express train station to Toronto Pearson International Airport. Ece Matt and Luma made me feel super comfortable and I had an amazing stay!

27220728,561078559,2019-11-08,31853976,Catherine,Nice appartment.
16005226,151624365,2017-05-13,126153890,志远,The room is clean and nice. But it only has  one bed for two people and a small sofa bed which is not comfortable for sleep. The host is friendly and response quickly but still it is hard to sleep in the sofa bed. The apartment is near the union station but a little far from the downtown (Eaton center). It is a good place for two people but not for three. 
16420888,164788084,2017-06-29,39934023,Laura,The apartment was quiet and we had everything we needed. A great place to stay in down town Toronto. Very clean places near by to eat and a  comfortable place to sleep. We enjoyed our stay.

19593508,484817287,2019-07-09,1553421,Dara,"This place is terrific! The location is great for getting everywhere AND the apartment itself is so nice! We were two adults and two kids and it was very comfortable. It seems almost new down to the super-clean towels. There's parking which is awesome and even secure bike parking!
The host lives above but was total unobtrusive. Rather Andrea was just responsive and helpful throughout. We would definitely stay again."

The only thing we couldn’t work out was the tv...but that didn’t matter. It said there was a way to connect to Netflix but we couldn’t find it.

Great breakfast place just down the street called Portland Variety and plenty of dinner restaurants on the same road."
43964,155725389,2017-05-28,131443614,Ally,This was my first time using airbnb and Mitra was a great host to my boyfriend and I. She was very accomodating communicated very well with us and made us feel right at home. If we return to Toronto we will definitely stay with Mitra again. I would recommend this place to any of my family and friends. It was less than a 10 minute drive to the subway station which made the commute to Toronto super easy. The apartment was so organized and tidy she even had a little goodie basket waiting for us when we arrived. I have nothing bad to say about this airbnb and definitely enjoyed my stay :)
17157293,489385186,2019-07-16,240733556,Seona,We stayed for one night. The room was fine. Random men’s clothing in the closet...we will leave it at that.

20902125,346390020,2018-11-08,64274108,Richard,An immaculate space located by all the shops and restaurants the Danforth has to offer and a short walk away from the nearest subway station into downtown. Luggage storage on arrival/departure at the business downstairs was very much appreciated as was assistance with check in when collecting the key. Frank was immediately available should any query occur so all in all an excellent stay.
22797028,364437923,2018-12-30,59373494,Marisa,The place was clean easy check-in and communication in a great area with walking distance to everything you want and I felt very safe in the apartment building! I’d highly recommend and know where I want to stay next time I’m in town!
16993068,406177166,2019-01-28,50162499,Zain,I’ve stayed at a few different Airbnb locations in Downtown Toronto and I can definitely say this was the best one. Marissa has done an amazing job with the decor the location of this apartment was perfect the view from the balcony was great and the check in process was a breeze. Marissa was prompt in her responses to all my questions and was patient with me even though the questions I asked were clearly explained in the notes I got before checking in! She is a spectacular host. I can’t say enough good things about Marissa. You can tell she values her guests. I will definitely stay here again!
6274443,36691008,2015-06-30,19204442,Alexander,Mike's Place was a great place to stay! Just as described it was spacious and comfortable! Its is in a great location with a TimHortons and other restraunts across the street. Access to the CNE grounds and Molson Canadian Ampetheatre are a few short steps away! Would definatly recomend to friends and family!

13081577,134246105,2017-02-26,78066323,Steven,Desirée was a very welcoming host.  Although we did not meet in person everything was setup as promised and we had a very good experience renting this apartment.  I would recommend this as a place to stay while in Toronto.  Very quiet neighbourhood and great for sleeping!  Thanks again!
14471969,323048807,2018-09-14,30719853,Solange,Shawn's place is fantastic and a great location too! He had a parking spot ready for us which was incredible handy since parking is a bit tricky in the area. Check in and check out process was incredible smooth. The condo was very clean and large enough for 2 people (although you could probably fit a few more on the Murphy bed). Shawn was quick to respond to our questions and he checked in every now and see if we had any questions. Would definitely stay here again! Highly recommend!
29954526,521986997,2019-09-01,134878859,Tyler,Great spot  very clean and comfortable stay. Check in was as easy as could be with a door code and private entrance. Excellent location would stay here again in a heartbeat when down in the city.

11533218,482048245,2019-07-06,125583477,Shailin,Host was unresponsive during the day of check-in. I had a one night stay and I couldn't get in touch with the host despite multiple attempts to reach out to him. Would not recommend.
1989937,86276244,2016-07-15,3730640,Sheerin,Fantastic stay at Francisco's apartment for 2 nights. Walkable to tons of restaurants and bars on King Street but also a 20 min walk to the harbour / CN tower and general walking around. The apartment was clean stylish & well laid out. Not to forget the terrace was fabulous for breakfast and hanging out. 5* accommodation for 4 people on 2 sofa beds and a double. Thanks for putting us up and for the speedy responses!

39969759,565516116,2019-11-17,33695015,Chris,"Sarah was very pleasant and was accessible during our stay. The unit overall was just average and could  do with an overhaul in decor/  furnishings. We didn't spend much time in the unit so it wasn't as big a deal for us.

Be aware that you at on top of the subways and will hear and feel the trains coming and going. Also a lot of floor noise and creaking can be heard from the adjacent unit particularly in the bedroom."
19460610,273574553,2018-06-06,25166530,Gonzalo,Awesome location and cozy place! 
9651151,160519331,2017-06-14,105727870,Annika,Wat een geweldige bnb ontzettend vriendelijk ontvangst door Harry! Wat voelden we ons welkom vanaf het eerste moment.  Harry is een goede host zeer gastvrij en vol goede adviezen! We hebben echt genoten. Distillery district is 5 minuten lopen en wij hadden fietsen gehuurd waarmee je zo in het centrum zit. Geweldige locatie appartement was netjes en schoon! Een plek waar we terug komen en zullen aanbevelen! Bedankt Harry!
11908666,72373261,2016-05-02,47889513,Michael,Great location both he and his girlfriend were very accommodating... The apartment looks exactly like the pictures and the views were a site... No television in the place but that made me explore the city being a first time visitor. I would love to stay again
148945,189069290,2017-08-31,45121196,Alia,Best stay ever. The hosts are great very generous and helpful and accommodating. They did their best to make me feel comfortable and happy. The location is great and walking distance to many great places like distillery district and st. Laurence market. The room was like in the pics big bed and comfy couch and tv. It was a great experience.
2964842,184406724,2017-08-19,127199187,Alessandra,Deanna apartment is very nice and clean. It's close to the metro Spadina (10 minute walking) and not too far from the city centre (about 30 minute by foot). I will suggest it!

22290706,281502751,2018-06-25,23750021,Juliana,"A casa eh dividida em units. Todas com entradas independentes. Nem cheguei a entrar na minha por causa do mau entendimento do anfitriao. Fiquei para fora e irritada. Cancelei meus outros dias e estou na briga agora. Pelo que conheci da parte de fora o quintal esta cheio de ratos. O odor e a bagunca que senti e vi nao me deixaram impressionada ao ver ratos enquanto buscava um hotel no celular. O corredor que leva a porta nao tem luz. Nem dava para ver onde estava pisando. Meus filhos ficaram com ""medo"" do local e decidimos nao voltar mais la. O anfitriao nao foi muito sensato talvez nao imagina o que é estar com duas criancas em um pais diferente pela primeira vez e nao ter ideia da onde ir as 2 da manha. Minha experiencia foi pessima com esse anfitriao e agora estou esperando que o airbnb ajude-me a recuperar meu enorme prejuizo."

270330,54046752,2015-11-15,48347311,Isaiah,My wife and I had a great stay thanks to Tricia and Mark. We were greeted when we arrived to the site and shown where to park. The site was cozy and welcoming. The communication with our host was great. They responded to questions before our stay and answered a question or two before we left. Being from the U.S. it was helpful to use the WiFi to figure out plans via (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps when our data was turned off on our cell phones. The location to Air Canada Centre Eaton Centre and other items was great to walk to. Having on site parking was extremely helpful for our stay. 
15649505,413986955,2019-02-18,140258393,Romane,Jay place was beautiful

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking to stay in the north York area.

As well she was very quick to respond to any questions and prop with eating us with everything that we required."
5069604,102053583,2016-09-16,25262627,Ashley,Jimi is a amazing host! From providing us information before our trip even started to making sure we had a smooth and easy transition into the apartment. It was great! We decided to stay for three days instead of just two and we definitely don't regret it. This is definitely the cutest and coolest air bnb I've ever stayed in. Super close to everything! It's in a very hip neighborhood with hip bars and restaurants near by and very conveniently located to downtown by walking. Will definitely be staying here again!

17699190,423266467,2019-03-13,120494093,Marc,Hübsches Zimmer mit Bad in fantastischer Lage. Die Kommunikation mit Pam ist super einfach: klar schnell ausführlich. Der Retro-Stil mit ein bisschen Shabby Chic ist Geschmacksache und insgesamt würde die eine oder andere Ecke von einem kleinen Upgrade profitieren. Aber für den Preis ist die Unterkunft insgesamt prima.
4510872,174945032,2017-07-27,131347156,Frederic,Notre séjour a été parfait le condo était tel que décris dans l'annonce j'y retourner assurément!!!

32005538,503247209,2019-08-05,59395945,Qaitlin,"I had a fantastic time celebrating my birthday with my family here. 

Originally I was disappointed as the pool was closed for the duration of my stay but Ida and Paul were so accommodating and kind that they gave me a discount. They were also very flexible and allowed us a later check out which was very kind.

The place in itself was spotless and absolutely beautiful. Also the bed was the comfiest bed I've ever slept on - seriously amazing!

My family and I stayed in and cooked dinner (the kitchen is incredible!!) and watched Netflix with the balcony door open; it was so perfect.

We all wished we were staying longer than just one night and we hope to come back in the future."

After arriving later than anticipated he was more than accommodating and happy to answer any questions I had during my stay. The apartment is well located and public transport is easily accessible. There are also many small cafes nearby and a convenience store right across the road which came in very handy.

10489621,75013383,2016-05-18,7326742,Adam,"Lately renting through Airbnb was starting to feel more and more like hotels. The spirit and community feel of staying in another's home in another city was starting to be overtaken by business investment style units. Increasingly the prices were moving in that direction as well. 
Brittany and Adam's place was the exact opposite of that! It really felt like being hosted by someone. The place was homey and had a warm inviting feel. The pictures don't do the place justice! The place was more than spacious especially for just one person and filled with light. The terrace outside made a world of difference! 

I didn't have the pleasure to meet Brittany or Adam unfortunately as they were away but communication and checking in were a breeze. 

The area was perfect in Little Italy. Just steps from transportation. Centrally located yet far enough from the downtown core that you don't have to worry about the hustle and business. Located on a quiet residential street lined with beautiful trees and friendly neighbours. 

This is by far the best Airbnb experience I've had in a very long time and thank Brittany and Adam for their amazing hospitality. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Toronto and will definitely try to stay there next time I'm in town if it's available."

27550586,562898441,2019-11-11,75131782,Chloe,This place located between Queen st and Dundas st so it's really very convenient to get around in down town. You can get to the Dundas subway Eaton mall by 5 mins walking or you can take the streetcar on Queen st to Chinatown in 10 mins. The apartment is small but tidy and clean (good for 2 people). The only thing is there's no heat in kitchen area so it's really cold if you stayed out there even in the washroom. Other than that everything is perfect. Huan is a good host!!

The location is 6min to subway by walking and you can find a big supermarket by 10mins' walking. It is convenient and quiet . We enjoyed those days...thank you Laurel and Graham.

20309933,420065658,2019-03-05,39853692,David,"Ashli's place was perfect. Clean convenient comfortable and affordable. Exactly as advertised. We were a family of 4 and it was just what we needed. Takes about 30-40 minutes to get downtown by public transit. You can buy transit fares around the corner at a place called ""Mr. Cheap."" Starbucks is across the street if you're in a pinch for a snack or coffee but beware that it closes at 8pm. Ashli was on the ball and communicated very well. Check-in was easy. I think our only request would be a couple of more blankets. Overall thumbs-up!"
15409864,163117194,2017-06-23,85548714,Janette,This is a great place to stay in beautiful Toronto. Easily sleeps 2 adults and child or teenager. Everything you need is here. You will love it

37046399,569423333,2019-11-26,162373009,Anne Marie,A small apartment with an excellent location the parking is a bonus in that part of Toronto.  It is clean and we appreciated having a washer dryer and dishwasher.  Our only issue was with the uncomfortable seating in the living room.  Andy was responsive to any questions we had and quick to respond.  The neighbours are quiet.  We would recommend it.
21982595,290040876,2018-07-13,6658200,Sebastian,The place was as in the description and we all felt very welcomed. The rooms were nice and the kitchen was well equipped. Wifi worked well. Only downside was that the street just outside the house is a bit noisy and has lots of traffic so it was a bit difficult to sleep in the room facing the front with the noise. But other than that everything was great!
22065289,499528483,2019-07-31,12763940,Frederic,"Perfect location.
Easy to access and with a parking which is very useful in Toronto"
11135880,468528295,2019-06-12,2574035,Zahra,Great place and excellent location. Fully equipped kitchen and laundry facilities. I had to order some things online and Abi accepted to receive it during the week before we arrived!
17682376,258176462,2018-04-28,165722345,Manuel,The room was just as in the pictures very near of several places walking/bus. just there were noises late at night and since the walls are very thin I woke up few times at night. Also the wifi signal was very low from my room.
13139555,349467796,2018-11-17,4923645,Cynthia,The place is as it appears in the photos.;  There were many small thoughtful touches like phone chargers ear plugs portable heater fruit & flowers tea and etc.  The food recommendations were very good and the community is lovely and there are lots of amenities.   The fantastic beach and boardwalk are a minute away. The bed pillows and bedding were great.  Carlos was helpful and responsive with messages prior to our arrival and accommodating on our arrival date.  All in all we had a very good stay and really loved the wonderful location.

It’s very nice for a family of 4. 

I had a very easy and good communication all the time with David who is very kind and responsable.

Plenty of room in the condo  and safe neighborhood.  The condo has great views from the patio. Julie was VERY quick with her communication which is very important. I would highlyrecommend and I would definitely stay again.

We had the chance to try out the gym which was a nice amenity to have access to! Krisitina was an amazing host. She responded quickly to any questions and even left us a nice bottle of wine! I would definitely recommend her condo!
23166623,452031713,2019-05-12,257381399,Joanne,The condo was clean and in an excellent location walking distance to the most popular attractions. The space is tight (we were 3 sisters with large suitcases) but it is do able if you are out all day and don't mind moving things around before going to bed.  The key transfer and communication with Sal went smoothly.
26569660,555297198,2019-10-27,119807560,Instructor,This location was excellent! It's centrality to down town made it easy to find resources and entertainment without much hassle the cleanliness of the space made it immediately comfortable and enjoyable and the view of the city was quite inspirational. Dolly's clear and quick responses made the stay ease on organization and allowed us to focus on our reasons for our stay in Toronto -this is easily a strong recommendation for the stay in this space.
21160812,487081915,2019-07-13,29765200,Jean,Iris' place has an amazing view.  The locale is perfect for getting around where I needed to go--everything was within walking distance (good shops eateries and walking distance to my business training conference.)  Iris was very accommodating incredibly prompt with communication and stayed in communication with me when I had questions throughout my stay.  The place was quiet and clean and the self-checkout was straightforward and easy.  Wish all Airbnb hosts were as accessible and communicative as Iris.  Highly recommend this locale!
2721128,289529270,2018-07-12,175572382,Esteban,Its a good place it has all you need the bed can be easilly changed in to a full size bed. But is kind of cold
22856879,522033515,2019-09-01,71143331,Annie,We had an amazing experience!! The location is literally perfect in a cute little quiet neighborhood but just a small walk to the main drag with everything on it! These guys did an amazing job at getting back to me quickly and even went out of their way to help me add a few surprise touches for my boyfriends birthday! Not to mention the place was so cute and cozy and super clean! We loved it and definitely plan on coming back! We highly recommend :)

37055198,522841337,2019-09-02,57759975,Matthew,Great location at a great rate if you want to be near the lake in a full amenity building the only downside is public transportation is a walk but if you are driving this place is perfect.
12301555,166102558,2017-07-02,49084176,Shelley,This condo was perfect for our night in Toronto. It was clean and in a very good location for us to get to Union Station the CN Tower the Rogers Centre and a variety of restaurants. The hosts were able to answer our questions in a timely manner and were helpful in answering my questions. I would definitely return in the future.
812922,50970363,2015-10-16,23614794,Richard,Sandra was a great host with an amazing breakfast in the morning with fresh muffins and coffee! The neighbourhood was in a nice location close to many shops and places to eat.

6104093,459559201,2019-05-27,37705987,Peter,Suzy's  place is an L-shaped studio apartment - a well thought out space -  in the eastern  part of Toronto called Leslieville - a very relaxed family friendly neighborhood.   It  was sparkling clean with a very comfortable bed and everything one might need in the kitchen.   It's less than half a block to Queen St with its many shops and restaurants  and where you can catch the streetcar downtown.   Good neighborhood for bike riding too.   All in all a great place to stay..
3939840,123952231,2016-12-31,18052328,Shary,Darren & Derek's place is so well organized. It honestly felt like home they had everything for us even cards to play! The studio is so well put together Darren & Derek are well hosts that ensured we had everything even a alarm clock!

2455129,20139667,2014-09-24,1760917,George,My wife and I had a 4-night stay at Kate's condo during a combined business and pleasure visit to Toronto. Knowing that we would be arriving a little after noon Kate allowed us to check in early so that we could secure our luggage in the unit and go off on a walking tour of the Southcore. She texted several times during our stay to make sure everything was to our liking which it was. Kate is an attentive host who maintains a very clean attractive condo in a great location. Convenient access to public transportation a Tim Horton's across the street and a wonderful supermarket about a block north on York St are among the many things we appreciated about this stay. Thanks again Kate!
17478107,443692105,2019-04-26,17503937,Gobind,We stay with Judith everyone time we go to Toronto.  Her places are so popular we now have to book well in advance.  This unit is extremely spacious and very comfortable.  If you want to eat in everything you need is in the kitchen.  We love the neighborhood with all the shops and restaurants on the Danforth and wonderful coffee shops very close by.  This is the 6th time we have stayed with Judith and hope to keep returning to our home away from home.
4510872,128419001,2017-01-24,6735069,Jason,Cheryl And Devan’s place was AMAZING! From the location to the view I enjoyed my short stay. I would recommend Cheryl And Devan’s place and would love to stay there again on my next visit to Toronto.

29782022,442535577,2019-04-23,120281427,Anna,Clean well equipped reasonably priced and very well located place. The only thing one should be careful about is that there are many guest rooms and the walls are very thin so you'll hear everyone talking inside the house :)
34749823,527306159,2019-09-10,2442118,Elliott,Great place! Stayed for a work trip and loved the experience
24965151,324119321,2018-09-16,97557930,Clive,Bryan’s place is as described on the site. It is easy to access and Bryan was both a responsive and accommodating host who answered queries immediately. There is a great supermarket about a 2 minute walk away and the Brazen Head bar is also very close. Downtown is a straightforward walk which took us around 35 minutes. Cab ride back is about $18 from St Lawrence Market area. I would stay here again if I was back in the area. You also have use of a pool and a well equipped gym.
21066913,258615679,2018-04-29,92507339,Stephanie,Erika’s place is just a hop and a skip away from all kinds of nice restaurants and a stone throws away from downtown by car. As mentioned in the listing it is a sofa bed (more on the hard side) in a cozy room with basic amenities. The bathroom was spacious with a vanity and heated towel rack. There were also toiletries that were provided. The tenant upstairs was noisy each night but we contacted Erika and she responded quickly and took care of the issue.
16195283,204128718,2017-10-16,26032583,Vanessa,Sisi and Jhon's place is centrally located and has amazing view of city of Toronto. It's within walking distant to CN Tower and others attractions in the city. The apartment is clean and bright with modern amenities. Sisi and Jhon sent us detailed check-in and parking instructions with videos. Make sure you watch the videos and following the instructions carefully and you should have no problem self-checking in to their place. Thank you for hosting Sisi and Jhon!
25895879,311574138,2018-08-21,190698090,Jade,Very nice apartment at a great location. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. The only downside is the host. Carla seemed unprofessional. She came to meet us with her friends and a bag from the LCBO. We shared an elevator with her and her fiends but got off by ourselves. Carla didn’t show us to the room  she only gave us the keys and instructions on where to find the apartment. On our last day when we were supposed to check out at 11 am she came in to the apartment at 7 am which woke us up and made us believe someone was breaking in. It scared both of us. After she left the apartment she messaged me and accused us of checking out late. Carla told me we were 8 hours past check out time even though we still had another 4 hours until then. We ended up leaving earlier than planned because we really did not want to stay and deal with her any longer. Other than the host we believed the apartment was a great choice as it was stunning and in a great location.
31424811,426286535,2019-03-20,118844116,Kevin,Great place. I would advise bringing a sleeping mask because there are a ton of windows and the curtains don’t block out any light. Location is so good.
6628792,80135226,2016-06-16,39055505,Michelle,"Wonderful hosts! Room was clean and nice. Felt instantly home. 
Marina and Yuri were very friendly but also respects privacy.  "
10682351,83492588,2016-07-03,1421234,Margo,Ben's apartment was well located clean and had basic amenities. The Internet was good. The air conditioner was a floor unit that cooled the kitchen and living area well and the bedroom poorly though there was a ceiling fan.  The flat was furnished with ikea everything and low cost appliances. The closet doors and oven drawer fought to stay on track. There was nowhere to unpack a suitcase. Overall it was a relatively comfortable quiet spot with a unique view but it was certainly an investment property and not a home.

The flat itself is well equipped...very good tea and also has butter jam etc so you can easily settle in....the house is a bit old and has some old fixtures but in general the flat is well equipped...and best of all is the bed!  Slept very soundly here.  Also a separate entrance to the flat itself.  The host is also very friendly and nice.

29826632,354934495,2018-12-02,56351954,Sara,We really enjoyed the space. We are locals that needed a night away and we didn’t want to trek downtown or stay in someone’s rental house. This place was unique had character was super clean and so comfortable! Such a wonderful surprise in South Etobicoke. Can’t wait for another excuse to need to stay again!
18159793,183575295,2017-08-17,47007849,Alberto,"Geoffrey è veramente un ragazzo adorabile gentile e disponibile. Ci ha chiamato un taxi stampato la prenotazione e al momento della nostra partenza durante la notte si è assicurato che l'avessimo preso. Anche i suoi suggerimenti in materia di posti da visitare e locali sono stati molto utili e perfetti.
L'appartamento è perfetto in tutti i sensi: pulitissimo curato nei dettagli e arredato con gusto e amore. Anche la camera dove ci ha ospitati è deliziosa. Idem per il bagno.
Semmai dovessimo tornare a Toronto andremo sicuramente da lui.

39951308,561458011,2019-11-09,204232548,Acacia,This place is very nice!! Thanks for having me!!!!
31038635,570498684,2019-11-29,285522520,Andrew,The place was great to stay at exactly as it was described.  Amazing location to most things in the Toronto area.
2450170,16976906,2014-08-05,6548036,Laura,Great clean place and great location. There's a subway station right across from the apartment building tons of restaurant and food places around the corner and only a 5-10 minutes walk from Eaton Centre. The place itself is not too big but it's clean and fits 4 people perfectly. We had everything that we needed.
1101055,527846156,2019-09-11,251625311,Malika,This apartment is a 1 bedroom that's been converted into a 2 bedroom with a makeshift wall which provides less privacy than the photos suggest.
24157569,448700039,2019-05-05,259414040,Noel,Lovely and QUIET. If you just want a nice place to sleep come here.
27131740,527326622,2019-09-10,41292162,Davis,Check in was super easy Kayleigh came down to the lobby to meet me. It is a locked apartment building so you cannot enter through the main doors without a key. The room is nice and simple just the bed and some drawers. There are no windows to the room just an air vent which was fine for me. It was difficult to wake up in the morning with all the darkness but no big deal. Location was perfect! You could see the harbour form the balcony and just a 5 min walk down to the harbour itself. Everything is super walkable (max 20 minutes depending where you’re going) otherwise it’s a reasonable ride share away. didn’t use public transport much but walked passed the station often. Also super close to the CN tower and Rogers. Shared a bathroom with Kayleigh never had any issues with timing. The building is secure and has a market and coffee just down the stairs. Everything opens with the key card except the front door. Would recommend!
30059928,360435385,2018-12-20,61616092,Peng,Warmhandsomecareful owner.I will live here next time in Toronto! Thanks a lot!

30759905,413531278,2019-02-17,83802704,Tamanna,An incredibly clean comfortable and convenient place to stay! Shayan and Mehran were quick to respond to any questions we had too. Perfect accommodation and hosts.
16437307,318189011,2018-09-03,22191733,Maddy,"The apartment itself is beautifully decorated clean organized and equipped with everything you need to make your own food and clean your clothes. The host made sure we knew how to get in where to park and what to do when you checkout. 

Downtown is a cheap Uber ride away. There are a bunch of public bikes around the area which you can rent ( we biked to Chinatown). 

 The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because we didn't expect it to be in a building that was a pretty run down.  When we told Uber drivers where we were staying each one asked us why we decided to stay there and to be careful. I haven't had reactions like this from Uber drivers in general and not more than one saying the same thing. So that was a little concerning.  

As long as you know the building is pretty run down and make sure to keep your eyes open when you go in and out of the building you will not be disappointed. The apartment has everything you need the host very nice and responds quickly."

21097412,534502380,2019-09-22,103004611,Tammy,Judy and Tony's house is modern and clean. It is laid out really well for a large family or group and has four bathrooms all with showers! Tony was there to welcome us and show us around. He took care of any concerns and requests we had. The house was easy to get to but be prepared for Toronto traffic give yourself lots of time to travel! We struggled a little with the water pressure not sure if that can be addressed and the kitchen has only the bare necessities for cooking and dinner place settings. Other than that it was a wonderful home to stay in. I would recommend it to anyone.
34660080,454555027,2019-05-18,38981779,Thuy,Very pleased with my short stay here! I was attending an event at the Coca-Cola Coliseum and was pleased to find out it’s within a 15mins walk!

The staff behind SimplyComfort are quick to response to texts as well which was very appreciated.

We walked all the way to the lake while exploring the city and never felt unsafe or far from attractions.

1382277,95894463,2016-08-21,31609941,Melissa,"This loft was just as amazing as everyone says. It has amazing decor and is in a wonderful location. Cristina was so nice as well. When she came by to get the key and we told her we had gotten in too late the night before to see the roof she insisted that we still go check it out even though we were supposed to be checking out. 
She also have us great suggestions as to what to do in the area and made sure we knew we could keep our car in visitor parking all day after checking out to save money. 
I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone! "

27800382,556803462,2019-10-30,225856334,Yulanda,Overall nice place to stay  it is centrally located in the Entertainment District.  We stayed a week and could walk wherever we needed to go.  The listing doesn’t show this but the unit is on ground level with access from the street the door was tricky and we actually had some issues with the door that I think are resolved now.
8195595,58209944,2016-01-01,51370004,Nikolaos,This apartment is located in an amazing spot so close to everything and this makes it a great location if you are sightseeing. The room was as described and the lovely complimentary toiletries drinks and snacks were amazing. There was a slight smell and a few small flies in the house but completely deal able considering the price.
16195283,247209069,2018-03-27,57141195,Lyndsey,A lovely modern apartment in a great location.  I dont think there is anywhere else you’d get such a spectacular view of the CN Tower. Great communication from our hosts making check in / out a breeze. Would highly recommend.
10453200,166418079,2017-07-03,99808463,Brenna,This is a great place in a wonderful location. We love exploring new places in Toronto. This place is walking distance to many cute little pub/restaurants. It is easy to navigate transit to the downtown locations etc. The hosts go out of their way to make things comfortable; providing toiletries etc. We were provided with a key code to use for entry which made check in and check out easy. Wifi was available upon entry and they even had a couple of bottles of water in the fridge. We would be happy to stay here again! 
17775203,236516218,2018-02-19,26916402,Waleed,Very spacious clean space. Shawn was an excellent host and responded instantly.
20693466,350127797,2018-11-18,124896109,Melissa,I stayed at Khoa's lovely home for two days when I spent the weekend in Toronto after a work trip. Noodles and Husker are adorable and super friendly. Location room amenities are all excellent - pictures don't do the place justice. Khoa was incredibly hospitable; gave me plentiful food suggestions showed me how to use the front lock even looked up the whereabouts of the Santa Claus so I can avoid traffic on my way to the train station. Thanks Khoa!

20902086,243900055,2018-03-17,41962175,YeEun,The location was nice and the place was clean. Almost as expected but the host knew that there were 6 of us coming going to be using 3 beds but there were only two bed duvets. Also there were only four sets of cutleries. I wish there were shampoos that could have been used for both genders. They only provided shampoo for men with strong scent.
24748547,431291050,2019-03-31,2618407,Sonal,The space was bright and clean and the beds were very comfortable! Jay let us drop off bags before check in which was very helpful.  It would have been helpful to have more information in the check in guide (it was mainly local recommendations) such as how the heating works for the unit and expectations for checkout. The space was chilly when we arrived and I texted to ask how to access the heat but didn't receive a reply back. Other than that the space was lovely!
13583920,90736324,2016-08-02,81318789,Thomas,La maison de notre hôte est facilement localiser dans la ville de Toronto. Le stationnement était grandement disponible (avec le permis de la ville).  L'accueil de nos hôtes est un exemple de gentillesse et de disponibilité à toutes nos questions. La chambre est confortable et le déjeuner délicieux. La cour arrière est charmante. Les restaurants que nous avons découverts dans le quartier sont  de bonnes qualités. Le transport en commun très accécible depuis la maison de Fraser et Pam.
14694749,244390088,2018-03-18,12618992,Orah,My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and I cannot think of one negative thing to say. Amanda and Jason were always contacting us to make sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. As frequent Toronto goers we didn’t need many suggestions but we did still utilize the list of all their day trips and recommendations. The space is beautiful and has a separate entrance. We didn’t actually even meet Amanda or Jason because we had our own separate entrance and just never happened to cross paths. Price is very affordable and this place is an amazing value for what it costs and the location. Highly recommend!

Maja was very helpful leading up to our arrival and we were both extremely pleased with the accommodation. The pictures don't do it justice!

I have already recommended the room to friends and family and will not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you! "

I would probably contact her again in the future.  Thank you Kat and to your assistant...

3684349,102332215,2016-09-17,331327,Brad,Easy check in via an app with excellent communication from Pedram.   The location is outstanding especially for blue jays games and walkable access to the best of Toronto.   The condo was clean comfortable and quiet.  Good size for my wife baby and myself but would be tight quarters for 4 adults.  Great neighbourhood with groceries coffee shop and restaurants within a block and no concerns walking around at night.  Solid amenities in the building with a pool and gym.   I would definitely stay here again in the future.  
24558138,289590631,2018-07-12,151103517,Thorolf,"Bei unserer aller ersten Airbnb-Erfahrung hatten wir eine gute Zeit in der Souterrain-Wohnung von Nina und Sadaf.
Vorabkommunikation und Check-in Prozess liefen dank der umfangreichen Unterlagen und Informationen reibungslos. U-Bahn Station sowie eine sehr große Anzahl verschiedener Restaurants befindet sich in Fußnähe.
Die Wohnung befindet sich in einer schönen und ruhigen Wohnstraße mit kleineren Häusern. Um die nächste Straßenecke pulsiert das Leben. Von den etlichen Bauprojekten an der Hauptstraße ging kein Lärm aus den wir in der Wohnung wahrnehmen könnten.
Auf Nachfragen während des Aufenthalts würde sehr schnell reagiert.
Zu meinem Hinweis dass das Bett hart ist erklärten Nina und Sadaf dass eine neue Matratze bereits bestellt sei."
22705913,367298330,2019-01-04,3674423,Kendra,Katie and Philippe’s place is super stylish and spacious. The location is unbeatable and we walked or took a <15 min bus or streetcar to anywhere we needed to go. The bed was very comfortable! We especially appreciated Katie and Philippe’s quick communication and flexibility in letting us store our luggage until we headed out of the city. Overall a great stay and would definitely return again. Quick tip — this wasn’t an issue for us but if you’re sensitive to sound or seeking a quiet space it’s helpful to note that sound carries a bit from the upstairs apartment!

14405520,217276493,2017-12-08,160665592,Moe,Lily is a good host and the place is close to Downtown Toronto and Chinatown also. I would like to recommend this place but if I do this will keep the rooms occupied and by this no space will be available for me when I am being in Toronto. Thanks Lily.
34829275,545574768,2019-10-12,223224029,Alireza,"Walter was kind enough to let us drop our bags in a couple of hours earlier and that was very much appreciated. We have privacy and our own separate entrance which was great

However the place is a basement and even walking upstairs makes a ton of noise. As the host lives upstairs this was a problem. On one occasion my girlfriend was woken up by the upstairs tv noise at 8 am.  The WIFI was unreliable and slow. We could not load videos (netflix) reliably. The bathroom sink fridge and microwave were dirty on check in as well. There was also a lot of bugs in the backyard (our entrance) making the walk inside unpleasant."
6763562,45264353,2015-09-01,23759711,Dale,We had a very nice experience at Daniel's place in Toronto. It's a great location adjacent to Chinatown the Kensington Market the University of Toronto main campus and several other interesting west Toronto neighborhoods. Of course there is easy access to the extensive Toronto public transportation system that will take you pretty much anywhere in the city. The apartment itself is quite nice: comfortable spacious clean and everything is in working order. And Daniel is extremely friendly welcoming and helpful. Overall it was a very nice airbnb experience.
16193976,198824524,2017-09-30,63271154,Michael,Jerry and Nat's place was very beautiful modern and clean. Not to mention that the location is perfectly placed in the heart of downtown. Would recommend it to anyone! 5/5!

13922450,153585490,2017-05-21,110595881,Brandon,Our stay in Toronto was simply fantastic thanks to Gwen and Tam. The loft exceeded my expectations and provided everything my girlfriend and I needed while there. Gwen was very responsive and quickly answered any questions we had. The loft's details and decor are more stylish than the pictures can do justice; you can tell that care went into creating this space. I had nothing but pleasure during my trip and cannot wait to return to Toronto.

28991832,362490217,2018-12-26,77110960,Jacob,"Stylish flat in a modern building with very responsive friendly hosts. The flat was a nice size very clean and well furnished.

Jessica checked in throughout our stay to see how things were going which was very nice.

She and her associate Glen really went the extra mile when my mum misplaced a mug I've had throughout moves to 3 different countries. They found it and remembered that I was in town for another few days. Glen was going to be nearby where I was staying with a friend and met me to return it.

The only substantive issue was the sofa bed which is actually a futon and was hard as a board.

I would definitely recommend this place for someone needing one bed."
13951772,236553882,2018-02-19,103866612,Cody,Don was a great host and we really enjoyed our stay in Toronto. The apartment was spacious and a short walk away from everything you need. I would stay here again without hesitation!

Thank you again Karen and Michael for the warm hospitality.

Key pickup was really easy and her apartment was elegant and clean and located quite centrally (we walked everywhere and it's very close to the metro and some good restaurants). The wonderful view of the CN tower is exactly as it appears in the pictures!
15698833,324055335,2018-09-16,4160997,Adam,We weren't there for long but it was a decent location and the unit was charming and well-appointed.  We struggled with a lack of parking and A/C but we didn't chat with Jason or do our homework on either ahead of our arrival.  We'll stay here again!
4848038,180209182,2017-08-09,39977175,Cheryle,A perfect home away from home.  Spotlessly clean.  Quiet and super comfortable.  Steps from the Danforth and all its shops restaurants and pubs.  2 minute walk to the subway and 20 minutes to Union Station.
22111948,482478337,2019-07-06,139523811,Michael,Sarah was very accommodating and the space was clean. It was perfect for 3 people. I would recommend this space.
19357728,199654170,2017-10-02,122734566,Bo,The location of this unit is AMAZING. It is literally one/two blocks away from both Union Station the CN tower and the lake. View from this 51st floor unit is simply just incredible both day and night views of the lake CN tower and looking west towards the horizon. As for the suite itself super modern clean everything a person needs for modern day living is included not to mention watching Netflix in 4K. The host is also super friendly and attentive. I will most definitely book Jake's place again next time I'm in town. Other Airbnb hosts can definitely learn a thing or two from him!

She greeted me showed me around  suggested cool things to do and was an overall awesome girl.  She's happy to socialize or give you space. This was my first time using the site and I couldn't have found a better place to stay. I would recommend this space to anybody visiting Toronto!

17323608,163111929,2017-06-23,75323786,Julia,Sam's place has a great location we were a few minutes walk from Roger's centre the CN tower and Ripley's aquarium.  Also the view of the CN tower is wonderful both at day and night.  There was a couple of nice restaurants nearby and a wonderful grocery store right around the corner.  We never got to meet Sam but he was quick to answer messages and allowed us to check in a bit earlier for which we were very grateful.  We really enjoyed our time there!! Thank you very much Sam!!

Abnb 를 처음으로 이용했어요.
예약하는 방법도 낯설고 숙소는 문제없는 곳일지 걱정이 많았어요.
Evan이 제공해준 숙소 사진과 숙소 시설에 대한 내용은 모두 일치했습니다.
서브웨이가 가깝고 다운타운과 가까워서
제가 갈려고 하였던 모든 곳으로 쉽게 갈 수
있었어요.
비싼 토론토 물가를 생각하면 여기 숙소의

Thank you!"
666670,7247428,2013-09-13,7838803,Michael,I stayed in the Super Studio and the place was as advertised--clean comfortable convenient. There were a couple of items missing but once alerted Nick rectified on the double. The basement apartment can be affected by upstairs noise--but be friendly and people will generally try harder to be quiet. Throughout my experience with Nick he was very quick to communicate and provide advice or a solution. I'd definitely recommend Nick's rentals. 
1754254,357213580,2018-12-09,88402964,Praveen,"It was a fantastic 2 weeks of stay @Greg's place:

1. The check-in was seamless and keyless. Really liked the idea of moving around without the hassle of not carrying the keys. Greg was kind to accommodate me an hour earlier than the scheduled check-in time.
2. The room was bright & spacious with 6 pillows a really warm blanket table lamps and a room heater. There was motion detected lighting on the stairs which I liked it.
3. The bathrooms were sparkling clean with shampoos soaps and towels all inclusive.
4. The kitchen was nice and cute. lot of cutleries salt & sugar adequate space in the refrigerator to store food and microwave to heat them. 
5. The location was great less than a minute to Dufferin Loop easy access to `TTC Gardiner highway Kings Street W and the downtown. 
6. Greg was very hospitable very polite and accommodative and prompt in responding to any queries. Keep up the good job.

In all I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant stay in Toronto.

The place is quite convenience to get into Toronto downtown. What's more Stanley's cooking skill is terrific you must try his awesome breakfast and dinner.
If I would go to Toronto again there is no doubt that I would stay at Stanley's apartment again."

4922566,30850122,2015-04-27,31623813,Matilda,Staying at Elaine & Greg's house was my first airbnb experience and I loved it! Their house is in a great location is beautiful clean and comfortable and within walking distance to downtown. Elaine was so welcoming writing all of her guests a little welcome sign for their room and making me cups of tea when I came in the door after a long day of exploring the city. It made my visit to Toronto really enjoyable. I would have liked to stay longer and will definitely look Elaine & Greg up next time I am in Toronto! Thank-you both :)

22244390,318843899,2018-09-04,54486553,Austin,This place made for a very comfortable 5-night home for our group. Perfectly livable space with comfy beds a great couch solid kitchen. Very spacious and clean. The back patio is lovely - we wish we used it more. The inconveniences were minor: dishwasher was broken pretty noticeable dog smell. Location felt plenty safe but isn't central to any immediate excitement. You'll have to uber/bus/etc. most places. Overall great stay - would book again.

38324047,569110764,2019-11-25,115792534,Bettina,The room was great for a short stay. Check-in and check-out were extremely easy. The space was also super clean.  There were also amenities provided such as a soap towels and a hair dryer which was great. The bed was comfortable and firm which is my personal preference. If you are a light sleeper though I would recommend bringing earplugs - my friend and I stayed for 3 nights and each time we could hear people in the other room singing and video chatting.

15302170,470908062,2019-06-16,41785210,Kylin,This place is large and clean. It’s even pretty large for four of us to stay. Arian was friendly and tried his best to satisfy our needs during our stay. The location of this place is pretty accurate as described - 8 mins walk to St George station. Since the room was in an old building it was a bit noisy when other guests were around the room. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place.

(inside Longo's)  Kitchen is nicely equipped much better than most places I've stayed in on airbnb lots of pots pans plates etc.  Lots of clean linens provided washer and dryer in unit for longer stays.  Research parking if you need it I payed $45 for 24 hours in the buildings underground garage there may be cheaper options but less convenient.  All in all a great place to stay and I'm sure I will be back!

5783911,475061332,2019-06-23,23529647,Emily,We stayed at Nick and Nena’s for our wedding weekend along with our wedding party renting the whole house. The space worked perfectly for our needs and they allowed us to store our bags early as they cleaned from the previous guests which was a big bonus. They responded quickly to questions and it was helpful to find a grocery store within walking distance and bus stop just across the street. We would definitely stay there again with a bigger group.

202636,41065670,2015-08-04,17381388,Melanie,"Amita and Richard were awesome! There were 4 of us staying at the house and it was very comfortable. Upon arrival a bottle of wine was given to us as well as some beer! The hosts accommodated us with extra space to use due to the inconvenience of their main fridge being broken during our stay -- the basement fridge was sufficient for a week's worth of food for 4 people.

Every time we needed help or had any questions Richard was very quick to reply. I never met Amita but Richard was very friendly and welcoming. Most of us were not locals so the residential parking was a bit confusing and got us tickets the first few times (even with the permit). If anything ask the neighbours 'cuz they're really friendly too!

Thank you Amita and Richard your home made our trip amazing."

The location is excellent.  It is close to the subway station supermarket shops restaurants and the University of Toronto.  From the balcony one can look over Bloor street which is full of restaurants."

15360785,220945612,2017-12-24,124739184,Christine,Lovely place in a great location in Toronto. The space was clean and cozy. Jerry & Natalie were great with communicating and accommodating my family. We had a blast. Thanks again!

5431514,150334494,2017-05-07,122943465,Nitesh,Tammy is good and quick to communicate with and always available to assist you. Had a nice stay only drawback was it's an extremely quiet neighbourhood and I wasn't aware it was a basement apartment. Recommended for couples who want their own space and time. 
23146890,287764728,2018-07-08,94823590,Anne,I had a very nice stay at their house in North York. It's placed in a quite clean neighborhood and everyone was super welcoming. The shared bathroom is perfect since you can lock it from both entrances. They've got an awesome water dispenser for ice cold water as well - perfect for the summer. Thanks for everything. Cheers Anne
29820703,420396787,2019-03-06,62684023,Derek,After a slight hiccup in the beginning due to msicommunication between host and cleaner I had a great stay. Host was very quick in responding to messages which was greatly appreciated. I reccomend this place and would stay again.
8740736,97767668,2016-08-28,53585419,Jana Sophia,I enjoyed the time at Leslie's home very much sadly I was there for just  one night. But I hope I can return as soon as possible to meet Leslie again and live in her lovely comfortable house for a little longer.

1544959,287694023,2018-07-08,132218214,Sandra,Irene is very caring host who has a friendly clean and comfortable home that is very conveniently located close to Don Mills subway and Fairview Mall. She is always ready to help and make her guests’ stay as comfortable as possible. Highly recommended! All five stars!
4310793,25967585,2015-01-31,25329788,Lillian,"I had a fantastic stay here! Tam is a very relaxed friendly and helpful host. He is extremely hospitable and was always asking if he could help with anything or provide a meal. I really appreciated his brief tour of the condo upon arrival and orientation to transport/restaurants nearby. 
The condo is very clean and comfortable and is located in a very accessible place. I would stay here again and would recommend this place to my friends visiting Toronto in the future!"
5562649,435124250,2019-04-09,6949798,Elise,KJ's flat is in an ideal location near downtown Toronto. I was traveling for a conference and loved the convenience of being able to walk to the Toronto Convention Center.
20590976,318511566,2018-09-03,22043064,Vaibhav,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
23288133,260976596,2018-05-05,117576416,Cheryl,"Julia’s place is a basement suite reasonably appointed in a quiet family area. However a walk of no more than 15 minutes will get you to the subway & the bustling cafe shopping precinct. There is also a bus stop directly outside the house for those who don’t care to walk.  
Just be aware that the low ceiling height may not suit some people."
13716594,235705857,2018-02-17,37167754,Mia,This space is perfect for a little getaway! Exactly as shown in the photos. The space is clean colourful and very pleasing to the eye. One heads up though: if you plan to use the pull out bed they do not provide sleeping pillows or blankets so definitely come prepared with those. The place can also become a tad loud with partygoers on the weekend due to the thin doors so if you are looking for a quiet stay weekend trips here probably won’t be the best for you (I can’t speak for weekdays). All in all my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed this place it was very comfortable and homey for our short trip.
21325388,429316942,2019-03-27,20286921,James,Great location and amazing view
37216696,531439473,2019-09-17,244232557,Ilias,"It was a great experience staying at Flyura’s place. The location is amazing right next to the Union station. One free parking spot was an awesome deal.
The condo was very clean modern and had everything you need to make your stay comfortable."

36390763,554488450,2019-10-26,224418352,Mohanad,Beautiful place to stay. Very clean. Very nice area. Parking can be a pain as you cant really park on premise but lots of parking places walking minutes from the property. Overall great place!

The condo is beautiful and the perfect size for 4 people. It was beautifully decorated. The view was amazing! I will definitely consider staying here again.
13298933,508347737,2019-08-12,269356107,Justin,If you are planning a trip to Toronto Andrew’s place is perfect! Everything was clean and quite stylish. The location was also perfect as it only a short walk away from Downtown Toronto and other Toronto must sees (like Graffiti Alley and much more).
34316506,484329930,2019-07-08,21298969,Julia,David is an outstanding host! We found the room clean and cozy  exactly what we were looking for. The room is fairly small but has everything you need even beverages and treats best valued place I’ve ever stayed in! Communication with David was easy. He’s very responsive and accommodating offered tips to get around and even spared us their parking spot for the night. I’d stay at David’s home again and would recommend to anyone A+!
22615092,301065065,2018-08-03,154424649,Haider,The place was clean had a great location and view was amazing. Also the hosts were very friendly and quick to respond.
36243257,561532660,2019-11-09,13417655,Cari,Murray and Harry’s place is well located with a great view. The master bed is so comfortable!  The grocery store attached to the building is very convenient. We would recommend this place to others and will hopefully stay again ourselves.

7093099,44385535,2015-08-25,41769518,Jeanne,"Our travel plans had to be adjusted but the hosts were gracious and flexible providing spacious and secure accommodations.  Breakfast each morning was delicious and respectful of allergies and dietary preferences.  The home was comfortable with plenty of spaces for relaxing including an outdoor yard/deck.  The quiet neighborhood provided an opportunity for a nice long leisurely walk and the location is easy driving to nearby parks and beaches tea/coffee shops & restaurants as well. (free parking in their driveway was a bonus as many of the listed airBnB's don't offer parking!)

The hosts were welcoming and enjoyed joining us for morning breakfast but were OK with giving us space to eat alone if we preferred.  The only real ""negatives"" were not having wifi the distance to downtown Toronto and the reality that it is an older well lived-in home not a modern 4 star hotel.  But frankly for the price the experience met our needs and gave us an opportunity to make new friends - something you don't usually get at a hotel!  As far as the distance to downtown we were able to park at a subway station near their home and get an inexpensive day-pass for subway trains streetcars and buses and explore without the need for parking fees."
7610557,431092208,2019-03-31,78495818,Richard,We enjoyed staying at Christopher's place.  Loved the decor  cleanliness the convenient location and all the amenities.

11648181,291209403,2018-07-15,3266561,Ingrid,I have stayed at many AirBnbs over the years and this one was by far my favorite!  It felt like a perfect version of home with small touches (yoga mat! AppleTV!) that made the place very comfortable.  The beautiful balcony above the street (8th fl) was a lovely place for morning yoga or coffee.  The kitchen was well appointed.  Olya left a binder full of local recommendations that I enjoyed (don't miss the sushi at the dry cleaners--sounds odd but trust me!)  I would stay here again and again.

29483375,507562100,2019-08-11,16297895,Tushar,Exactly as described. Location is the key - everything is close by and it's very safe. Minor glitches during check-in that were rectified smoothly. Kitchen was well stocked. Bathroom was stocked though it requires some deep cleaning - air freshener wouldn't be a bad idea. Check out was breeze

Everything you need is provided and Navid was great at giving recommendations or accommodations when needed. He was very friendly kind and professional. Regardless of my many many questions Navid was patient and understanding every time giving me a straightforward answer. 

As a first-time Airbnb experience my partner and I could not have asked for a better experience. We both highly recommend Navid as a host and look forward to staying with him again in the future."
18648081,352631070,2018-11-25,223356868,Nancy,Excellent location. Well provided re things like towels  soap linens etc. Do bring wine glasses and a corkscrew however if you like wine. Loads of martini glasses though if that’s your preference. Enjoyed our stay.

Das Zimmer ist liebevoll und praktisch eingerichtet. Es fehlte uns an nichts. Chris stand zudem jederzeit für Fragen und gute Tipps zur Verfügung. Die Umgebung ist sehr charmant mit vielen kleinen Restaurants und Shops. Die Straßenbahn in die Innenstadt fährt fast vor der Haustüre. Sehr zu empfehlen!
13182530,354892083,2018-12-02,156512706,Jeffrey,just keep away from the shorter lady with the glasses on the profile pic. she is completely unfit to run the business. she can ruin your day in a split of a second. no manners rude disrespectful and doesn’t know how to talk to people. i mean what is the whole point to come to a spotlessly clean house with everything well arranged if the host is going to spit poison in the form of words and disrespect u? and i honestly hope she reaches out to apologize and tell me it was something wrong about her and that’s why she went ballistic on me for no reason whatsoever
10156168,179488875,2017-08-07,136555879,Glenn,Great location for access to transportation and a wide selection of nearby restaurants.  Spectacular views!

33136454,431658546,2019-04-01,20951617,Katarina,"Although a short trip I must say a very sweet one at that. I greeted Ariana the host at the door for check-in at 3 PM and she gave me a mini tour around the house and showed me to the amenities provided during my stay.  

The house was beautifully furnished and not to mention bright and cozy.  She then showed me to the room and I immediately felt at home. The place was clean spacious and I truly appreciated the little but also significant touches that she added such as the cup + jug of water ensemble and a neighbourhood guide for the best eats in the city along with activities to do.

The whole process went smooth sailing with no hiccups along the way and that's what I always look for and appreciate at the end of it all. It just made my stay that much more peaceful and relaxing.

I would definitely stay here again and possibly book the blue room next time!"

Although the room I was in had no windows this was not an issue as the room was very spacious.   At this air b n b there is a separate entrance to the place which is nice for those who may not feel comfortable walking through someone else’s living space. Bathroom is shared but I did not have to wait to use it and it was very clean.

21218647,452197896,2019-05-12,70862859,Lisa,Shy is a good host.  The apt is very smaller than it appears in the photos. There are three sets of steep steps to be aware of. Cleanliness could have been improved but the location was great.
959676,8247077,2013-10-21,9506386,Christina,Michael was the most amazing host on airbnb! His apartment was so lovely and beautiful. His artwork was eclectic and absolutely stunning. He was so well prepared and has everything available for you from aux cables to toiletries to candles and lighters. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay and want to go back so many more times. It was the perfect weekend getaway for us and Michael's apartment made it memorable. He was very easy to communicate with and extremely accommodating. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone and everyone to stay here it is truly AMAZING!!!!

6388015,263647021,2018-05-12,37430015,Aurélie,Kelly's place was great and perfectly matched the pictures. One thing is missing in the description though: Kelly's ability to make you feel at home even for a short stay her kindness and the way she makes everything so you can take the best from your trip. Definitely a place to stay reminds the traveller of the original purpose of AirBnB which wasn't only to find a place to sleep but also a way to connect people all around the world.
24711858,311090294,2018-08-20,192979944,Clotilde,"Very well located modern and very clean accommodation.
Stéphanie is very responsive. 
The sound insulation between the rooms is very poor. You can hear all the noise from the other rooms and the common areas. "
21950169,514072954,2019-08-20,132121715,Terry,A fine place to stay!  Even the 3 apartments and shared kitchen and bathroom facilities worked out fine!  Parking was a bonus!   Pristine!

13781103,97234336,2016-08-26,89125020,Beatriz,Paul was expecting us even though we were 1 1/2 hr. late and our communication was choppy from our part. He had everything ready and quickly showed us the place and the amenities. In addition to the accommodations he also had snacks ready extra toiletries and even gave us coins to do laundry in the facilities! We appreciated his graciousness and thoughtfulness. We were able to relax do laundry watch TV have a hot drink take a shower as if we were home. Our little dog was with us and he felt right at home there also. It was our first Airbnb experience and it was definitely a great one! Thank you Paul for being such a great host!
20826348,303094306,2018-08-06,83612650,Daniella,"Great host with a lovely family. Enjoyed having conversations with her. Loved the simple touches like the sweet basket and tassimo. 
Very clean apartment. Highly recommend "
25517185,330363159,2018-09-30,53229238,Bohdan,Self check in process was a breeze easy parking and fantastic location.  The space though a bit small (really tall people might have an issue) was clean and well laid out.  We had a great time and would definitely stay there again next time we're in Toronto!
33964988,573957264,2019-12-07,52603287,Andrea,Great place for a solo traveler or couple. It’s a tiny yet cozy space to stay for a good price and in a great location only 10 minutes away from the subway and 1 block away from a cool coffee shop and a bus stop. Josh was very responsive and made sure we were comfortable at all times.
34361764,563316837,2019-11-12,95438810,Daryl,The location of this place is amazing !  We were here for a concert at the scotia bank centre. It is literally a 5 minute walk.   And the room was perfect.  Great view of the city CN Tower right there really nice.
33579866,435479248,2019-04-10,194567784,Jay-D,Stay here over anywhere else. Wicked location.
29106392,463041629,2019-06-02,766063,Cliff,"What a value!  It's quite swanky for the price.  The layout and furnishing and amenities are THE BEST.  Amir was friendly and helpful.  Assured he would respond right away if needed.
He wasn't needed because the place is so thought out.   
Great light spanking new building  convenient location to where I was working (Harbor Front Westin)  I would stay there many times.  It feels like a home away from home."
18795361,479120203,2019-06-30,3949515,Hyungu,Wonderful place and location! Lukas was extremely accomodating and quick with communication! I would definitely stay here again!
21641935,216320875,2017-12-03,47845802,Nishanth,Adrian's place is perfect! Lots of space and super close to the transit. Walking distance from most of the Toronto excitement and entertainment.
20862227,289537177,2018-07-12,200607924,Rania,The apartment was very clean and stylish. The location was perfect for us as it was within close proximity to most major attractions. The host Danial was extremely helpful answering all our questions quickly and efficiently. The neighborhood is very lively but still quite enough for families. I would definitely recommend using the apartment when visiting Toronto.
13475435,162609236,2017-06-21,91611543,Vinay,I really enjoyed my stay. The place was immaculately clean and everything was as described. Aaron was prompt in his communication and there were no problems at all. It's a residential area but there are plenty of bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood. However if you're looking for an active party scene then this isn't the right place. The downtown core is a bit of a walk so be prepared to exercise those legs or Uber it down. I enjoyed the walks and seeing a part of the city I otherwise would have missed. 
21190559,520491602,2019-08-30,33335084,Stella,This place is amazing! Joseph made himself available for whenever you needed him but everything was so well organized that bothering him was so unnecessary! Great location. Amazingly clean and beautiful. Just 5 minutes walk to everything! One of the best Airbnb homes ever! Thank you Joseph ❤️
4086038,92400607,2016-08-08,12698556,Lisa,"Super central and convenient location right next to Eaton Centre in the heart of downtown! Great quality bed everything clean and tidy and comfortable. Charise was super helpful and friendly and the place really felt like home for a few days.
The Stages cafe downstairs has a nice breakfast selection including oatmeal cereals yogurts delicious omelettes etc."

6453260,327152415,2018-09-23,203027548,Maryam,My parents had a great stay in Milad's place. The location of the place is very good. It is close to many shops and restaurants. Metro station is close which is very convenient.
14774496,192061173,2017-09-09,111636588,Trudie,Not as clean or as perfect as it looks in the pictures. The location is wonderful.
21677102,216367517,2017-12-03,22051237,Tina,The location was very convenient the unit was clean and the concierge was friendly. The parking spot included was an added bonus. Miles & Paul were great with communication.
17142155,154918425,2017-05-26,130488766,Chenxuan,Super convenient location with restaurant grocery store shopping close to down but in a quieter area. 5 start plus comfortable house good for CBD group- Super clean) Fully facilitated with anything you will possibly need from a home. Much more comfortable than 5 star plus hotel. Host are efficient and friendly. Wether you want to stay on to spend a cozy day or go out hanging out with friends this house is perfect for you. The experience is much more worthy than the price paid. Highly recommended!!!!!!
18406000,433440955,2019-04-06,117657200,Jennifer,Jolene’s place was exactly like the photos!  The space was very comfortable and stylish. It was a great place to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. The parking is a huge plus and the gym/pool are awesome as well. Would definitely stay again!
16569573,159772058,2017-06-11,54270473,Becky,It was a beautifully decorated apartment. A bit smaller than we expected for a 3 person family but worked just perfectly for us in the end. Ben was easy to communicate with and super helpful when we were having problems getting in at first! 
15112971,358208175,2018-12-13,189815956,Sarah,Great place for a couple to stay. Although they say you may here a baby or a dog you could barely hear anything in the basement. Even being close to a Main Street it was still very quiet. Parking is definitely use at your own risk. Nintendo 64 was awesome to play with in our down time. Location is very close to the Christmas Market which was our purpose of stay.
18998606,198475095,2017-09-29,147291525,Luigi,Excellent stay highly recommend!
19071821,216364544,2017-12-03,11160206,Sho,Location was great and the room had all the basics needed for a base location to either explore the city as a tourist or settle in a new resident. Very clean and tidy place bathroom was great as well. Very reasonable pricing for the area too! Caesar was also very helpful host and was there whenever needed.  Stayed for 10days was just what I needed!
2455129,58154073,2016-01-01,46656603,Grace,Can't beat the location lovely view out the window looking out onto the lake with Yonge-Dundas square a 20 minute walk away or a subway station 5 mins away. Apartment was clean and tidy and Katy had left lots of helpful leaflets and maps for us. The apartment building itself is extremely safe and is a very nice block! Thanks Katy!
28301823,541620315,2019-10-05,294758280,Gail,My sister daughter and myself stayed at Ashley's for 2 and a half days and we couldnt have been more pleased. All major attractions are within walking distance and other hotspots within a short taxi drive. We were central to everything our trip was planned for. Her condo was perfect for our stay and she was always quick to respond to any questions we had.  She is pleasant and had some great suggestions not on our itinerary. Check in and check out was super easy. I highly recommend and would definitely stay again if I return to Toronto! 5 stars!
15115175,127209219,2017-01-16,69252060,Karla,Great host! It was very clean organized and most importantly cozy. The local area was great it was walking distance from subway or taxi. Definitely would recommend it 
6226722,182876038,2017-08-15,96864445,Gregory,Naomi was responsive attentive friendly and helpful in any way we could have asked. Her apartment was super cozy and the rooftop way better than we expected. All in all we really felt at home and loved having this home to return to each day.
18009897,144839447,2017-04-16,104832200,Yasmien,Very accurate to the pics and description and perfect location 
26878175,491765205,2019-07-20,2058933,Katherine,Kris’ place was perfectly located for a first time visitor to Toronto and for a business traveler. During the hot summer the ac worked perfectly and having in unit laundry was very convenient. All the best of a modern hotel with the added bonus of a kitchen and laundry! Bonus points for a high quality hair dryer and multiple fluffy pillows :)
32818600,513465945,2019-08-19,66939462,Sam,Great space with an amazing balcony view and in short walking distance from the city centre. Would definitely stay here again!
26602305,568581396,2019-11-24,65815668,Linn,Thank you Spencer for letting us stay at your cozy suite this weekend! Perfect location close to restaurants shopping entertainment district etc. Super easy to navigate from Spencer’s place and easy to use public transport from here with just street cars outside. Would recommend!
8342442,327260528,2018-09-23,196096709,俊宏,"Frida is a very nice tenant and the room is very clean.
Plus the location is pretty good."
21612862,348014199,2018-11-12,65490582,William,Location couldn’t get any better. Tons of food places within walking distance. Can uber to most places around $10-$20USD. Clean quiet stylish place kind hosts would definitely come back if I’m in the area!
18024250,483662305,2019-07-07,64430652,Yana,Great clean room and amazing location - a two minute walk from Bathurst station. The tub/shower is shared among 2 other rooms but there is a second toilet downstairs. Room has a nice window to the backyard that can be opened. We had a hot weekend in the city so the older vent system in the home does not cool the room very much. Overall Frank was responsive and the Airbnb is a perfect place to crash after exploring the city all day.
25143615,401001423,2019-01-13,216317343,Bianca,Great experience!
18476496,208027053,2017-10-30,106953992,Britney,YoonMo was a great host and always communicated well with me. The pictures make it seem like a tiny area but the space was actually bigger than expected its perfect for two people. It was also great to be above the variety store it came in handy. Thank you so much :)
31026502,459490141,2019-05-27,1216118,Julie,My friend and I had a fantastic time staying at Galina's place.  The views were incredible and we felt like we were living in the clouds.  The apartment was in close proximity to a lot of neighborhoods; we'd definitely stay here again.
28667162,419215817,2019-03-03,10732969,Ahmed,Beautiful views over the city good location and private toilet too!! Soheil is helpful in giving local tips. Had a good stay. Definitely recommend.
19890926,215747160,2017-12-01,71100702,Thomas,"Rosa was an absolutely wonderful host especially since I had just moved to Toronto. She was helpful when I asked questions or for advice but she let me do my own thing otherwise. 

The space was super clean and there is laundry in the apartment which was a great feature. The fireplace is perfect and it became a nightly ritual for me.

Overall I stayed there for an entire month and really loved it."
5959077,74766524,2016-05-16,6339713,Kevin,A wonderful stay at Vahan's place. It is exactly as pictured with a great view over the city and Lake Ontario. Very comfortable with all the little necessities. Vahan was a great host very communicative polite and helpful.  Would absolutely stay again.
3476587,120920864,2016-12-12,72687520,Sarahbelle,"If you are looking to live and explore like a local this is the place for you. Walk a couple of minutes and you're at the St.Lawrence Market. Walk a little under 10 and you're at the Distillery. So many great foods to eat at the market (beautiful meats and cheeses lots of gluten free and vegetarian options) and the local shops in the Distillery offer everything from jewelry art hats candles clothes- anything your heart desires. Eat at El Catrin if you like Mexican food. The restaurant is beautiful decorated with sugar skulls. 

Convenience wise there is everything you'd ever need around you- Shoppers Drug Mart takes care of all your personal care/prescription needs and a 24 hour Rabba Fine Foods is steps away if you need any grocery items.

The apartment has a lovely king size bed that is very comfy. The bedding is soft and warm.

The kitchen is stocked well to cook all the delicious things you may buy at the market.

The bathroom has a poster of the movie The Labyrinth (my fav movie of all time)! Every time I used the facilities I could hear ""Dance Magic Dance!"" in my head. It made me smile. The bathroom is well stocked with towels.

In regards to our vehicle we found a parking lot right across the street. We stayed three days so I asked the parking attendant if we could pay for three days upfront instead of having to pay a day rate and night rate each day. Three days cost us $60.

Adam is a lovely and communicative host. Always responds promptly to any messages questions and concerns you may have.

There were two downsides to our experience:

1) The apartment is on the 4th floor. Which is great when the elevator is working. However two out of three days of our visit it was not working. This made it very difficult to get our luggage downstairs when we checked out. I have scoliosis and my boyfriend has a shoulder and back injury. We are now quite sore from having to lug our stuff down all those stairs.

I totally understand that this is not the fault of our host. But it did impact our enjoyment of the venue.

2) The water pressure in the shower is very weak- felt like a trickle. I have long thick hair and it would have taken me an extremely long time to wash my hair. I elected not to and relied on dry shampoo to get me through the weekend.

All in all it was a positive experience and I highly recommend Adam's loft if you are looking for a venue in the heart of the city."
11324869,461474769,2019-05-31,230516747,Megan,Check in was easy and the place had plenty of space and a huge bed and nice backyard. The coffee machine was great and there were nice shampoos and conditioners provided. Great place would definitely stay again!
16271333,199237465,2017-10-01,88096278,Kathy,Dynamite location quick to communicate comfortable accommodations. This place is perfect if you want to be centrally located!
6844443,456819157,2019-05-22,70055853,Frank,Great place greeting at lobby is a nice touch. Bottles of water also. Recommended
27289776,431764577,2019-04-01,135988052,Niharika,Such a lovely clean house to stay in. Great location with only ten minute walk from the subway. Really quick responses and easy checkin.
10682351,83126529,2016-07-01,40315106,Zev,Lovely space very comfortable with great amenities. Fantastic location. Ben is an excellent host. He is very timely and on top of things. Answered all my questions and provided for all my needs in a very friendly manner. I am definitely staying here again. 
4616714,46855510,2015-09-14,19699041,Michel,Clean suite nearby the cn tower. Eugene is helpfull. Nice view from the 19th floor.

4240983,105668987,2016-10-02,15916617,Zoey,"Abigail's place is beautiful and true to description. The bed and sheets are as comfy as any hotel and we loved the character of the decor!

Abigail was quick to respond to any questions and helped us out by giving us a late checkout (post-Nuit Blanche that was super appreciated). Excellent host place to stay and location! Highly recommend and will likely be booking again sometime."
16464473,224237438,2018-01-02,90542771,Claudia,"Peri is a nice host really flexible and helpful. We really liked staying with her. 
The house is in a nice location (walking distance to most sightseeing attractions) but not in the best condition (older interior and bathrooms). 
It’s a good place if you don’t plan on spending much time in the Airbnb (beside the nights)."
12007571,462867194,2019-06-02,152388534,Kefei,The room was really clean. The host gave a very clear instruction so you would not need to worry about the difficulty of finding the location. There are many restaurants around the house. The only thing needs to concern is that the sound insulation is not very good. I had troubled in sleeping on the first night because of the sounds of people talking and walking outside. Strongly advice to bring you earplugs. It was much better on the second night when I had my earplugs.  It was still a good experience. The location is good and price is great.
21822791,348035837,2018-11-12,27733795,Monique,The unit was perfect for us.  There were 6 of us staying together and it was perfect.  The living/dinning/ kitchen area was perfect for socializing together.  Although we did not cook the kitchen was adequately stocked and we could have prepared meals if we wanted to.  The location was great.  We walked to restaurants to Second City and to the theatre.  The choice of nearby restaurants within walking distance was amazing.  Everything we needed to have a pleasant stay was present.  The unit was exactly as pictures and clean.  The building itself was nice and the concierge desk and security present were an added bonus.  It was also very nice to have parking included.  I recommend this unit!
24038307,334272708,2018-10-08,2500003,Luke,Outstanding location lovely apartment and amazing views across the city. Would love to stay again!

Space enough for 4 people. 
All clean and organized. Ron provided us with the instructions and asnwered quickly ours questions. 
Easy access to the garage and a few minutes from metro.  
Calm and safe neighborhood."
13740019,272446712,2018-06-03,168749155,Wendy,This suite is conveniently located on a quiet street close to all amenities. Bill is a congenial and accommodating host. I definitely would stay here again. 
7051337,163383680,2017-06-24,132206213,Natalya,Diane was a great friendly host! 
390395,195488765,2017-09-19,54085795,Christine & Sébastien,"Sean est un phénomène. Accueillant naturellement et en s'essayant au français il n'est pas avare de renseignements d'arrangements. Le tout sans effort et il en devient attachant. Mi casa es su casa n'est pas seulement une plaque dans sa cuisine c'est un art de vivre. Même si l'on a peur de déranger Sean nous met à l'aise de part son attitude.
Sinon pour les détails techniques la salle de bain est propre le lit est confortable la chambre est lumineuse et il y a la clim pour rafraichir la chambre quand on frôle les 30° comme ce fut le cas. Et le logement est bien situé. Nous avons tout fait à pied mais le bus est à côté pour se rapprocher du centre.
Une petit clin d'œil pour le balcon où la décoration m'a rappelé Key West."
25232133,525255071,2019-09-07,8125561,Kyle,Great place to stay in Kensington market. The view is as good as it gets. Within walking distance of almost everything in Toronto. Remarkably quiet for being in such an active area.
16251382,536932358,2019-09-27,175663172,Kelly,Great location and convenient to everything. Nice neighborhood and having parking on site was wonderful. The noise from people staying upstairs was quite loud so the provided earplugs were necessary.
3940044,301742041,2018-08-04,67094982,Katie,Matt was very kind and helpful during our arrival process. The street parking was relatively easy to figure out and pay for. Overall a great spot in a cute location walkable to great food and not too far outside the city center. 
5611320,181430372,2017-08-12,87956286,Jenna,Amazing location but the couch and bed were very uncomfortable. And supplies in the unit were very limited i.e. No toilet paper paper towel 1 fork.
19933919,232387634,2018-02-04,46872389,Laeticia,The area isn’t all that great for my taste. It’s a Jamaïcain neighbourhood but the house is great. We loved our stay there. I like a clean and warm house on a snowy night. Give yourself time to find parking.
1673003,9056286,2013-12-03,6470946,Niels,In our many years of renting vacation apartments worldwide rarely have we been as pleased as we were during our week-long rental of Veronique’s enchanting house in late November 2013. We are a professional couple with two small children. Our initial contact was very informative and Veronique responded immediately to all of our follow-up queries. Veronique was an absolutely consummate hostess. Our flight was delayed for two hours but she waited patiently for us until we arrived at 9:00 PM no less. She had everything on hand - bread milk bottled water tea & coffee (great espresso machine) sugar etc. Veronique had prepared a handy written guide including all contact information in case we needed help as well as every possible aspect of the operation of the house. She also provided us with a fantastic guide to the area with the best stores and restaurants indicated on the map which she prepared. The house is absolutely beautiful and the photos do not do it justice. It has been remodeled and updated with all of the modern amenities while retaining the its original charm. The kitchen has everything that one could imagine the living/dining area is very comfortable with a large dining table and superb chairs. The twin sofas are a pleasure to curl up in to read a book watch the large LED TV or just to relax and chill. Downstairs there is a half bath and the laundry area with a full size washer and dryer. Veronique provided the laundry detergent and softener as well as all the other supplies such as toilet paper paper towels etc. Upstairs there are two bedrooms a master and second both with very comfortable beds as well as a modern bathroom with a shower. The master is large and both bedrooms have ample closet space. There is a large deck off the living dining area which has a dining table and chairs as well as a gas barbecue. We hope to come back in the summer to take advantage! There is also a large one-car garage in the back for those that have a vehicle. We told Veronique that we had a minivan so she moved a table to the side so that there would be ample room for it. If you do not have a vehicle the area is extremely convenient for getting to just about anywhere in Toronto. The Yonge/Lawrence subway station is a short ten minute walk. We used the subway several times to go downtown in order to avoid traffic and parking and the whole experience was seamless and terrific. The Yonge/Lawrence/Avenue Road area is one of the most chic in all of Toronto. The area is home to some of the city’s finest restaurants as well as some of its most interesting boutiques. We thoroughly enjoyed visiting the area and only regret that we did not have more time to explore it entirely. We cannot wait to return! We highly recommend Veronique’s beautiful home for those who who...

30037743,433038332,2019-04-05,245180891,Corey,"Simon’s place is as advertised. The location is second to none especially if your plans include CN tower Rogers center. Scotiabank Arena or anything in that area. 20 minute to eaton center will allow you to see some of the city otw. Taking the UP express train from Pearson to the apartment was perfect. 25 minutes takes you to union station; a stones throw away from the apt. Starbucks Longo’s (supermarket) subway sportsbars all minutes away. 

If I’m keeping it real this place was good but could use some repairs or freshening up.  Balcony door is broken so closing it took a bit of finesse. The walls were stained in the hall and bathroom which could be eliminated by paint or a good cleaning. Taking a bath was out of the question because the drain plug does not seal to prevent water from escaping. Sections of the privacy blinds were missing so you don’t have total privacy from other buildings in view. 

If I was there with a buddy for a sports weekend for example none of the aforementioned would be an issue.  Having a family in tow highlighted some of these minor problems especially when there was an opportunity to compare with another apartment in the same building where friends were staying. 

All that said I would rent again as I’m sure Simon will have these minor issues addressed at some point."

5758430,64996871,2016-03-10,26985447,Brodie,Beautiful place to stay in a great location. The apartment was clean and all of the furniture and appliances looked brand new. Communication with the host was easy. Thank you.
25663882,366358172,2019-01-02,6334657,Ellie,Sameena's place was clean comfortable and conveniently located. My girlfriend and I had a lovely stay at her spot. She was flexible about check-in time and communicated back with us quickly. Sameena herself is super chill and provided us with some cool local spots to spend our New Year's Eve. Will definitely consider Sameena's spot upon returning to Toronto!
9237282,114208858,2016-11-16,35198560,Rohan,It is such an amazing place easy to find clean and perfectly located  We will definitely be back.
1115379,201568896,2017-10-08,148955773,Don,We booked 6 nights in the apartment. We arrived in the evening and found the apartment easily. It is a small appartment in an old and a bit smelly appartment house.  Location was good.  The kitchen was clean and well equipped but beyond that  not all was as clean. Couches in the living room were unseatable. The smell of the towels and hair on the pillows and linens made us go to the laundry in the middle of our first night. The dust on the shutter made us cough. opening the door to the balcony was not worth it because outside there were lots of flies. We had to find another place before the end of the period.  When we told the host about all this she explained that the problem was our high standarts.
21312473,510073916,2019-08-15,71105238,Charles,Me and my gf spent 3 nights in the basement room. We both liked it so much. We checked in the room and we were like WOW!! Tamar is also really nice. Our schedule was busy so we didnt have much time in the house. But definitely gonna choose there when i visit toronto again.
28932516,350049550,2018-11-18,78871276,Kelechi,This is a great place centrally located close to shopping.  Very beautiful and modern. Plenty of amenities in the house. I love the open layout! very comfortable.

40357957,571859016,2019-12-01,174631947,Jesse,Great location clean place friendly host! Would definitely stay here again
40456,374069,2011-07-15,601647,Jessica,The place was great! We arrived in Toronto a bit early and he let us check in.  There was construction going on in front of the house during our stay. We were gone most of the day and usually returned at night so it didn't bother us. Our host was very helpful and friendly. He gave us a tour and explained how everything worked. The nearest grocery store is only a couple blocks down. Good location. We would stay here again the next time we are in town.
20902086,262631220,2018-05-09,85730031,Hniangchin,I’ve stayed at this hosts other listings before and had no problems but I can’t say the same about this trip. They are not out to accommodate their guests. There were a lot of minor issues that shouldn’t have happened. The unit was cold with no blankets available. They don’t supply the basic toiletries and asked me to step out of the unit and go into other place to grab things that should’ve already been in the unit I paid for. The only issue that was fixed was the wifi. I asked for a refund back and they offered 5% which is a tiny incomparable sum of what I asked for back. I won’t be back at their other listings. I’m disappointed and not satisfied with this trip and hope this team uses this experience as a way to improve their services for future guests.
36021034,493532390,2019-07-22,20101086,Jo,"Brittani's place was fab.  Really clean and everything you need. Check in was easy and Brittani was really responsive.
It's in a really cool area with tonnes of great restaurants locally and within walking distance to tourist attractions. We really liked ossignton street for dinner and kensington market and China town were great. We'd really recommend it."
33066872,452606144,2019-05-13,245176664,Maud,L'appartement est excellemment bien situé et la vue est magnifique. La Tour CN est à 2 pas et nous avons pu visiter les principaux quartiers de Toronto à pieds. Il est aussi proche d'un axe autoroutier ce qui permet également de sortir rapidement de la ville.
15537875,275196796,2018-06-10,160485488,Sheikha,Loved this place. Superb location and clean! And the hosts are lovely too.
35866502,535913268,2019-09-25,15453791,Sonya,Great location excellent service nice clean rooms nicely designed. Perfect place for a quick stay. I highly recommend it.
14038855,556018947,2019-10-28,4390513,Melissa,We had a full weekend with visiting family in the city and needed a clean quiet place to stay.  Jeff & Patrice’s place was just the ticket.  It was local to many restaurants and transit and a quick drive to my family’s place in High Park.  The place itself was nicely decorated and very comfortable.  We enjoyed a few movies on Netflix before heading out for the evening.  Would stay again!
13001726,159054348,2017-06-09,56696872,Catherine,It was the perfect place for me! Calme private entrance so I could come and go as I please whitout bordering anybody and 2 minutes away from the street car and buses so I could easily visit all the places I wanted. Definitely recommend the white apartment for your next trip to Toronto!
34785213,532814371,2019-09-20,44750649,Poorvi,Naomi is very responsive. Good place to stay if looking for value.
25669544,301099080,2018-08-03,39583546,Laura,Posizionata in zona vicino alla confluenza di 2 linee metropolitane e capolinea del tram. Ottima quindi per spostarsi comodamente. L’appartamento con tutti i servizi essenziali. Noi abbiamo soggiornato in giornate particolarmente calde e afose . La presenza dell’area condizionata ci ha permesso di dormire al meglio 
28244994,556029833,2019-10-28,2365564,Tavia & Jeff,A very adorable space in a fantastic location. Sebastian’s place was clean and comfy - perfect for a couple or single person visiting Toronto (though I’d say it would be a bit tight for two friends sleeping separately). My only suggestion would be to add a blind to the window on the back door for extra privacy especially now that there is a house being built in a nearby lot and the workers can see right into the space.
23632672,278673585,2018-06-18,187373341,Beth,Cute neighborhood conveniently located. Host was great explained everything and offered helpful advise on eating places and sites in the city.
9078948,230207727,2018-01-27,15931537,Jordan,The view alone should be the main reason to book Nancy's flat. The stylish flat itself is another. The cherry on top was Nancy's attentive communication and flexibility. I had an amazing stay here and I wouldn't hesitate to come back.
2786035,244332806,2018-03-18,81194772,Luiz Carlos,"Essa foi nossa primeira experiência com o site e ficamos positivamente surpreendidos como a facilidade e transparência de todo o (Website hidden by Airbnb) relação a estadia todas as informações descritas no anúncio condizem perfeitamente com o encontrado. A casa é exatamente como a vista nas fotos exceção feita a TV que nas fotos está em um rack e agora está afixada na parede. 

Também ficamos gratamente surpresos pela atenção gentileza e cordialidade do proprietário (Ricardo) para conosco. Sempre pronto para ajudar. Efetuamos cerca de três contatos via site e pessoalmente visando tirar dúvidas pontuais e que foram prontamente respondidas. Não tivemos nenhum tipo de problema de qualquer espécie com as acomodações e/ou proprietário.

Como citado na descrição a família possui uma criança pequena que ocasionalmente gera alguns barulhos brincando e correndo pela casa mas nada absurdo e que no nosso caso não chegou a nos incomodar em nada. 

Ficamos muito confortáveis com as acomodações mas como sugestões de melhoria poderíamos citar 2 itens: 
- aumento da quantidade de panelas disponíveis na cozinha (encontramos 1 média 1 pequena e uma frigideira);
- a cama poderia ser mais alta e forte pois ao se movimentar ela fazia alguns barulhos/rangidos e o colchão poderia ser mais alto e de uma densidade maior/mais firme;

A única coisa que sentimos falta e é necessária é uma máquina de lavar mas como já citado no anúncio essa já está nos planos de ser implantada ainda em 2018.

Recomendo s todos fortemente a locação deste excelente espaço. Em nossa próxima ida à Toronto já sabemos onde ficaremos.. :^)"

32290915,423538596,2019-03-14,165837235,Michael,"Karl's place has a great location for exploring Toronto and it was nice and clean. The beds are very comfortable and there was plenty of space for the four of us. There was lots of lighting so it was nice and bright.

There are some low bulkheads in parts of the ceiling which might be uncomfortable for anyone over 5' 10""."
2832297,361460311,2018-12-23,215532590,Ying,The place is super good and the hosts are kind and friendly. You won’t regret to live here.
16258018,258675296,2018-04-29,90509975,Joe,Mike was willing to let me check in earlier than expected. I was very grateful to him for this. I suspect this was why there was no toilet paper and the garbage bins were filled when I arrived. Otherwise I had a wonderful stay. Great views.
16680448,160462486,2017-06-14,116919926,Stacey,I stayed here for over two weeks and it was absolutely perfect!!  Totally self contained beautifully decorated and wonderful view.  Right from the moment of first booking this place and right through to the end of my stay Mike made himself accessible and extremely helpful.  Can't wait to come back!
12988600,128300428,2017-01-23,111435138,Lorraine,Charles was very accommodating.  The place is nice comfortable and clean and walking distance to groceries and restaurants.  It's a great neighbourhood.  Very quiet.  There's lots of room in the suite and having 2 bathrooms was a real bonus!  I would definitely stay there again.  
26628568,548016578,2019-10-16,300348189,Cédric,Such a great house and perfect host! I recommend you this place

34124019,526141274,2019-09-08,1441742,Véronique,Notre séjour dans l’appartement de Bianca était très bien pour ce dont nous avions besoin pour un week-end. L’appartement est très propre pratique et très bien situé.  Seul bémol il n’y avait pas de machine à café alors qu’il y en avait une sur les photos. Nous avons fait le commentaire à Bianca et elle a dit qu’elle en fournirait une à l’avenir.
8628082,102262022,2016-09-17,11236935,Ashley,This was a perfect spot to stay!! The location was convenient and close to everything. The condo was clean and comfortable. I felt very welcome and safe.

14510316,279747552,2018-06-21,144488366,Mary,Place was great! New and modern. Subway station right across the street. Eric was accessible and eager to answer all our questions!
3987246,312962005,2018-08-24,2692847,Pat,If you arrive at night the neighborhood may seem a bit run down. Don't let that deter you though! Elaine and Greg's home is large and welcoming. It's a friendly casual place where you can make yourself a pot of coffee and hang out with other travelers if you like or not. Elaine is a wonderful and helpful host. The rooms are clean and comfortable and you can do a load of wash for $3 if you need to. Located very close to the city center we opted to leave our car there and take Lyft instead of having to worry about parking and this worked out nicely. You can't park longer than 3 hours on the street but there is a parking garage with low rates nearby.
41887,159774687,2017-06-11,34944373,Emmanuel,Kyle's place was awesome. Very close to the subway it was easy to get downtown and explore the city. Apartment was clean and suited us perfectly.
17682560,146156377,2017-04-21,123988391,Jiae,Good location clean and quiet place. Everything was as it was described! Highly recommended!
30592619,556098732,2019-10-28,57674798,Nedhi,Great location! A 6 minute walk to CN tower. The apartment got a little warm even when the heat was turned off but other than that everything was great. Joseph was easy to reach at all times. The couch in the living area was different from the pictures posted but it was still nice!
20091567,299780834,2018-07-31,109504952,Laurie,This property is in a prime location. We walked everywhere for the week. Lots of restaurants and activities within a mile. Modern building with amazing amenities. Loved the gym and rooftop patio/grill.
35946501,562872355,2019-11-11,135933619,Emily,Wonderful host!! Very accommodating and helpful.

35545955,572395882,2019-12-02,214027733,Blake,I did a long term rental here for 1 month. The location is wonderful and I enjoyed being so close to Eaton center. The unit was fully equipped with everything you would need while visiting: stocked kitchen utensils towels WiFi and cleaning supplies. The giant tv was a nice perk and it was very quiet for a large complex. I would definitely stay again. Thanks for being a great host Norman!
18341582,300156802,2018-08-01,104213092,Lynn,Clean well located secure good car parking and feast facilities. Valerie was a great host. 
17046530,172384307,2017-07-20,115462602,Firoz,Roksolana & Demetre's place was ideal for us to stay in all aspects we recommend it to all families.
1813948,16226039,2014-07-23,694993,Nick,"Great view and central location minutes away from King St -- always easy to catch an Uber in minutes to get around town.

Extremely clean throughout although no hand or bath soap was provided.

A bit smaller than the photos suggest but not in a bad way; the bed / couch / table layout was very livable. 

Host was nice and checkout was simple. Would stay again!"
32638075,484848455,2019-07-09,3415609,Riccardo,Best place for value in Toronto
5942478,516685194,2019-08-24,147430786,Cheryl,I love staying at Dana's!  It is very walkable to the Eaton Centre shopping mall restaurants and other amenities such as Ryerson University and Greek Town.  The neighborhood is historic quiet and her suite is extremely clean cozy and has everything I need.  I continue to come back to this Airbnb because she is such a caring host.
27108691,312055129,2018-08-22,21086604,Lindsey,Absolutely gorgeous place. Very spacious. The bathroom was incredible. The toilet was something to behold. Super easy check in. Great location lots of free street parking. Was a pleasure to stay there. Probably the nicest AirBNB I have had so far. Great value for the price. 
15870170,418205300,2019-03-01,177002044,Kayode,Nice clean place highly recommended
3172930,20533535,2014-09-30,21459010,Pete,I enjoyed this place so much I booked in more time here. I've left a more complete review on my second stay
24131986,346711661,2018-11-09,3756641,Krista & Jordy,"Rachel’s apartment is a sanctuary in the city. It is perfectly located near everything (Starbucks and other cafes streetcars/transportation great shopping restaurants grocery and health food stores pharmacies a gym yoga and pure barre studio) and is still amazingly both serene and very quiet. The whole experience feels very decadent! 
As a person who rarely finds a truly comfortable bed I can honestly say that this is one of the most amazing beds that I have ever slept in! Not only is it king-sized but the mattress is incredibly comfortable and the pillows are perfection - as are the pristine linens! 
The little back deck - and it’s gorgeous row of lights hung along the edge of the railing - is a tranquil dream! We loved popping out to enjoy our morning coffee and evening drinks! 
Rachel has done a truly amazing job of choosing perfect decor that allows anyone and everyone to feel - and to make themselves - perfectly at home. As a coffee lover I loved that she so thoughtfully included a Nespresso machine and pods. So good! For tea lovers there is a beautiful blend as well as a tea ball (with handle) and a kettle. 
As an Airbnb host and as a guest I also really appreciated that Rachel very quickly and thoroughly responded to our questions. As so many guests have noted Rachel thinks of everything. 
My husband and I loved our stay and can’t recommend Rachel’s space highly enough!"
19801676,237333560,2018-02-22,61014635,Christin,"Communication was good the place was easy to find and check-in and the interior was beautifully decorated!

26846655,312071646,2018-08-22,168259554,Verna,Lina and her family are very friendly.  They answered any questions we had.  We enjoyed our stay.
21382275,529277587,2019-09-14,92460860,Matt,Although I only saw Maria and Thomas once they were exceptional hosts. I was a bit late off the plane and they waited for me were extremely hospitable and it’s a great place to stay. I have been to this area before the one thing I would say is that the distance it looks from the centre of town should NOT put anyone off booking. The streetcars from Roncesvalles are easy regular cheap and convenient and Roncey itself is lovely. Great hosts lovely basement room and whole thing was excellent.
20895835,313039720,2018-08-24,182978298,André,Tara offers a nice and cosy room in the lovely Palmerston Blv close to both Bloor Street and Kensington Market. The appartment is also well connected by subway and streetcar to all major areas of Toronto. The interior is well equiped making the stay very comfortable. Hence I would highly recommend this room to anyone who wants to enjoy the city avoiding the stress of downtown of Toronto.
32773278,526863988,2019-09-09,79537356,Melissa,The unit is located in a great area. There are a ton of restaurants and bars close by. St. Lawrence Market is a few minutes away by foot. Check in/check out is incredibly easy. The hosts were very responsive. Once you get used to the front door you're fine.
21596152,218678537,2017-12-14,29799176,Letitia,The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5598800,98269425,2016-08-30,5241032,Jennifer,We had a wonderful experience staying at Charmaine's apartment.  It was conveniently located and Charmaine was incredibly communicative before check-in and throughout our stay.  The apartment itself was great: clean comfortable modern and very well-stocked with essentials.  Overall I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Toronto.  
20527686,463541457,2019-06-03,152974246,Mike,Great place to stay with great host
18707109,523401517,2019-09-03,44510060,Lidia,The apartment is in very convenient location and nice well maintained building. Kitchen with all its appliances was very helpful since we often prepare our food by ourselves. Very enjoyable stay!
22308870,305007225,2018-08-10,178110652,Saad,Great amenities and in a good location. Everything was perfect it was very clean and we appreciated the helpful tips for the city. I would definitely recommend staying here if you plan on visiting Toronto!
21395710,434830813,2019-04-08,112437069,Eugene,The place is both extremely comfortable and amazingly well decorated and modern (it's like being on an episode of HGTV after the renovation). The mattress and pillows are very comfortable. Venus and Wesley were extremely accomodating and attentive and their little touches were much appreciated. Also the location is great. I was attending a conference at the Toronto Metro Convention Centre and it is a short walk and actually closer than several of the other conference hotels.
13714921,171429616,2017-07-17,56361394,Kyle,Very clean room with an easy check in and check out. Within walking distance or a short Uber ride of everywhere we wanted to go within the city. The amenities and pictures of the place are spot on and accurate. I think the entire floor is rented out on Airbnb so it feels more like a hotel which is fine by me.
6154561,178094020,2017-08-04,104110906,Kaarina,Neil was a very gracious and welcoming host. The room was very comfortable and the house is in a fabulous location exactly as advertised. Such a great find!
25911704,519417958,2019-08-28,85900596,Victor,Great room size walls need more insulation for sound and wifi needs to be upgraded.
15758980,177618348,2017-08-03,45565482,Sibylle,We were six people and had a wonderful stay in Toronto. The house was great also the host and neighbourhood. Really easy to walk downtown.

3464606,530991218,2019-09-16,18847850,Shirley,"The room was even better than pictured clean beautifully appointed and well designed.  I particularly enjoyed the private en-suite bathroom super convenient.

The check-in process was super smooth and communication were prompt and clear.  I loved the little note at my room door that welcomed me.

I also had the pleasure of meeting Harry and having an hour+ conversation with him I just wish I had more time to hear all his incredible+interesting life stories.

When I come back to Toronto next time I’m definitely staying at Harry’s and definitely for longer than a night (:

He desertall the superb reviews he has!"

15903030,555346955,2019-10-27,251677992,Chloe,The apartment itself was nice and clean; however me and my guests (4 females) felt threatened and unsafe due to being consistently harassed by a man who seemed to be security but am unsure due to the fact that he was not wearing a uniform. Unfortunately we will not be returning to this site nor would we recommend it to anyone.
6091034,367345024,2019-01-04,93952975,KokSiong,A lovely place to stay if you're spending a few days in Toronto. The location is fantastic as it is only about 50 metres from the nearest TTC Streetcar station. If you cook you can't but appreciate the very well-equipped kitchen.
34685098,508334425,2019-08-12,167819235,Xu,Shahrooz’s place is just like my home. It is fully equipped one bedroom apartment. You can cook your own foods. You can do laundry within the apartment with washer and dryer. The location is very convenient for travelers. Within 10 minutes walk you can get to grocery stores a large variety of restaurants and Subway/Transit buses. Within 10 minutes driving you will get on highways. By the way Shahrooz provides you with a underground parking place. The best part: if you are from different time zones you will wake up with the city and enjoy the sunrise!

6215198,443760944,2019-04-26,228139475,Jésica,This has been my first experience using airbnb and yet I am very satisfied. We were given the opportunity of an early check-in in addition to that the house is very cozy and warm the rooms are very clean and spacious. Very close to the Finch West station. Thang and his family were always on the lookout and they solved our doubts if I get back to Toronto I'm going to stay here. :)

16986849,188768952,2017-08-30,138962489,Jessie,The first thing I noticed about Clarita's place was how clean it was! I felt comfortable staying here and would choose to stay again. The place is a quick walk (about a block or so) to the nearest bus station which is very convenient. She was always very responsive and very helpful if we needed anything extra. A nice bonus was that she provided us with delicious snacks and fruits! It was also very quiet and the bed was very comfortable.  I would recommend staying here and I would come back again if I were to visit. Thanks for hosting my friend and I!

33017712,492601747,2019-07-21,182946889,Julia,We enjoyed our stay at Arya’s place. With traffic it’s 30-40 minutes outside of downtown Toronto. The AC was broken during our stay but Arya was helpful and accommodating.

Deanna made us feel very welcome with tea/coffee and helped us with recommendations for places to eat and advice on using the transport system. The apartment is in a great location and we could walk to most of the places we wanted to go in Toronto. It's great value for money and we were really happy we found it! We would definitely stay again.

Terrace is big enough to eat outside and relax. I recommend it 100%
2267889,215268522,2017-11-28,58368495,Mengfei,Genevieve is nice and replies messages quickly. Since I'm from San Francisco I felt chilly at first. Genevieve is so kind to turn on the heat. The place is spacious and clean with most of the amenities you need. The only downside was the footstep noise coming from upstairs. Overall it's pleasant and great value!
13781103,359704066,2018-12-17,68396261,Doug,Great place with gas fireplace cable TV comfortable bed. Loads of amenities super helpful host. Convenient location lots of shops and restaurants close to streetcar lines.

We were able to walk downtown and enjoy the nightlife within walking distance. The place was easy to find but check in was just a little confusing. The apartment is a standard Toronto apartment modern and cozy.

23836052,559635752,2019-11-04,48340644,Yana,We stayed for 2 nights and never saw/met Francis which worked out well anyways because he was very responsive and patient whenever we had questions for him through the airbnb app. His place is simple clean and a very close drive to downtown Toronto. He allows guests to use his kitchenware & appliances- a bonus for us. Overall a great stay.
29783630,486362963,2019-07-12,43513381,Jeannette,Everything you could wish for in a fairly central location.  Main attractions walkable from here.  The apartment was outstanding and the facilities rooftop swimming pool and bbq area really made this a fantastic place to stay.

A casa é muito bem localizada tínhamos carro alugado mas o ônibus para na porta. 
O estacionamento é ao lado da casa na porta de entrada.
Eu com certeza recomendo apesar de não ser exatamente no centro eu até prefiro por ser um lugar mais calmo mas com tudo perto. Restaurantes supermercados etc.
Infelizmente não reservei esse espaço para a viagem toda se soubesse teria feito.."
21293203,204112429,2017-10-16,2860630,Stu,I was very lucky to find this place. It was very reasonably priced and my hosts were so helpful. The area is very nice and well-connected also.
224775,36632578,2015-06-29,22585304,Katie,Frank was a great host. His place is very quiet. He has a dog but the dog is calm and doesn't bother you in case you don't like dogs. His place was very clean. The room was large and had a desk and office chair a clothing rack to hang clothes on an alarm clock and the bed was of average comfort.  It is a great location. I would highly recommend staying here. It felt like a home!
29599414,487008692,2019-07-13,17367042,Wenpin,I think it good?
12943889,192070354,2017-09-09,72518625,Steve,"First off I'll start with the positive aspects of the place:
Great location and great view of the city.

Now for the negatives
Dirty and not up kept. Needs a lot of work. 
Not presented like the pictures posted 
Mould in areas of baseboards
Only two towels for a 4 night stay.
Bugs in kitchen area of the house.  I could keep going on and on but I'll leave it at that. Very unimpressed with the pictures and actual appearance of the place listed."

7292461,173553095,2017-07-23,74477937,Letizia,Chose to stay at Kristi’s because the location and the price were right. Needless to say the entire experience exceeded our expectations. Beyond the availability of free parking Kristi’s place is in a wonderful quaint location just outside the city that allows for simple public transport or walking to get in. The space itself was cozy and just perfect for a Toronto get-away. Hands down would stay with Kristi again!

19591910,290034993,2018-07-13,134903551,Olivia,A nice clean apartment with neat decor and only a few kilometres from the downtown core. The air conditioning was also definitely a plus and works great! 
8169606,100967908,2016-09-11,18237860,Sven,Whitney was a perfect host! The arranged everything for me from getting into her flat and all the cool things arround it. Communication was at its best.

22390245,428028483,2019-03-24,248947069,Julio,Very convenient and well-located apartment (at a walking distance from Downtown Toronto). The hosts were very kind and left everything prepared for our arrival. Everything was explained in the ad perfectly.  The only thing is there is only one bathroom for more than 5 people so getting ready in the morning can be time consuming. All being said for visits to Toronto I will definitely consider this apartment again and I strongly recommend it for others.
33015767,469993266,2019-06-15,255998390,Kim,Location was great.  Everything went very smoothly.
27976899,368219363,2019-01-06,228903971,Bassam,i reserved this Airbnb around 1 month in advance. so I had a lot of time to imagine what it'll look it and be like. but at the end it was still better than i imagined

4779505,103083857,2016-09-20,37575965,Kirk,The listing description was very accurate although nothing was mentioned about the residential renovation construction noise 2 houses away from the property which woke my parents at 5am on a couple of occasions though Patricia probably wasn't aware of it so we don't blame her at all. The area is beautiful & green neighbourhood and everyone we spoke to was polite & helpful. It is only minutes walk away from the beach which was ideal. Netflix was a bonus for the quiet nights my parents & spent in.
6766284,47215040,2015-09-16,19598188,Kassina,"Jea was an absolutely fantastic host! She accommodated our request for an early check in time and provided us with all the information we needed for the building. She was quick to respond to text messages and while we didn't have any emergencies we always felt like she would be available if anything came up. Her place is awesome and in such a great location we would definitely stay here again!

14122952,120445521,2016-12-10,12684414,Samuel,Max was a fantastic host! He gave a very thorough walk through of the key and room procedure his place is very clean and the location of his apartment is ideal for those who need to get downtown quickly. I was mostly out for work during the day so it was wonderful to have such a great place quiet and comfortable to return to afterwards! 5 stars!

20902125,504328296,2019-08-07,140911636,Alice,This apartment is best for the able bodied young (or young at heart). It is up two tall flights of stairs in the very happening Greektown. It is worth every step! A very comfortable bed and a well outfitted kitchen. It is close to a grocery store bars and restaurants and lots of nightlife. Be prepared to have a good time.
18112815,368944657,2019-01-08,149413091,Faisal,Good place
24748547,305667020,2018-08-11,12189611,Emmanuel,Nous avons passé 2 nuits dans la maison de Jay et tout a été parfait.  Jay nous a accueillis chaleureusement et nous a donné toutes les explications dont nous avions besoin sur  le quartier  les transports etc... Intérieur de la maison parfaitement propre largement de place pour  2 adultes et 3 ados lits confortables  déco soignée . Quartier cosmopolite sympa   avec commerces   restaurants et situé à environ  20 minutes de tramway du centre de Toronto (arrêt à  2 minutes de la maison).  Aucun point négatif  nous recommandons ce logement.  
33079772,527305465,2019-09-10,141600126,Jasmin,Well located very clean highly recommend!
19497395,338487538,2018-10-19,12677928,Cynthia,The photos for this condo are accurate and the views of CN Tower Rogers Centre etc. from the windows are amazing. Location is right by the Union Station and Scotiabank Arena as well as the Longo's grocery store. The essentials (body wash hand soap shampoo conditioner hairdryer) were provided. A nice extra touch would have been providing hand soap and paper towels in the kitchen. There weren't a lot of cable TV channels but it was great to have Netflix available. The unit is right across from the elevators although you can't hear them once you're inside. On really windy nights it felt like you could feel a draft from the windows.
14916561,181909543,2017-08-13,129573643,Harold,Great home base  for 6 adults. Close to transit. under $20 to Uber downtown

17327411,554051934,2019-10-25,283487399,Yvonne,Suzette and Sham were great hosts and responded very quickly to questions. The unit was in a great location was clean and modern and was a good size for five guests. The codo was also fully equipped. The beds were a bit uncomfortable but everyone has different preferences. There were issues with check in so make sure you get clear instructions and don't plan anything too close to check in as it took an hour to resolve issues. All in all a great place and stay.
33900058,570512686,2019-11-29,116533740,Andreanne,Great location great value. Easy check-in and very responsive hosts. Taller folks will have to duck around the uneven/low ceilings but the otherwise stylish space made up for it. We overall enjoyed the space and will recommend to friends travelling to this part ofToronto. Thanks Chris and Cami!
20617985,419224106,2019-03-03,98851659,Myriam,"AJ’s place is a recently renovated flat tucked away in Greektown. We had a good stay for our weekend and found relatively good value for our money - I felt like the pictures did the place justice. However a few details kind of missed the mark to give this a five star rating. 

Our communication was nice and smooth with AJ the self check-in went very smoothly. The entrance to the building feels a little sketchy at first especially if you arrive after night fall since the door is behind the building and requires you to walk through an alley way and parking lot. There are motion censored activated lights however they take a few steps in the dark before turning on. This was made worse as the alley and parking lot had not been cleared of snow recently and it was quite a significant amount of ice and no salt. Large icicles  were forming above the entrance way also creating a safety hazard. 

Dishes in the cupboard were dirty and there were stains on the cooktop. The outlet on the kitchen counter can’t be operated at the same time as the oven making it tricky if you want to cook some eggs brew some coffee and make toast in the morning at the same time. 

The bedding was rough and scratchy and only offered a duvet no top sheet. The pillows felt flat and cheap. Minimal furniture in the space and an awkward layout really make it only ideal for a short stay crash pad. 

If you’re looking for a no-frills stay in Greek-town this might do they trick for you."
18520456,186106485,2017-08-23,68693316,Jia Yin,This is a great location and safe neighborhood we drove up from NYC and was able to park on the streets thanks to Peri. Kitchen was supplied with all necessary cooking utensils. The view of the CN Tower was a great addition to our stay.
26938284,491765922,2019-07-20,41114456,Kelly,Great stay! Great location! Clean space. Trendy and easily fits 5-6 people despite the seemingly small size of the space.
17855818,260384937,2018-05-04,88785194,Alexandra,This was a great place to stay in Toronto. It is relatively close to everything— (I’m not too keen on many of the neighborhoods in Toronto as I feel they are a bit odd).this is not a high rise condo downtown by any means but in a neighborhood. It is extremely clean and has great updated touches. I felt very at home and very comfortable.
14694692,138292987,2017-03-19,903754,Stephen & Guadalupe,Erin's place was great for our group of friends going out for the night will definitely use it again if the need arises. 
27758537,321517699,2018-09-10,99443239,Manny,Place was very clean and very easy to get in and out of. Parking was also very convenient. The view was also spectacular. Would definitely recommend this place

21205564,343440208,2018-10-31,191587806,Ignacio,So far everything is going very well ah it was a good experience this first stage thank you!
20480363,211272368,2017-11-12,76424168,Mitra,I stay in a lot of airbnb's in Toronto and dont normally write reviews but had such a nice experience Cassandra's place was really cozy and home-like. Just like the pictures (cozier) and house had everything you need - tea fridge stove extra towels plants amazing rooftop. location isnt downtown but great if you already are familiar with the city or if you want to get to really know the city :)
14318223,101157421,2016-09-12,87178570,Asifa,Great host and apartment! Lori made the entire process super easy and smooth. She was easy to reach and responded very quickly to any questions and with the logistical information I needed. The apartment is in a great location with the subway and all essential amenities close by. It was easy to get into the downtown core area and the shopping in the neighborhood was great. The apartment was just like the pictures and description and very quiet. Loved staying here and would definitely stay here again.
18579525,318318997,2018-09-03,73679458,Marco,"Jamie and Lucan were super kind responded quickly and gave a lot of useful recommendations about todos restaurants bars etc.
I can totally recommend staying at their place."
16548328,431280227,2019-03-31,185875998,Sharon,The place was really nice and amazing location  however cleaner was not done when we got there had to wait an extra hour. The no doors for the rooms was a turnoff as there was no privacy even blinds would have been okay .
18670446,446879774,2019-05-02,111131913,Elizabeth,Very neat a lot of beds perfect for our big group. Beds are comfortable 4 pillows each bed. Mike was quick to respond my message and booked us last minute since our other host canceled 2 days before our reservation.
18179294,191722458,2017-09-08,141222338,Hassan,Very nice person
23871506,522869201,2019-09-02,32966869,David,Good location close to many restaurants and bars around. The host knocked on the door early the day we checked out and we were not ready to attend. Would ask for a bit better communication before coming down while there are still guests in the house.
16437963,565432892,2019-11-17,111596508,Shilan,"This was a great place to stay comfortable and great location. Lots of necessary stores and restaurants close by. We went with a big family for a wedding we had a little one with us. It was comfortable homey and safe and fun for our little one enough space to move around as well. 
Thanks Thomas!"
17775203,490393100,2019-07-18,155583377,Daniel,A great location and easy access with parking at an additional cost.
10752614,276055488,2018-06-12,62102425,Jamiece,One of the best air bnb experiences to date. Clear instructions on pretty much every need. Great area to eat tons of cute shops and you can catch the trolly into downtown really easy. The communication was also great anytime I’m in Toronto I’ll be trying to book this place again.
22552298,504338792,2019-08-07,147339285,Renée,Great place and location! Esther was super responsive and kind enough to offer recommendations for local spots to check out. There were nice restaurants and shops within a short travel distance (less than a 10 min walk or drive) that you can explore if you don’t want to head downtown. Nice quiet area. Very accessible by public transit. Great WiFi. Would definitely stay again!
8241557,129193943,2017-01-29,411727,Jessica,Claudia and her family were incredibly welcoming - it's clear that for both her and her parents being a host isn't merely a side-job but a true joy.  I just wish I could have stayed longer! 
15986161,210893337,2017-11-11,17846087,Preksha,Great place! My friends and I loved the place - big apartment. Host was very accommodating too.
19311538,207973207,2017-10-30,87530220,Monica,Loved the place! It was roomy and Craig made us feel like home. It was a quiet neighbourhood but st Clair isn’t a too far walk to go to be around the hustle and bustle of a downtown atmosphere. Thank you so much for making our reunion a great memory for us to remember
22100548,544220246,2019-10-09,100430225,Rebecca,"Great location but we had a little trouble finding the place after walking from our parking spot. Maybe I didn’t catch a heads up to look at the map?

Be prepared to pay for offsite parking a few blocks away. Toronto’s parking app is pretty easy to navigate. 

My friend slept on the pullout and the mattress was very thin and we couldn’t get it back together. Lastly nearly a third of the vertical blinds were missing and stuffed in the closet. We had to wake up in total full daylight."
18329896,228609318,2018-01-20,66981681,Jon,Great host.
20549931,307020336,2018-08-13,10410608,Deb,"I had a wonderful time in this studio apartment it is perfect for a couple or a single person for a short visit. The neighborhood has all you need good restaurants and places of entertainment: museums art galleries movie theaters are within walking distance.
Daniel was gracious enough to respond to my call late one evening when I needed his assistance to straighten out a misunderstanding about parking my car in the building which he resolved instantly…I fully enjoyed my stay."
17832256,158436840,2017-06-06,552216,Brent,Great place in a very central area of Toronto with a great host.
35576664,474798904,2019-06-23,269780626,Jessica,the view was amazing even more beautiful than the pictures show
28486449,409077236,2019-02-06,48280736,Troy,This was my second stay here within a two month period and things were a smooth as the first time around. Underrated is the secure parking available (I've read about how scarce parking can be) especially during inclement weather. Very quiet clean and convenient - highly recommended. I'm sure I'll be back if Kevin doesn't mind :)
20772163,561443593,2019-11-09,35105383,Jack,Amazing
6900207,91963619,2016-08-07,23226446,Michael,Britney and Paul provided us a wonderful experience. Everything we found was as described. The location is excellent - you feel both a part of the city and away from it enough on their very quiet street to feel on vacation. Neighborhood has many restaurants cafes and shops in the adjacent blocks. B's and P's kitchen had everything we needed. Their living room extremely comfortable as were their beds.

19498271,459624637,2019-05-27,40541610,Mo,Nikki’s place was great. It’s nestled in a white neighborhood which is actually quite a bit away from the city centre. Lots of space and easily accessible. Billie was real accommodating and answered lots of my questions which i had a lot. Her place was nice and comfy and an overall great stay.
25169257,275136025,2018-06-10,145119062,Monica,The place was great. And Sabrina was really great with communication. The location was perfect for me considering i was coming from the airport. Overall really great experience.

13406543,178982963,2017-08-06,143590436,Tri,near downtown & quiet area & next to the beach. Great photos for memory can be taken with the background of Downtown without going to the hustling chaotic of big city in Toronto.
29012696,463029871,2019-06-02,55168174,Florence,Accommodation  exactly as described and photographed. Great view on the lake or from the room. Too bad I was only there on a grey day..:-) I truly appreciated Gregory's responsiveness and communication. Highly recommend to stay there if you are ok with skyscrapers... :-)

I would definitely stay here again."
15058542,120460874,2016-12-10,1623138,Yossi,Tyler was easy to reach and quick to respond. The place looks exactly like what you see in the pictures. It's located in a great place in the city close to bars / restaurants / clubs etc. - Literally all a 5 min walk away. Warm cozy and a balcony with a view. Highly recommend this place for a business trip or a fun little couple's getaway. x
6748289,42949563,2015-08-16,35886486,Shadi,I stayed at Sahrjee's place for two nights and I have nothing but good things to say about the host and the condo. Sahrjee is one of the most friendly and outgoing people I have ever seen she made me feel home within seconds. The place was clean and she made sure that nothing is missing the location is perfect right in the heart of downtown. 
36110830,539970538,2019-10-02,177572245,Jane,My stay at Darren and Derek's was splendid in every way.  They've created an immaculate private classy environment for their guests.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again when I'm next in Toronto.  Top-notch accommodations!
2843818,39532254,2015-07-24,37325386,Tereasa,Paul and Jennifer were the perfect hosts! The apartment was clean orderly and had everything we needed. They even provided snacks for us- and special treats for our 4 year old daughter! Their home is only a very short walk from the subway and bus station and it's also very close to many great restaurants and cute shops. Very easy to travel in and out of the city from their location. We had a great experience! 
12973673,267767801,2018-05-22,158197830,MoMo,A very flexible & comfortable stay!
23166623,363860337,2018-12-29,103903042,Peter,"This place is in a great location and that is by far the biggest plus. 

The condo is extremely small and the blinds on the windows are not in good shape so don’t expect to have much darkness at night time.  The dryer did not work and the place was generally dusty and the towels were smelly perhaps because the dryer didn’t work.  Bedding was minimal and not that comfortable.  Soap in the bathroom was almost pure water and there were lots of little things that needed fixing. The pool was not great my kids didn’t even want to go in and the hot tub was not working.  Please be aware that the place is dusty in case you have any dust allergies.  A good cleaning a trip to IKEA new blinds/curtains fixed dryer and some basic maintenance and this place would be okay.

The hosts were very good at communicating and very good at check-in.  As mentioned the best part of this place is the location."

14859789,215971574,2017-12-02,19522039,Mark,Although the house & room were clean I could not get in. The host provided an out of date code and another tenant was nice enough to let me in. The host was unreachable so I may have been waiting in the cold for over an hour to get into the house.
17331637,415775379,2019-02-23,244419655,Gail,The host at this location is very nice the space is very clean and comfortable. It has great parking a very good location.  I will be definitely staying here again.

Unfortunately we never did meet our host but he gave us very good instructions and we were able to let ourselves in.  
The mechanism for coming and going in the building was complicated.  Fortunately the concierge staff in the building were very helpful."

13256555,329302770,2018-09-28,14527434,Devapriya,"The location is good; close to a train station bus stops restaurants grocery store. 

About ten steps to climb from street level - I was expecting more. 

The room overlooks the street but there’s hardly any traffic. But Yasmine keeps ear plugs handy for guests in case they need it.

The room has a closet to hang jackets etc. and a chest of drawers which is handy for unpacking since there is not much floor space to keep an open suitcase. 

All in all a good place to stay in when visiting Toronto."

11529071,154027532,2017-05-22,129560699,Janna,"If I had to do it again I would and I definitely will in the future!

We came from out of town to visit our family and this was the first time that we have stayed in Toronto for close to a week. I would have to say they had a great home set up for us. There were 2 bedrooms and a living room and we were able to fit 5 people in here very comfortably. 

The location was great. It was connected with the shopping mall which made things easier for us and there were also many other stores within a 10 minute walking distance. 

Emil had gone above and beyond what I had expected him to do. I did not read the instructions right and did not know that I was supposed to rent a parking card from him if I wanted cheap parking. So when I called him I explained and he worked with me and tried to help me out. I saved myself A LOT of money because of him. My biggest advice is if you need help don't hesitate to call they are willing to help you out.

The only issue I had was navigating throughout the parking garage. It had taken me 5 days to finally figure out where I was parking and going. But that is not Emil and Heather's fault it seems that there is construction going on. "
4565516,59948776,2016-01-17,4811835,Zachary,"This was a fabulous apartment to stay in for a weekend. The amenities were as shown great location and everything went smoothly. Calvin was very responsive to all requests. He's obviously put an immense amount of work into the design of this place and it shows. Beautiful apartment.

The only minor quibble is for next time he has put a lot of thought into stocking the gorgeous kitchen but it is missing some key elements. For instance he got coffee pods and olive oil and balsamic vinegar (amazing!) gorgeous knife block but there's no spatula or salt or pepper. Again minor quibble and I only mention it because he's obviously put an incredible amount of work into stocking the kitchen for guests and there are just a few key things missing.

13151442,325093931,2018-09-18,17269766,Christie,Lynne’s space is awesome. If you are looking for a bright spacious 2 bedroom this is the place for you. Has everything you need for a comfortable stay. It’s located on a very low traffic street and a very short walk to danforth where we found lots of cafes restaurants and a grocery store. We will be back for sure!
22001921,543314183,2019-10-07,132677745,Edgar,Jay and Billy’s stylish unit was just as spectacular as it looks in the pictures. The views of the CN Tower and skyline are breathtaking. The proximity to all the downtown attractions was ideal for walking and made my stay very easy and effortless. Overall the unit is beautiful cozy and well laid out. Can’t wait to stay here again!

24431562,261474621,2018-05-06,73869492,Patrick,"I stayed in August's place while traveling for business and for a 20 night stay it was just what I was looking for!  The unit was very clean well decorated and really had everything you would want or need for an extended stay or even a short visit. All of the appliances are high end well maintained and the apartment is well laid out considering it's size.  The bed was very comfortable - it was a good blend of firm but not too firm!  August has really done a nice job in ensuring the unit had everything needed.  There is no cable in the unit but the Apple TV and SmartTV apps did the trick.  The only suggestion I would make here would be to increase the internet speed/bandwidth.  During peak times of the stay (6-9PM) internet speeds really slowed down and was tough to stream at times.  Not sure if this is a building issue router or maybe just a higher end plan is needed.

The building itself is clean and the amenities where the gym and pool is located are superb. I was here in the colder spring months and unfortunately wasn't able to enjoy the BBQ area.  

The unit also does not come with parking however I was able to find parking at the impark underneath the Sobey's Grocery Store down on Fort York.  About a 5 minute walk from the apartment and was actually convenient for grabbing some breakfast in the morning or groceries when getting home!  At the terminal in the garage you can do daily weekly and bi weekly rates.  I actually ended up doing a month however had I known ahead of time I would have done bi-weekly.  

Overall I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely look to book again! There are dozens of bars and restaurants within walking distance and overall is a very nice area of Toronto!

Matt met us at his beautiful condo promptly at the agreed upon time and showed us the parking spot in the basement and gave a tour of the building and condo.  Incredible view of Toronto from the lake up to Bloor and a lovely patio to view it from.  Super comfortable bed and sectional in living room.  Cable and fast internet and a great kitchen for cooking.  Could not have asked for more.  Will be staying with Matt again in the future.

9648319,65103628,2016-03-10,2028284,Barbara,What kind generous and welcoming hosts! I felt immediately at home upon arriving and was grateful for the offer of a cup of tea (with many choices no less). Each morning I was offered breakfast with many options including dairy-free and gluten-free which was much appreciated. Location is perfect for getting to York (my destination) easily walkable through a quiet residential neighbourhood with lots of families but also quickly accessible to a busier commercial street. The room (upstairs) was small and simple but had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again.

25208606,476565991,2019-06-26,244484200,Nikhil,Todd's place is bang near all the conveniences that you can expect. Although a bit pricey considering the small size of the room since we were a couple should be ok for a single person. Todd is a great host who responds very quickly to all your requests. He also allowed us to checkout late. I would recommend it to a single traveller. Thanks Todd!
15664293,203665676,2017-10-15,144467259,Sylvain,Great location close to everything super clean place and the communication was easy.  Everything was clearly explained.

17141329,168934599,2017-07-10,119243158,Davy,Alans place is great it is a lovely clean apartment in a quiet area but still within walking distance of the main attractions/entertainment area of Toronto (about 20 mins). There is also a street car stop very close if you don't feel like walking. The area has many places to eat and drink and is close to both Kings Street and Queens Street. The apartment itself has a comfortable double bed and the pull down couch is also good - I visited with my son and we took turns on both. Although we mainly ate out the kitchen has everything you need to cook for yourself. It has a large TV to relax in front of and stream your own movies from YouTube/Netflix. The bathroom has a very nice shower and a bath - which my son loved! All in all I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Toronto. Alan is also a great host his communication was first rate as was his help and recommendations for things to do etc.
5917524,471922516,2019-06-18,29112269,Peggy,The apartment was exactly as presented in the Airbnb clean safe and comfortable. The communication was clear and it was easy to checkin. The host was very friendly. The only comment is that as the weather was unseasonably cold the heater was probably off and the flat is lower ground we were a bit cold in the flat. To be fair we didn’t ask the host to change the temperature as we were too busy and out most of the time till late night so it is possible that there was a solution for this and that had we asked it would be rectified. We definitely recommend the place as it is exactly as advertised.
30404418,480829663,2019-07-03,1400444,Christopher,Yuri’s place was very clean and had everything we needed. Check in was very easy and straightforward. We visited during a very hot week in the summer and the place stayed very cool.

16271333,490470713,2019-07-18,177837317,Kerry,This apartment has the most amazing location if you are attending anything at Scotiabank Arena or want to sightsee downtown. The free parking and great view were huge perks. Unfortunately our stay was negatively impacted by a building-wide water outage—so no showers toilets or water of any kind. The queen bed frame was broke upon arrival making the bed horribly lobsidded and uncomfortable and the air mattresses would not stay inflated. I’m sure this apartment is perfect for most stays but these circumstances with the broken bed and air mattresses coupled with a lack of running water really put a damper on our trip.
9558303,419259714,2019-03-03,210490340,Egor,It was good place to stay for 2 weeks and everything was perfect✈️

We had to change our time due to some hick ups on the road and they had no problems with that! The apartment is very cozy and private. It's located in an amazing location with a lot of places for great food or desserts! There is a good public transportation to downtown of Toronto. I definitely recommend their apartment!

Le métro on est plus ou moins à 15 minutes à pied est évidemment très bien desservi au centre-ville.
Pour les personnes en voiture le parking est assez compliqué à comprendre au début par son organisation un peu confuse notamment pour les places. Nous avons passé 10J formidables la cuisine tout équipée a été un plaisir pour nous."

might seem sketchy at first glance it is actually really nice and there are a lot of things to do and discover. The city center is easily accessible by car bus tramway or by foot (about 45 min walk). 

Hannah has been a very kind and welcoming host. She provided us with a lot of suggestions of things to do and she even left us food for breakfast.

We totaly recommend this place for a nice stay in Toronto :)"

Walkable to almost everything- Kensington Market Chinatown midtown squares and local bars and restaurants. It's in the middle of it all but still on a quiet neighborhood street. He had excellent communication and responded quickly. We felt like locals staying here.  Highly recommend if you are busy bodies like us and just need a nice place to crash!

26304231,511577211,2019-08-17,181114790,Louise,Good space for 2 people in a great location. The kitchen area was clean but the bathroom had a mouldy shower curtain. The main area was dusty and under the beds rug and sofa had not been cleaned for a while. There was no toilet paper on arrival. Check in was easy. Just a bit more attention to detail over all would make this an excellent place to stay in central Toronto.
23439208,421082319,2019-03-08,148467640,Chris,"A hassle. Inexplicably only one key fob is provided for six occupants! The key fob is required to enter the front door and operate the elevator so coordinating arrivals is a constant headache. I wasted hours going up and down the elevator to let in companions. 47 floors are served by only three elevators so wait time in busy periods can be over ten minutes. It's crazy making. The ad states the location is ""steps away"" from the CN tower but it is about 2000 steps! Located on the west side of Canoe Landing Park it is a full mile west of the Convention Center 22 minutes walk 35 minutes by car at rush hour (due to 2019 road construction). The interior is devoid of charm with bare white walls and not a single decoration. Sleeping past sunrise is difficult as the louvered plastic drapes do not block sunlight entering the east-facing windows. Traffic noise through the thin windows is unceasing and so are the cold drafts. Fortunately coffee is provided. Closets are large but there is no dresser. The kitchen is adequate."

11727674,195264560,2017-09-18,8362772,Dario,"Our stay at Nike's place was outstanding. 

The apartment is spacious and immaculate it came equipped with everything we needed for a family of 4 (we didn't use the kitchen to be fair but it looked clean and functional). Previous reviews reported issues about noise in the second bedroom but we had no problem at all and our girls slept really well. 

There were only two (minor) issues with the apartment which didn't really affect our stay but other guests may want to know about: 
1. the beds were comfortable but also very squeaky. Keep that in mind :) 
2. wifi is good but the signal was too weak for streaming on the TVs in each bedroom. We didn't spend much time inside but after a few attempts to bring up a channel we just gave up.

Other than that our stay was amazing. The location was also perfect within walking distance from Kensington Market Korean Town and Little Italy. The area is extremely walkable diverse and vibrant. We treated ourselves every morning to fresh bread and pastries from a bakery nearby. 

Communication with our host was impeccable and we would definitely return thanks for having us Nike!"
21025345,224858323,2018-01-04,640719,Francisco,The place is beautiful. We didn't even find 1 scratch anywhere. The decor inside the place is modern. Nice wooden floors. The view is simply amazing. We could see the CN Tower from our room window it's right across the street. Starbucks is on the same building and Tim Hortons just a block away love their coffee. Wifi was good. Kitchen has everything we needed. We did a small grocery shopping the day we arrived  at a nearby store. The pizza place across the street is not that good but not bad for a beer or wine. Everything good is walking distance. Thanks much very nice stay. Will come again.

14084357,418577648,2019-03-02,47796256,Patricia,Fantastic place to stay in cold Toronto February snowy week.  Just wanted to hibernate in the cosy feeling space but had to go out and do things!  Wonderful to have some food items provided for arrival.  Hosts are very gracious and attentive.  Lovely combination of style good taste and practicality in the furnishings..
1057144,45380562,2015-09-02,28593667,Gina,Vivienne is an exceptionally wonderful lady that made my guests feel very welcome in her home. The home itself is gorgeous!
15465463,174988282,2017-07-27,123388482,BiYing (Jackie),The condo is very close to the CN Tower Rogers Centre and the Aquarium. The view from the condo is great especially in the evening when the lights are on. Darren is a super nice host. He was patient and considerate although we changed the time to pick up the keys twice. After we have lived in he sent me messages reminding me the available extra beddings. The condo is very clean well equipped and comfortable. Free parking is provided. Most importantly we all feel safe living in this building (We have a child with us.). We all had a great time in Toronto. We highly recommend that you choose Darren's condo when you travel to Toronto. Thank you again Darren!
22126823,276389499,2018-06-13,191162230,Kylee,It was perfect! Easy check in. Really clean lots of natural light with an incredible view.

15713961,431282043,2019-03-31,26173939,Chris,We had a really great time staying at Tony & Rebecca's place. It's a cozy space big enough to house a group of us without feeling too full. Beds and sofas comfy showers warm and delicious and all within an easy walk of downtown. Rebecca was quick with communication and helped us out with a couple of problems without any fuss. I'll definitely stay here next time I'm in town.
14870665,112893652,2016-11-08,96225587,Hart,"I was met by Miles when I arrived who explained all there was to know about the flat. He even took me to the local shops to assist with my first shop and helped me become familiar with the neighbourhood.
Subsequently John was always helpful and asked if I was in need of anything - but always respected my privacy. Having a kitchenette and bathroom to myself was ideal and even a lovely deck out the back. John made a special effort to secure a desk and office chair (crucial) for me when he learned I was writing a book which turned a second room into a study with still enough room to unfold a sofa bed for a guest. I was in need of a quiet place and despite the proximity to Dundas I rarely heard traffic or much other noise from the street. The neighbourhood was a treasure trove of shops restaurants and amenities. The location was excellent and well within walking distance (45 minutes) or tram (15 minutes) to downtown and U of T where I needed to be frequently. A big plus was being able to walk to the Bloor UP station (15  minutes) to catch the train to Pearson Airport. And it was also useful in coming off intercity trains at Union station where a direct line to the Bloor UP stop meant a quick return to this place. Overall I can recommend this listing for long or short stays. I stayed for a month and was sorry to leave. I had a very productive time and I attribute this to both the host and the place. Thank you."
12955428,92213510,2016-08-08,49938109,Marc,"We appreciated the nice place with à quiet and peaceful garden. We slept very Well even with the big Greek feast !

9214758,209622890,2017-11-05,9614290,Cary,It should be noted that this is a modest basement apartment.  This was not clear to me prior to arriving.  Michelle was a good host though and quite helpful.
38602803,565571830,2019-11-17,190128250,Kyle,No problems no concerns great stay.
12309629,106863587,2016-10-08,81535844,Sarah,Ryan was a very responsive host. Both the home and the neighbourhood are beautiful. 
7253645,179038906,2017-08-06,143025494,Tobi,I really liked staying there. They had a fridge with snacks and drinks I had my own bathroom and an A/C. I even washed and dried my clothes. Everything was really good for me for families it might be a problem that you have to take a bus that takes around 30min to downtown toronto and that the neighborhood is not the best (definitely some homeless drunk people) and not too many restaurants in walking distance.
13075056,279412989,2018-06-20,75459802,Stvn,Even better than expected! Had an amazing stay at Laura and Sol’s place. Would absolutely stay there again when we come back to Toronto.
20090290,297859129,2018-07-28,172365948,Nienke,"The place was just perfect. It was even better than we expected based on the pictures. 
Very suitable for kids as well: nothing that a kid could break our baby could just crawl around without any danger. The high chair and play pen were also a very pleasant surprise! 
Perfect spot to walk around the Queen West / Ossington area. And since the place is right next to a park it’s really nice to sit outside in the park. Just perfect!"
5557092,52039565,2015-10-26,10970383,Demetrios,Slim was highly communicative start to finish. Everything was as promised and as pictured. Check in was seamless the condo was clean and adequately appointed and the view of course is incredible.

5030730,484340211,2019-07-08,32467502,Agathe,We had a great time at Radu’s house! There is a lot of space and the neighbourhood is very quiet. On top of that the house is extremely well located which allowed us to discover Toronto by foot and public transportation. Before our arrival Radu sent us all detailed information about the house and the area and during our stay he made sure that everything was ok which was highly appreciated. I strongly recommend this place!
15698833,457654264,2019-05-24,44377080,Phyllis,What a wonderful stay!  The apartment was spotless comfortable quiet and in a great location.  Couldn’t have asked for more.  Jason was super quick in responding to questions and it was an awesome visit.  Highly recommend!

Its location and neighborhood were very conveniently close to downtown in a very nice residential area. We also enjoyed very much the restaurants within walking distance close by.

37216750,555234065,2019-10-27,151880053,Olaf,"Die Wohnung ist in einem Hochhaus und ca. 20 Minuten von Down-Town entfernt. 
Die bunte Church Street auf der einen und die lebhafte Yonge Street auf der anderen Seite sind ein guter Ausgangspunkt für unternehmungen in Toronto.
Die Wohnung selbst ist klein und relativ schlicht-schick eingerichtet - eine klare freundlich helle Einrichtung. Aus dem Bett auf andere Hochhäuser zu schauen gibt ein nettes Großstadt-Feeling.
Sharmilla ist wirklich sehr schnell mit ihren Antworten. Das Ein- und Auschecken lief absolut unproblematisch und sehr unkompliziert ab.
Eine klare Empfehlung."
35673340,564350106,2019-11-15,146376298,David,Excellent space and private area. Can’t wait to be back for Toronto getaway #2.
19085132,368360620,2019-01-06,16063440,David,Perfect location. Dead quiet street yet right downtown steps from Carleton and Yonge (and the subway). Amazing coffee (Black Bear espresso) and middle eastern food half block away on Carlton just east of Yonge immediately north of the house. Extremely clean apartment. Comfy clean bed. No unpleasant smells anywhere. Comfy sparse living room. No noise from any neighbors. Excellent and prompt communication throughout immediate response to any inquiry I had. Would definitely stay again. Thank you!

We got to Toronto a bit late but there was no trouble with checking in and entering the apartment. The living room is gorgeous!! And the cat was our favorite part!! Bria was also kind enough to leave us some of the best beer in the fridge as well as coffee for us to enjoy in the morning. Overall 11/10 would reccomend!!!
23880006,326552314,2018-09-22,99960291,Jan,Being in Little Italy made our stay in this little gem a unique experience.  Attention to detail and the luxury of two bedrooms  was just like a home away from home

13682156,162376823,2017-06-20,60726187,Marc,"Appartement idéalement situé dans le quartier branché / huppé de Yorkville.
Appartement moderne agréable bien meublé et equipé sauf pour la terrasse qui est malheureusement non meublée et donc inutilisable.
Lit trop petit pour 2 personnes (140 x 200).
Les stores à lamelles n'assombrissent pas assez la chambre.
Les portes de chambre et de salle de bain grincent beaucoup ce qui réveille le conjoint au cours de la nuit en cas de lever nocturne 
Très appréciable d'avoir un lave-linge qui fait également sèche-linge.
Lave-vaisselle hors service et pas d'éponge ni de torchon pour faire sa vaisselle à la main.
Environnement de l'appartement très bruyant (bruits de la rue voitures badauds mais également chantier dans l'immeuble voisin et surtout la climatisation de l'appartement et de celui du dessus).
Un checkout à 10h du matin est beaucoup trop tôt !

3683593,19484554,2014-09-13,18343160,Lauren,Location location location! This place was perfect for walking everywhere we didn’t even need to take the subway. We booked this condo for 3 nights and Sanjeev was really easy to get a hold of and great with answering questions either by phone or email. The concierge and security staff were great and helpful during our stay. The condo is really nicely furnished clean and spacious. If I have to put one small negative it was that the street noise at night gets pretty loud but that’s a small price to pay for the prime downtown spot (bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper). Would definitely stay again in the future. 
28895681,530115514,2019-09-15,240222920,Aaron,Great place amazing view and top quality communication durning our stay. Highly recommend

Every time we come it feels like a home away from home and Matt always does everything he can to ensure every last detail has been considered for our family. The space is clean well equipped good for children and in the best location. You couldn't ask for more.

4838440,50735298,2015-10-13,46293139,Sydney,My first stay at an Airbnb was great thanks to a good host and an amazing place to stay. Adams place was the perfect location and had a gorgeous view. He greeted me at the beginning but then I had the place to myself all weekend. I felt like I was in a gorgeous hotel but for a much better price. Overall great experience. 
6603099,138391412,2017-03-19,14249663,Andrew,Shirin is very hospitable and welcoming. Her house is warm and very clean. The location is fine close to shops and supermarkets and centre of town about 15mins walk away.

35389898,530312918,2019-09-15,261886461,Madison,"We had a group of 12 girls attending a bachlorette party downtown and Ron's townhouse was the absolutely perfect place for all of us to meet up! Ron was an amazing host and although we didn't get to personally meet him the small touches he left around the house for us were awesome! 

The layout of the house was great and everything was totally spotless when we arrived. The best part was that there were multiple spots for everyone to hangout in from the outside the place looks as if it'll be a bit small but once you're inside it's incredibly spacious! Definitely made our entire weekend the girls couldn't stop talking about how much they loved the place!"

Would have been nice to be able to go for a swim.

29741612,458862572,2019-05-26,22327153,Jessica,We didn’t get to meet Massimo due to our late arrival but he was gracious enough to send me very detailed check in instructions that made our entry easy and enjoyable. The house is even better and larger than it appears in the photos. The location was wonderful. It was located near grocery stores liquor stores restaurants and coffee shops. I highly recommend this property!

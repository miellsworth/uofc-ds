# Cluster Sampling
$$U = \text{ Population}$$
$$N = \text{ Number of primary sampling units or clusters}$$
$$S = \text{ Sample of the primary sampling unit}$$
$$S_i = \text{ The sample of the secondary sampling unit from the } i_{th} \text{ primary sampling unit}$$
$$y_{ij} = \text{ measurement of the } j_{th} \text{ element in the } i_{th} \text{ primary sampling unit}$$

## Primary sampling unit level
$$N = \text{ Number of primary sampling units or clusters in the population}$$
$$M_i = \text{ Number of secondary sampling units in primary sample unit } i$$
$$M_0 = M_1 + M_2 + ... + M_N = \text{ The total number of secondary sampling units in the population}$$
$$t_i = y_{i1} + y_{i2} + ... y_{M_i} = \text{ measurement total of primary sampling unit i}$$
$$t = t_1 + t_2 + ... t_N = \text{ measurement total for the population}$$
$$V_t = \text{population variance of the primary sampling unit totals}$$

## Secondary sampling unit level
$$\overline{y}_U = \frac{t}{M} =  \text{ measurement mean for the population}$$
$$\overline{y}_{iU} = \frac{t_i}{M_i} =  \text{ measurement mean for the primary sampling unit } i$$
$$V = \text{ population variance}$$
$$V_i = \text{ population variance within primary sampling unit } i$$

## Sample quantities
$$n = \text{ number of primary sampling units (clusters) in the sample}$$
$$m_i = \text{ number of secondary sampling units in the sample from primary sampling unit } i$$
$$\overline{y}_i =  \text{ measurement mean for the sample from primary sampling unit } i$$
$$\hat{t_i} = M_i * \overline{y}_i = \text{ estimated measurement total for primary sampling unit } i$$
$$\hat{t} = N * \frac{(\hat{t_1} + \hat{t_2} + ... + \hat{t_S})}{n} = \text{ estimated measurement total for primary sampling unit } i$$
$$v_t = \text{ estimate of the variance between primary sampling unit totals}$$
$$v_i = \text{ sample variance within primary sampling unit } i$$

# Ratio Estimation

$$y_i = \text{ measurement at sample number } i$$
$$x_i = \text{ auxiliary variable}$$
$$N = \text{ population size}$$
$$t_y = \text{ population total of measurement y } = \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i$$
$$t_x = \text{ population total of measurement x } = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$$
$$Ratio = B = \frac{t_y}{t_x} = \frac{\overline{y}_U}{\overline{x}_U}$$
## Simple random sample
$$\hat{B} = \text{ Ratio estimate } = \frac{\overline{y}_S}{\overline{x}_S} = \frac{N * \overline{y}_S}{N * \overline{x}_S} = \frac{\hat{t}_y}{\hat{t}_x}$$
$$\hat{t}_{yr} = \text{ ratio estimate of the population total of measurement y } = \hat{B} * t_x = \frac{\overline{y}_S}{\overline{x}_S} * t_x$$
$$\hat{\overline{y}}_r = \text{ ratio estimate of the population mean of measurement y } = \hat{B} * \overline{x}_U$$
$$\hat{N} = \text{ population size estimate } = \frac{t_x}{\overline{x}_S}$$
